0.32 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.40 - the Baptista and I have a trade idea for
3.96 - you today January 19th
6.80 - 2024 only a few more days left before
9.88 - Christmas and the new year let's see
12.44 - what's going on in the market &ps up 42
15.64 - handles they've actually had a nice big
17.12 - range today you can see here they were
19.12 - over 6,000 at one point they were under
21.48 - 5940 to 5980 let's call them mid-range
25.12 - uh up 41 NASDAQ up 106 Russell uh up and
30.44 - the Dow up 283 volatility in by 25 cents
35.36 - unfortunately with my trade that I'm
36.84 - going to show you here today um I'll
39.24 - make this short and sweet for you
40.92 - markets moved a little bit since I put
42.64 - this trade on you can see I put this
44.32 - trade on if you want to going to the
46.68 - follow
47.96 - page uh just a few moments ago of
50.44 - filming this you could see right here at
52.16 - 10:20 this morning uh when spy was 580
57.04 - well just under 589 now it's a full
60.36 - dollar almost a dollar higher so the
62.40 - trade that I'm going to put on um it's
64.28 - moved so maybe you want to wait a little
65.96 - bit what am I looking to do here well
67.48 - first um as I always do I like to go
69.88 - into my high option volume list I like
72.12 - to look at the ivy rank I like stocks
74.12 - that don't have earnings a lot of stocks
76.08 - are having earnings uh in January I
78.92 - looked at coin it has earnings in
80.60 - January looked at a few others they all
82.08 - have earnings in January so I wanted to
84.08 - go to something that's really going to
85.56 - be affected by volatility because I
87.36 - think
88.12 - volatility VX um is at its highs uh
92.28 - obviously you can see here over the last
93.48 - couple days at its highs yes it's been
95.44 - higher this year um but this is about
97.76 - the high end of its range and I want to
99.56 - look to sell puts because in spy there
103.00 - is put skew meaning that sk's trade of
106.20 - that puts trade higher than calls equal
108.96 - distance away and the further out of the
110.36 - money you get those puts really hold a
112.80 - lot more premium to them you can see
114.32 - here that the uh volatility is really
116.96 - uptick the last couple of days I'm going
119.04 - to play for a little bit of reversion in
120.88 - maybe the market and maybe a little
122.64 - reversion uh in volatility meaning
124.88 - volatility go lower so what am I looking
126.60 - to do here no earnings to worry about um
129.36 - no dividend to worry about now I got a
131.76 - lot of great feedback by people talking
133.36 - about um the dividend uh little hack
136.56 - that I gave you I'm going to do it one
137.84 - more time for you I'm going to go to the
139.96 - January 29th options uh just to give you
143.52 - uh a quick little look here on what it
145.36 - would be the dividend is around a 170ish
149.16 - maybe that's on the highend you can
150.92 - figure it out by doing the reversal
152.32 - conversion but let's just assume that
154.16 - it's a$ 170ish that means all these
156.44 - calls under 520 are going to have
160.60 - dividend risk why because the put all
163.12 - you have to do is look at the
163.88 - corresponding put those puts if they're
166.56 - trading under the dividend price like
169.32 - here they're trading at $165 that means
171.28 - it's a nickel to somebody to exercise
173.32 - those 520 puts maybe they 520 calls
176.00 - maybe they won't exercise them but
177.68 - they're certainly going to exercise the
179.08 - 440s the 445 maybe this is not
182.24 - compelling to you by trading the 29 day
184.32 - options but if you're trading the
185.84 - shorter day options like maybe the D One
188.32 - Day Option you're going to keep a
189.44 - position on overnight because it either
191.44 - goes for you or against you or you just
193.08 - want to have that position on when you
195.04 - look at that same thing what options on
197.24 - the call side are going to be exercised
199.12 - if the dividends around
201.00 - $1.70 yeah those 585 and lower really
205.84 - maybe people won't do it for a for a
207.44 - dime but they'll do it for 20 30 40
209.36 - cents look at the open interest on these
211.60 - 584 with the stock trading right here
214.00 - right now tomorrow you'll see this open
215.56 - interest uh in the teens or maybe a 100
218.16 - so there's going to be a lot of these uh
220.48 - calls being exercised if you have a
222.52 - position on even if it's a full winner
224.64 - you're going to cost yourself the
226.08 - dividend even if it's a full loser
227.32 - you're going to cost yourself more of
228.48 - that dividend so quick little hack any
231.12 - stock this works with any stock whatever
233.20 - the dividend is if you're short a call
235.68 - let's call it the 582 or even long a
237.96 - call 582 and the dividend is over the
241.68 - put price in this example uh $1.70 these
245.84 - 582 calls will definitely be exercised
249.40 - all right what am I looking to do uh I'm
251.76 - looking to do a 1 by two ratio spread uh
255.48 - 29 day options January 29th um why not
259.28 - February because I just want a quicker
261.04 - time frame on this I think uh I don't
262.92 - want to be in this for the next uh month
265.16 - or and a half I want to be in this for
267.00 - the next week or two expecting a little
268.48 - bit of a rally in the market and this
270.12 - will move quicker with a rally in the
272.72 - market if I'm shorter dated what am I
274.60 - going to look to do here I'm going to
276.20 - buy the 550 puts one time I'm going to
280.16 - sell two two of the 540 puts I'm going
285.28 - to do this and I did do this for
287.76 - $2 $2 credit I know it's traing for
290.40 - around a $1.75 or $177 right now
293.40 - obviously the stock is rallying um this
296.20 - trade has a 95 96% pop a PO positive
299.96 - data decay of $1
301.60 - 1225 uh a long Delta of seven well
305.24 - outside a one standard deviation
307.08 - expected move you normally don't get
308.44 - these kind of pricing uh with volatility
310.92 - in the teens like it was earlier 15 16
314.00 - 17 but when you get in the 20s you can
316.40 - take it a little bit of Advantage if
317.80 - you're mildly bullish or omnidirectional
320.96 - because remember at
322.72 - 540 you can make $10 on this trade
326.36 - because those 540 puts would be worth
327.76 - nothing those 550 puts which along would
330.24 - be worth $10 it does use
332.72 - $6,700 in buying power so if that's too
335.84 - much buying power for you well listen
338.16 - you can go to any option you want and
341.00 - decide how much you want to kind of
342.60 - waste because really that's what you're
343.92 - doing here I'll just go to these uh 75s
347.64 - I change my uh my my my credit in this
353.08 - example by 30 I had $2 up there it's
355.56 - trading closer to $150 now but if I
357.88 - change if I did this at $2 I'd be only
360.12 - able to make $1.70 but I changed my
362.64 - buying power by enough no not enough cuz
364.84 - look it's $6,800 so you got to move this
367.64 - to what you think your buying power
370.08 - would like to be um reduced by and
373.56 - you're going to have to go closer and
374.72 - closer and closer until you can get it
376.28 - to be reduced by something that's under
378.80 - your number here you go now you're down
381.20 - to $3,000 would it be worth it to buy
383.48 - these puts at
385.24 - a125 probably not so for me you either
388.88 - have to have the $6,000 in buying power
391.96 - to put on this trade or $6,800 in buying
394.28 - power to put on this trade if that's too
396.20 - big of a trade for you then this is not
398.56 - the trade for and you will see look at
400.28 - how this moves around it was just $170
402.84 - $1.75 now it's
404.64 - a182 Market doesn't look that great here
407.36 - today uh with the way it's sold off and
409.48 - volatility um kind of staying bid only
412.12 - down nickel right now so I don't know if
415.04 - I was going to put on this trade I would
416.40 - probably wait until we see a little bit
417.52 - of capitulation maybe see the NASDAQ G
419.76 - PS uh turn into the red anyway that's my
423.00 - trade for today oh I forgot to show you
425.56 - volatility has been up pretty nicely or
427.20 - I think maybe I did in spy it's up
429.28 - almost 10% over the last 5 days and the
432.60 - ivx or the IV uh ivx is up almost 10%
436.32 - the IV rank is up 46 so that's my trade
439.16 - for the day omnidirectional slightly
441.80 - bullish 1 by two put ratio spread you
445.88 - have a Merry Christmas enjoy yourselves
