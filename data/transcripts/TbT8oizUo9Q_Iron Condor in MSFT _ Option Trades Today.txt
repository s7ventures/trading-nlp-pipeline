0.32 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.48 - the bat batist and I have not one but
4.76 - two trade ideas for you today on this
7.20 - scary day in the market it's Halloween
9.60 - and the market is giving us a big scare
12.00 - let's see what's going on before we look
13.56 - at those two trades Ean S&P is down 90
16.84 - handles they're just off of their lows
19.24 - of down a 100 that's over a 1 and a
22.12 - half% move so far and it's early in the
25.08 - morning NASDAQ down 445 that's your
28.08 - leader to the clubhouse to the downside
30.12 - well over 2% to
33.08 - 20,990 Russell down 26 and the Dow down
38.48 - 426 down 1% volatility up a118 that's a
43.92 - 6% move and a number we haven't seen in
46.64 - quite some time 2050 if you notice here
49.48 - we got up to around 2050 back on October
52.32 - uh 8th we also got up this volatility on
55.92 - September 6th volatility is certainly
58.88 - percolating it's percolated over the
60.80 - last couple of days we talked about that
62.80 - on this podcast on Tuesday just 48 hours
66.88 - ago how volatility was expanding and the
69.48 - market was continuing to go higher a
71.92 - little bit weird on that until you got
73.92 - these two down days yesterday and now uh
77.56 - today bonds are down 22 ticks uh no
80.64 - flight to Quality here uh well maybe
82.76 - there is a big flight to Quality as
84.88 - bonds go lower rates go higher usually
88.28 - people looking to buy bonds to keep uh
91.44 - uh their their risk in the equity Market
94.48 - to a minimum go to the flight of quality
97.52 - of bonds uh buy bonds rates would go
100.88 - lower rates are going higher right now
103.16 - don't look like any rate cut on my
104.88 - scoreboard right now and Bitcoin after
106.92 - getting to 73,0 71 and change oil's the
111.04 - big mover probably the only mover to the
112.92 - upside uh that we look to trade if
115.08 - you're not looking at volatility it's up
117.44 - one and a half% a dollar eight or so to
123.20 - $696 okay I told you I have uh not one
126.40 - but two trades today uh the first one
128.44 - I'll give you is the easy one Microsoft
131.28 - Microsoft msft a post earnings trade
134.88 - Microsoft down $24 today uh on earnings
139.12 - actually up uh pre-market right after
142.44 - the earnings came out sold off uh
144.80 - significantly down $24 and change as the
148.28 - day has worn on today here you see
150.72 - Microsoft down here obviously no
152.48 - earnings because they came out uh today
154.76 - volatility was actually uh in Microsoft
157.36 - the ivx 5day change was unchanged uh
160.56 - when I put this trade on not too long
162.28 - ago the ivy rank is 46 and change you'll
166.56 - notice it got down to around $46 in
169.60 - change which that's about a dollar uh or
172.24 - so lower than where it is right now and
175.28 - up to 416 I'm going to do a defined risk
177.96 - trade in Microsoft uh since the
180.52 - volatility is still elevated you're
182.48 - basically getting
184.64 - pre
186.36 - market rank IV rank when it's post
191.16 - earnings already so like you know it's
193.28 - like it's like we're getting the the
195.76 - volatility expansion of earnings after
199.28 - earnings so I'm going to do a Define RIS
200.80 - tra here because it is a $400 stock and
203.52 - would use a lot of buying power if you
205.32 - weren't using defined risk trades I'm
207.40 - going to go pretty classic here uh I'm
209.92 - going to go down to the 365 puts that's
213.56 - just about the 15ish Delta let me get
215.92 - rid of the open interest here because
216.92 - the open interest as you can see is huge
219.08 - let's go to open interest and change it
220.68 - to Delta since I have probability of
222.36 - being in the money you know you can see
223.80 - the in the money probability and the
225.28 - Delta are basically the same uh we
227.48 - typically say it's one or two Delta
229.24 - difference it's just one Delta
230.68 - difference at this moment anyway I'm
232.44 - looking to sell the 365 puts and I'm
235.36 - also looking to sell the
237.92 - 455 calls that is a straight Delta play
241.96 - they both have around 13 or 14 Deltas uh
245.48 - on on this trade the 13 on both of them
248.40 - right now you're going to see a little
249.72 - bit of change on the wings that I buy
251.64 - but you can see here there's a $44,000
253.92 - trade okay for for my account but I want
257.16 - to define the risk here do something a
258.92 - little bit different uh go a little bit
261.20 - wider I'm actually going to go
263.08 - $15 wide for those playing at home I'm
266.08 - going to go down to the 340 put that's
268.92 - $15 wide and I'm going to go up to the
273.44 - $470 call which is $115 wide um I was
278.28 - able to do this at
280.64 - 296 uh when I placed the order was about
283.52 - 2 cents under mid price so maybe you can
286.28 - get
287.20 - 297 um if you have the same experience
290.04 - that I do that change your changes your
292.36 - buying power to
294.48 - $2,200 uh instead of being completely
296.56 - delta neutral it gives you maybe uh you
298.60 - know two long delas but as you can see
301.04 - the short strikes are the same look at
303.44 - the uh win on the upside meaning look at
307.20 - this this dotted line This dotted line
310.16 - is the standard deviation to the upside
312.32 - we're outside that because this green
314.04 - line shows you our break even and we're
317.60 - outside of it to the downside there is
320.00 - 50 days to expiration I do like to go
323.68 - closest to 45 days with the um uh
328.68 - monthly options so these options would
330.92 - be the ones that I'm trading these are
332.16 - the weekly options wouldn't be looking
333.96 - to do that and with 15 days into
336.04 - November that's way too close for me
339.52 - this trade has uh $6 a day in Theta
342.16 - Decay for the $2,200 that I have at risk
345.00 - it has a 76% Pop I like to have probably
348.32 - a profit over 65% this certainly fits
351.36 - that bill uh this is a trade that is uh
354.12 - wants the stock to stay inside its
356.28 - expected range you can see here that the
357.92 - expected range is just under $30 in this
361.80 - elevated IV and Ivy rank that we have
365.24 - here uh your break evens are under 265
369.16 - and over
370.60 - 455 if you notice here 455 uh is just
374.80 - off of the highs and
377.00 - 365 uh is brings you back to uh January
381.04 - of this year so for me this is a a post
384.68 - earnings trade with volatility that's
387.08 - still reflecting because of what's going
389.32 - on the market and everywhere else it's
391.32 - still reflecting High implied volatility
394.12 - that's my iron Condor defined risk
397.48 - trade using relatively small buying
400.96 - power from my account again your account
403.56 - might be different SPX well if
406.60 - volatility is expanding in the overall
408.32 - market then it's certainly expanding in
409.96 - SPX because SPX is uh the market and
413.16 - this may only be day one but I'm going
416.04 - to take a little bit of a flyer in SPX
418.72 - on this day one because it may be day
420.80 - one but you'll notice look how many days
422.92 - of the market we've taken out already
425.16 - we've taken out uh we're back to levels
427.20 - we haven't seen uh since a month ago or
430.36 - so so I'm going to look at my patent
432.52 - pending
433.76 - omnidirectional broken wing butterfly
436.68 - but I'm skewing it a little bit more
438.76 - because These Wings Are bid meaning
441.12 - volatility as I showed you once uh
443.92 - earlier when we did the show when we
445.68 - started this podcast is at a level we
447.84 - have not seen for many uh we have seen a
450.84 - few times but we haven't seen that often
454.00 - I'm going to look to take advantage of
455.28 - that by going a little bit wider on this
457.80 - SPX trade that I normally do let me
460.44 - explain to you what I'm talking about
462.28 - just like I talked about Microsoft we
464.36 - like to go uh around 45 days I like to
467.76 - use the monthly options again in SPX
470.64 - there's there's liquidity everywhere you
473.28 - can go to whatever month you like I like
475.36 - to go to December uh am options 49 days
479.16 - close to 45 days I'm going to go in
481.80 - those I'm going to go down to you know
483.56 - broker wing butterfly is buying uh one
486.36 - spread and selling another spread
488.84 - typically twice as wide as the spread
492.04 - you're buying I'll show you on the
493.20 - screen so you don't have to follow along
495.36 - with just uh my voice here I'm going to
497.88 - go down I like to go down to around the
501.52 - 15ish Delta again that standard uh
504.84 - deviation so I'm going to go all the way
507.20 - down to the 5300 puts uh you'll notice
511.00 - here that they have a 17 Delta when I
512.76 - put this on even the S&S were only down
515.20 - around 80 so you can be able to do this
517.32 - better than I did it so I'm buying the
520.68 - 5300 puts I'm going $50 wide and I'm
525.12 - going to sell one of the 52 50 puts now
529.28 - I said a broken wing butterfly is just
531.28 - buying one spread and selling another
535.12 - spread now typically what I do is I sell
538.64 - the body here again so I'm going to make
540.40 - this two contracts so now I have already
543.88 - bought the 5,300 puts or at least place
545.96 - the order to buy the 5300 puts sold one
548.76 - of the 5200 puts now I'm going to sell
551.40 - another spread I'm going to sell the
553.48 - 5250 puts one time that's how we get 1
556.40 - by two that would be just a classic
558.56 - ratio spread I said we go twice the
561.20 - width we went $50 wide here so we're
564.24 - going to go down to $100 wide so you
567.56 - normally would buy the 50 150 and these
570.68 - spreads usually trade with this amount
572.44 - of time around
574.00 - $3.15 $3 uh in that range I'm going to
577.40 - take on a little bit more risk here I'm
580.68 - going to go another and you'll notice
582.32 - here that the buying power is 46 $
585.88 - 44700 this pop is 89% this state of
589.60 - decay is
590.92 - $436 omnidirectional slightly bullish
594.24 - one long Delta Max profit $5,350
600.40 - $535 why because you're selling this
602.88 - spread for
604.24 - $35 if the stock were to close again
607.36 - cash settled there is no um uh uh stock
611.96 - involved here so it's all cash settled
614.48 - so you don't have to come up with the
615.68 - money at expiration if the stock were to
617.84 - close under 5250 or right at 5250 you
621.44 - don't have to worry about whether you're
622.52 - going to be exercise or signed there is
624.40 - none of that this is all cash settled
626.52 - but this spread that you're long would
628.44 - be worth $5
629.88 - ,000 plus the
632.68 - $35 that you might have sold this for
635.84 - like I just said I'm going to take on a
637.68 - little bit more risk so I'm going to
639.60 - move this
641.16 - 5150 put down another $50 to
648.64 - 5,100 what is that going to do that's
651.00 - going to increase my credit that I
653.28 - received from around $310 15 or
657.24 - $35 increase it by another $3 to
662.04 - $620 full disclosure on this trade it
665.44 - has about an 89 uh percent pop it's $8
669.84 - of th in Theta Decay this would be a way
672.80 - to keep your your contract size the same
676.60 - but in not increase your units but
679.56 - increase your risk by buying power the
682.56 - buying power obviously goes up to
685.44 - $9,300 that's is a large trade for
688.56 - anybody's account my own account
690.40 - included so you have to watch your size
692.80 - if $10,000 or just under is too much
695.48 - buying power for you then I would go
697.36 - down to the one that I previously showed
699.32 - you with using the 5150 put if you want
702.44 - some money to have at risk if you're a
705.00 - little bit more bullish than what the
706.44 - market is showing you here today then
708.80 - maybe this is a spread that you would
711.00 - like to put on again I'm putting this on
713.80 - right here full disclosure as I said
715.80 - just a moment ago if you go to the
717.84 - follow page you can notice that you can
719.96 - do this spread significantly better than
722.12 - me I'll put up my SPX here for you just
725.20 - so you can see I get to see I think you
726.76 - get to see about a month of these trades
728.96 - or the 30 past trades uh that I've done
732.04 - in in SPX it's one or the other I think
735.44 - it's the last month or month and a half
737.68 - of trades or the last uh 30 trades or
740.76 - something like that but anyway you can
741.80 - see what I did here look how fast this
743.84 - spread moves cuz I did it at
746.52 - 9:33 when SPX uh was Trad at
750.84 - 5738 it had an ivy rank of 34 look at
754.24 - what's happened to The Ivy rank it's
755.76 - expanded even more which means this
758.00 - spread is going to trade even fatter for
759.64 - you I got filled at 590 and 605 even
763.76 - though the spread even though SP SPX
765.40 - only moved $2 this move by 15 that's a
769.28 - product of volatility expanding and
771.56 - volatility expanding right now maybe you
773.48 - want to wait on this trade and see if
774.72 - volatility collapses a little bit 91%
778.12 - pop when I put the trade on you'll
780.40 - notice that that probability profit has
782.24 - changed to 89 look at this it's up at
784.80 - 650 I have an order in at 645 to sell it
788.56 - uh again so we'll see if we have that uh
791.20 - if I get filled I will definitely uh
793.04 - post that for you after this podcast
795.56 - again I did about half my size that I
798.52 - normally do so for you Traders out there
801.24 - if you're only a one lot Trader in SPX
803.92 - maybe this is not the spread for you
805.80 - maybe you should go back down to that
808.08 - you know risk uh two to make one kind of
811.32 - trade if you have more buying power or
813.72 - maybe you have uh uh you've been rolling
815.88 - down a lot of calls like if you notice
818.12 - uh for me in my
821.24 - portfolio I'm reducing Delta all over
824.56 - the place in all of my trades uh in
827.00 - Apple today which I had a little bit of
828.92 - uh short Delta in I rolled down my calls
831.68 - to keep my short Delta in apple a
833.84 - Goldman Sachs that was a trade that we
835.36 - just put on uh in this podcast I believe
837.68 - on Tuesday I rolled down my calls to
840.12 - keep my Deltas uh in line Microsoft uh I
844.28 - rolled uh that that that was the um
846.52 - spread that we just did I showed you
848.32 - little to no volatility change after
850.52 - earnings so I'm doing a post earnings uh
854.08 - $15 wide iron Condor again you can see
857.52 - these trades before you even get the
859.80 - podcast um if you have a tasty trade
862.40 - account and look at the follow page
864.36 - those are my two SPX trades I just did I
866.92 - showed you wings are Bid I did half my
869.48 - normal size omnidirectional slightly
872.60 - bullish trade in SPX and then TSM um I'm
877.20 - rolling down the untested uh untested
880.28 - side mu I'm rolling down the untested
883.20 - side why am I telling you this or
884.84 - showing you all this because I'm losing
887.56 - my long Deltas in these other products
890.72 - by rolling down the untested side and
893.56 - replacing that with the SPX trade that
896.80 - does have long Delta remember SPX is 10
900.04 - times the size of spy so it's a very big
904.04 - product be careful out there ladies and
906.16 - gentlemen and don't scare yourself with
907.92 - these trades but I know one thing that
909.24 - won't scare you is to bring your account
911.36 - to tasty trade open Move transfer your
913.88 - account to tasty trade the number one
916.68 - trading platform in the whole
919.80 - universe even on Halloween
