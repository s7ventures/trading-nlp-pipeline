0.04 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.20 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
3.84 - you today what's the date it's October
7.00 - 22nd 2024 and I'm right here in the
10.40 - Batcave right here in downtown Chicago
14.04 - but first as I always do let's take a
15.76 - quick look at what's going on the market
17.52 - even the S&P is down 15 handles meaning
20.08 - 15 points
21.92 - $15.75 they're about mid-range for the
24.44 - day as you can see here from the high
25.96 - low basically unchanged down around a
28.20 - quar perc Nasdaq doing the same uh
31.48 - Russell also doing the same maybe a
33.36 - little weaker or the weakest of the
34.68 - group that's kind of been the way things
36.48 - have been going the last couple of days
38.32 - as you can see here the Russell selling
39.80 - off a little bit as the rest of the
41.56 - market have been catching a little bit
42.80 - of a bid over the last couple of days
44.68 - the Dow down 80 volatility up 33 cents
48.24 - that's up almost 2% on a relatively
50.84 - small move to the downside volatility
53.12 - staying bid a little bit here going into
56.08 - the middle of the week bonds traded uh
58.44 - down to 11802 to uh even with interest
61.60 - rates being cut bonds keep going down
63.68 - remember bonds usually have an inverse
65.96 - relationship rates go uh lower bonds go
69.48 - higher but not this case right now I am
71.64 - looking at the 30-year but you could see
73.28 - here the 10year
75.24 - fzn doing exactly the same thing but
77.76 - I've got a little bit of a different uh
80.04 - conversation or talk to have today um
83.48 - I've got a lot of emails about you know
85.92 - cost of capital and do you ever look at
87.68 - buying power um to take a look at at
90.12 - that so I'm going to do two things here
91.84 - well first let's go to the uh High
94.28 - option volume list and I'll put in the
97.00 - two stocks that I want to look at just
98.52 - to save a little bit of time Goldman
100.80 - Sachs is one I'm going to go by symbols
102.84 - here and just put it in alphabetical
105.20 - order for you here uh Goldman Sachs
107.80 - let's take a look at it just on on paper
110.44 - here uh from the high option volume List
113.28 - $519 stock relatively high price stock
117.00 - uh $500 stock is going to use a lot of
119.12 - buying power so that's going to be a
120.56 - knock against it it's up around $1.74
123.24 - today it's had a relatively uh average
126.24 - size move about $5 today the ivx 5day
130.24 - change very important number for me I
131.76 - like to see that number green it's
133.68 - slightly red over the last 5 days this
136.24 - is volatility over the last 5 days The
138.56 - Ivy rank of 37 is good and no earnings
142.64 - looming now I'm going to compare the
144.56 - same strategy in this $500 stock with JP
149.20 - Morgan
150.64 - JP Morgan I have right down here at the
153.00 - bottom of the screen uh half the amount
155.68 - of uh buying power would be needed uh
158.88 - because a $224 stock versus a $500 stock
162.20 - up today also just like Goldman Sachs
164.84 - relatively average size move around $2
168.20 - it's down the same amount of ivx 5day
171.28 - change just under half a percentage
173.68 - point and its IV rank is actually
176.40 - slightly higher at 38 versus gold sacks
180.56 - which we had up here is 37 and change
183.40 - but I think we can all say that for
185.92 - friends and we're all friends here the
187.84 - ivy rank is exactly the same the ivx
190.40 - 5day change is exactly the same the
192.64 - relative move for the day is about the
194.68 - same and the price is two times as much
198.64 - just rounding here JP Morgan versus
202.12 - Goldman Sachs they're both in the same
203.68 - type of Industry let's look at the
206.12 - buying power relationship between two
209.32 - similar type trades I'll stay in JP
211.60 - Morgan I'm going to go to December
214.24 - earnings aren't until January you'll
216.60 - notice here that I have the volume
218.16 - volume's good not great uh although the
221.04 - markets are quite tight this is just the
223.88 - uh volume for the day let's look at the
225.56 - open interest here uh open interest
228.24 - thousands of contracts on either side so
230.24 - this checks all the box as a tight
233.08 - liquid Market meaning the bid ask
235.40 - between the strikes relatively tight and
237.40 - liquid plenty of of volume volum here to
241.20 - Warrant a trade not the volume that you
242.92 - need volume but you want to be a you
244.64 - don't want to be the only one playing in
245.72 - the sandbox so what am I going to look
247.00 - at JP Morgan let's just look at around a
249.92 - 20ish Delta strangle on both sides I'm
253.64 - going to go to the
255.24 - 210 on the puts I'm going to go to the
257.72 - 240s on the calls basically delta
260.88 - neutral 55 uh Deltas here a pop of
265.12 - 65% the Theta decay $970
269.88 - without volatility moving one way or the
271.64 - other uh your max profit obviously what
274.16 - you're selling it for
276.68 - $494 uh your max loss they say is
279.16 - unlimited I Define it by the amount of
281.52 - buying power that you have here so
283.04 - you're getting paid around or your max
285.12 - profit can be around
286.72 - $495 depending on where you get filled
289.28 - uh on the $3,000 or $3,100 in buying
292.64 - power $
294.28 - 65% pop on the overall trade I like to
297.72 - have trades that are over 65% 5 or more
300.80 - around that uh standard deviation or
304.56 - that dotted line that we're looking at
306.88 - here uh on the uh tasty trade platform
312.12 - okay that's JP Morgan put those numbers
314.40 - in your head or write them down so you
316.00 - have them here uh going to be a little
317.76 - test after this not really but you know
320.04 - there's going to be a little bit of a
321.32 - test let's look at Goldman Sachs now
324.68 - Goldman Sachs a much higher price stock
326.96 - we're going to go to December it has
328.52 - earnings to in January uh look at the
331.84 - open interest not quite as strong uh
335.08 - open interest as we had in JP Morgan so
338.08 - maybe a tad uh the needle moving to
341.04 - maybe a JP Morgan trade right here let's
343.40 - go to the 20ish Delta I'll go to the 480
348.40 - puts that's a 20ish Delta uh plenty of
351.28 - volume in in that line decent markets
354.04 - for a $500 uh stock and I'll go to the
358.16 - 560 calls which is around a 20ish Delta
362.12 - here and let's take a look at the
364.12 - numbers on top 67 pop versus a 65% pop a
368.20 - Theta Decay 25 uh much higher than what
372.60 - you had in JP Morgan but obviously
374.96 - because a higher price stock um Delta
377.48 - basically delta neutral just like the JP
379.68 - Morgan
381.24 - $1,255 That's the mid price that's what
383.44 - you would be uh selling this for and the
386.04 - buying power effect is
388.04 - $6,500 versus $3,100 so the buying power
391.36 - effect is twice as great as what we had
396.36 - in JP Morgan but the credit we received
400.20 - is more than twice as much that we had
404.16 - in uh JP Morgan remember JP Morgan the
407.48 - it was closer to 4 $494
410.56 - $490 here you've got $1250
414.76 - $1,255 um remember it was twice as much
417.44 - it be $10 so on a relative basis all
421.00 - things being the same your probably
423.68 - profit being the same uh your buying
426.40 - power being twice as much or a little
428.72 - bit more than twice as much but yet you
430.84 - get compensated by the extra um credit
435.40 - that you received that makes Goldman
438.04 - Sachs my choice or my trade for today so
441.96 - I'm going to look to sell the strangle
444.16 - uh you'll be able to see it on a follow
445.64 - page in just a moment I'm going to sell
447.56 - the 480 560 I'm going to try to collect
450.76 - around
451.64 - $12.55 which would be the mid price on
454.32 - this trade you will see it on the follow
