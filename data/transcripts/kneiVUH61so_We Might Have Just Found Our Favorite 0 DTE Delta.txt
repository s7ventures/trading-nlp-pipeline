0.04 - profit targets by Delta for zero GT part
2.16 - of our zero GT discussion let's see what
3.96 - we got is this going to be complicated
5.56 - cuz I'm a little tired from yesterday
6.76 - Russell down three it's really
8.92 - complicated managing winners is the
10.56 - Cornerstone of tasty methodology by
12.40 - taking profits aggressively we ensure a
15.52 - high percentage of updates when the
17.40 - trades are going well using a higher
20.88 - profit Target will bring home more of it
23.52 - but Som days things turn against you
26.40 - right mhm okay what we have what have
30.20 - been the best performing profit targets
33.04 - for short zero DT premium and has it
36.84 - depended on the distance out of the
38.36 - money you want to take a
45.64 - guess I'm um I'm hoping it's in the
49.64 - 20ish Delta range it's probably going to
52.16 - be closer to the 35ish Delta range
54.88 - that's my guess if that's you're hoping
57.44 - it's in the 20ish Delta range
60.68 - with my short strike I think they're
62.20 - only doing strangles here right because
63.60 - they're not buying the wings is that
65.72 - correct they um they're not doing buy
68.28 - there's no wings right yeah let's take a
69.84 - look and see if Tony is correct using 21
72.72 - months worth of data now we examine
75.04 - selling strangles every day at the
76.36 - market open and with a variety of Delta
79.48 - ranging from 50 to 15 for each Delta we
82.48 - considered the long-term performance of
84.16 - the hypothetical traders who manage the
85.76 - trades at different fixed percentages of
87.32 - the initial credit so the question
89.40 - becomes if you manage it 15% or 50% of
92.76 - the initial credit where do you do
94.68 - better it's a little confusing because
96.88 - what happens here and you're going to
98.00 - see this starting on the next slide is I
100.24 - think it's going be a higher Delta than
101.44 - I'm that I'm gonna like that's my that's
103.92 - going to be my call what's going to
106.36 - happen okay just hear me out of this is
109.80 - the higher the Delta the strangle like a
112.28 - straddle or a high Delta strangle yeah
114.28 - the quicker you have to manage yeah or
116.56 - you're dead Okay okay I think you're
118.92 - going to get that opportunity
120.40 - if you get wider then you can wait a
122.00 - little bit longer but if you do it if
124.12 - you don't do it quick in a stra that
126.00 - makes sense okay least makes sense to me
128.80 - this is the cumulative performance of
132.20 - the 50
134.80 - Delta um straddles MH okay Cuma of
139.24 - performance 50 Delta straddles so what's
142.52 - happening here is if you look at the Top
144.76 - Line that's in blue it's hard to see but
147.08 - if you look at the Top Line That's
148.32 - profit Target of 15% 15% 15% blows away
151.84 - everything else sure if you waited until
154.64 - 35 or 50% profits you don't do that well
159.08 - yeah you can see that's the that's that
161.52 - um reddish line down at the bottom
163.84 - that's followed by that purple line yeah
165.88 - that's the 35 and 50% uh Target the 25%
170.76 - is the yellow line um yep that seems to
173.56 - do okay too I mean it's in sign profits
178.44 - on the left hand side right 3 $1 or
180.64 - whatever yeah yeah yeah yep you do
184.12 - significantly better significantly yeah
188.56 - when you um manage early on a big Delta
191.60 - strangle or straddle in this case let's
193.72 - go to the next slide Beth so the next
195.92 - one is going to be 40 and what happens
198.08 - at 40 is you can go up a little bit now
199.72 - you can go to 25% and you kind of have
202.44 - you know you're okay look at look at
204.00 - that straddle you're a you're a loss uh
207.16 - yep if you wait if you wait yeah this is
209.96 - a 40 Delta we're only showing this
212.28 - because this is such a cool way to
216.20 - premium working for you yeah go to the
218.64 - next slide Beth so this one is the 30
221.48 - Delta and in the 30 Delta it's also 25%
224.68 - so if you if you sell a straddle like
226.64 - you sell both at the money options in
228.16 - the zero days you got to manag in 15% if
230.92 - you move a little bit further out of the
232.04 - money like 40 and 30 Deltas we're
234.00 - usually at 20 if you move 40 or 30 then
236.92 - you can do it maybe wait till 25% 15 25%
240.44 - go to the next slide because this is
241.72 - where we are at we're at the 20% number
244.36 - at the 20% number okay which is the one
247.68 - we sell you can wait until you get 15%
250.80 - you see that yeah I do okay yeah I do so
253.48 - you I'm sorry you can wait till get 35%
255.24 - 35% and so so this is the 35% number so
259.28 - it's just it as you get price target of
261.20 - 50% not so great sou enough if you as
263.76 - you get further out of the money you can
265.96 - you can go to a higher percentage mhm
268.44 - okay and um battle not doing well at all
271.20 - let's go to next slide Beth the next
272.48 - one's going to be 15 and at 15 it's
274.68 - still the same thing it's 35% mhm so
277.88 - what the research team wanted to show
279.24 - you was that if you sell something out
281.92 - the money you got to manage really early
283.88 - if you if you sell something further out
285.36 - of the money you can give yourself a
286.56 - little cush yes yes and you could hold
289.00 - out for a little bit more I did a I did
291.56 - I did a guest podcast the other day for
293.20 - somebody that was doing zero DTS and he
295.36 - asked a question just like this and we
298.48 - hadn't finished this study yet
300.28 - but because this is a brand new study
301.68 - but it that's really interesting and um
306.80 - anyway super interesting study that that
310.16 - as you get further out of the money you
311.48 - can go from 15 to 35% in expected
314.44 - profits have the same kind of targets
316.88 - and and by the way you can do 25% across
318.60 - the board you're great yeah it seems
320.60 - well the closer to the to the money the
323.32 - zero TTS were traded the more important
325.80 - it was to take profits quickly for
327.28 - straddles 15% profit Target was the most
329.72 - successful while the more typical was a
332.00 - 25% range that's what I just said the
334.72 - further out of the money at the 20 Delta
336.96 - 15 Delta 35% profit did best but and 15
341.36 - did even worse at 50 so just you know
344.04 - that 25 to 35 Perfect The Profit Target
347.44 - management does little for controlling
348.96 - risk the bad losers that never went
351.28 - green hit just as hard but pairing the
354.20 - right strikes and management can set you
356.64 - up for long-term success
