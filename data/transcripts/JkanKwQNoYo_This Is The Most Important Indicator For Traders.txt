0.04 - how to manage trades in IV drops and
4.04 - Peaks would you say this is an IV drop
6.48 - and a peak yeah I would say that's
8.04 - pretty good I would say this is a pretty
9.88 - damn good title for where we are right
11.32 - now in with respect to the markets and
13.08 - things like that let's take a look and
14.52 - see what we got after every IV implied
17.16 - volatility Peak and every IV trough it
20.00 - may be wise to consider adjustments to
22.48 - strategies that were tailored for
25.40 - exceptional IV periods meaning either
27.56 - they were too high or too low on a
29.32 - relative basis around Norms so it's
31.72 - important to note that as shown in our
33.68 - studies implied volatility experiences a
36.56 - significant decline in 2023 and has
40.08 - remained in a similar range in 2024
42.72 - averaging about 15% a date today we're
45.60 - going to focus specifically on managing
47.60 - the Delta of short strangles in
49.24 - different IV environments we're going to
51.12 - look at two different periods 2016 to
53.92 - 2018 and 2020 to 2024 in the 2016 to 18
58.96 - period we had low implied volatility and
61.72 - the vix was averaging around 14 from 20
64.96 - 2020 to 2024 the IV remained High
69.16 - declined with the vix dropping from 40%
71.84 - to 25% and averaging 15% in 2024 so far
77.32 - what we're going to do is we're
78.20 - comparing selling the 25 Delta the 16
80.80 - Delta 25 Delta and 35 Delta strangles 45
83.32 - days to expiration manag at 21 days and
86.12 - we're going to observe the different
87.40 - results in each of these strangles over
89.92 - for each time period just to see hey
92.64 - what happens when volatility is higher
94.20 - and goes lower what happens when
95.84 - volatility is lower and then you know
98.12 - eventually goes higher let's take a look
100.00 - all right so lots of stuff here and sure
103.60 - bear bear with us a little bit the most
105.64 - important thing when you look at this
106.84 - from just the first view is the win rate
109.56 - and the thing that you notice with the
110.72 - win rate is that um and and this is in
114.76 - periods of really low implied volatility
117.28 - so we always talk about in low implied
119.24 - volatility you got to be careful all
121.12 - right the win rate remains super high
123.80 - 75% 73% 72% the average premium you have
127.88 - no context around that so it seems like
129.44 - it's okay but you start to look at the
131.16 - average p&l and you're like okay that
132.96 - doesn't seem like it's that much money
134.52 - for taking that much risk sure and the
137.04 - worst loss is a big multiple of your
140.40 - average gain so when you look at your
142.08 - p&l per trade and then you look at your
143.92 - return on Capital you know you got to be
146.44 - thinking to yourself I'm taking a lot of
148.64 - risk for an 8% return on capital or or a
151.12 - 177% return on Capital in periods of low
154.12 - implied volatility trading was tough in
156.60 - 2016 to 2018 widening your short Delta
160.64 - strikes in low IV environments can lead
162.28 - to higher profits but as you scale up
165.00 - the Delta strikes the average p&l tends
167.36 - to decline both profit and return on
170.28 - Capital decreases because the additional
172.44 - premium that you collect doesn't
174.20 - sufficiently compensate for the
175.72 - increased risk of the position moving
177.48 - against you basically all we're saying
179.08 - is in low impli volatility you got to be
181.16 - careful you got to work really hard Y
183.72 - and the return on Capital at the bottom
185.56 - is something I just want you to just
187.08 - keep in the back of your head right here
188.80 - 178 and 6 now we're going to look at a
191.68 - different time period 2020 to 2024 in
194.84 - this time period you can see that the
196.32 - win rate is virtually the same but you
198.32 - can see the premium that we collect is
200.28 - almost is over double you can see that
202.32 - the worst losses remain the same the
204.32 - buying power per trade actually goes
205.88 - down a little bit but the return on
208.04 - Capital goes from 17 to 41 goes from
211.20 - like 8 to 48 and from 6 to 51% the
217.32 - difference between low implied
219.76 - volatility and high implied volatility
222.00 - is the difference between survival and
224.16 - wealth creation you see these numbers
225.96 - here yeah I'm looking at right now 41%
228.68 - return on Capital 4851 now you're
230.80 - talking to me baby go back one slide
232.88 - John for a second here's the return on
234.76 - Capital in a in a 2-year low implied
236.68 - volatility period if you did everything
238.20 - right 178 and six then you fast forward
241.92 - one slide and you're at 41 you know
244.32 - you're at 41 48 51 everything changes
248.00 - with respect to you know higher implied
250.20 - volatility you could sell bigger Delta
251.72 - strangle you can make you know you can
253.12 - actually make some money your win rate
254.80 - didn't change either which is nice so
256.80 - now the win rate doesn't change at all
258.08 - in periods of high INF flight volatility
259.88 - pnl and return on Capital are higher
262.00 - across the board however scaling Delta
264.40 - strikes both the 25 and 35 has resulted
266.72 - in a significant increase in the average
269.12 - premium collection Ed compared to
270.68 - sticking with the 16 Delta strikes
272.64 - leading to a better overall performance
274.92 - basically saying that when there's more
276.52 - opportunity take more risk to summarize
278.56 - in one sentence higher a heightened
281.44 - implied volatility conditions Elevate
283.24 - the average profitability of all
285.72 - strangles particularly those with higher
287.68 - Delta values again higher opportunity
290.40 - take more risk one contributing factor
292.56 - is that as implied volatility Rises it
296.12 - commonly results in more expensive
298.04 - option premiums faster time to an
299.88 - increased premium for options with
301.28 - higher Delta values which is correct
303.28 - across the board that's exactly what
304.96 - happens hard to do the numbers are they
307.88 - speak for themselves let's go to next
309.24 - slide so some of the takeaways here
311.28 - adjusting your Deltas of your short
312.64 - premium position response to changes
314.24 - implied volatility whether it rises or
316.52 - Falls can contribute to stabilizing a
318.96 - portfolio's risk risk exposure this is
322.00 - because alterations in implied
324.80 - volatility impact the risk and return um
327.76 - of all deltas and boosting the Delta of
330.20 - a strangle can be profitable when
332.56 - there's High implied volatility but
334.20 - lower IV environments lead to less lead
337.28 - to less outcomes when less good outcomes
340.64 - when trading higher Delta strangles
343.76 - meaning that the returns in low implied
346.08 - volatility when you when you trade the
347.88 - 25 and 35 Delta strangles not very good
350.72 - when you in high implied volatility
352.28 - great that's the whole difference very
354.40 - nice you want to know something that was
355.72 - so short so sweet so compact so to the
358.36 - point really made a really nice takeaway
361.16 - there but you know somebody else is
362.64 - going to give you a nice takeaway SA
