0.08 - I looked at it like a trade and you took
1.92 - all the money you guys had I just saw
3.72 - the opportunity risky play that's risk
5.68 - let's go to favorite strategies my
7.32 - biggest strategies my favorite strategy
8.80 - would be the your grinder mhm over the
11.16 - last four or five years he's been able
13.20 - to generate returns between 10 and 20%
16.36 - yeah well somebody's selling a catering
17.88 - business you know nothing about cater
19.64 - nothing about it and you're like my
22.40 - wife's a good
25.07 - [Music]
28.00 - cook all right welcome everybody welcome
30.52 - back to another Rising Star segment
33.48 - looking forward to this Gary how are you
35.76 - good how are you excited for you to be
37.40 - here today because your story is a
40.96 - little different than most um first of
44.60 - all you've been trading since you were I
46.96 - got I got to set the background for a
48.48 - second you've been trading since since
51.12 - your early 20s early 20s yeah and you're
53.96 - 39 now so it's been basically since 2007
57.00 - 2008 in their somewhere in there yes and
59.24 - and you're for untasty yeah essentially
63.36 - yeah since we started yeah okay I I like
66.36 - that cuz you got the whole you know all
68.16 - the players you know everybody y okay
70.68 - got it so we like it's weird walking
72.68 - around here seeing everybody because
74.08 - like we like lifers it's good yeah it's
76.32 - like I know him he knows all the
78.52 - terminology knows all the players yeah
81.20 - um let's talk about
84.92 - just I think you told me that your dadad
88.48 - kind of got you into Trading yeah
90.32 - originally because he was trading some
93.56 - kind
94.28 - of I I honestly don't he got into yeah
98.16 - but he got into the Futures and we got
100.32 - into doing spreads and uh like cattle
102.80 - and Hogs and corn but he's not a farmer
104.88 - so he's not a farmer no but he got into
107.32 - catle because he had friends that are
109.68 - farmers you know he did so yeah maybe
111.84 - that maybe that's why he got into it but
113.84 - uh yeah yeah so I I mean it makes sense
117.36 - for somebody is does he live in Iowa yes
119.56 - makes sense for people in Iowa to get
121.16 - into Trader cattle and Hogs but uh um
124.44 - you look at them every day driving
125.68 - around yeah yeah so what' you do in
129.40 - what' you do in there like your first
130.72 - trade do you remember so we get into
134.00 - spreads and so we would do like five
136.76 - cattle and one month you know it's and
139.56 - you you buy one month and you sell
141.12 - another month you you're calendar rizing
143.08 - calendar spreads live cattle live cattle
145.56 - oh my God clean hogs and uh yep my first
148.36 - trade I lost 250 bucks I remember as in
150.88 - live cattle and uh it was a calendar
153.36 - spread it was a calendar spread yeah and
155.16 - you say this this sucks yeah as it is
157.60 - going to takes practice you know you go
159.88 - in thinking oh I'm going to be a
160.84 - millionaire of training Commodities you
162.80 - and then yeah it's not that easy it's
164.12 - not that easy yeah yeah you learn that
166.12 - very quick yeah um and your background
169.12 - educational your backgrounds in let's
171.36 - call it uh mechanical engineering
174.88 - manufacturing engineering manufacturing
176.64 - yeah what we loved about your story
179.96 - and I think that's the most important
181.56 - thing you know to to tell from from our
184.12 - perspective to Tasty um is
187.32 - that your your trading you know from
190.32 - early 20s which is exactly when I
192.56 - started trading everything
195.08 - else gave you probably a different
198.48 - perspective on business and on risk and
202.00 - that led you to make certain decisions
203.80 - in your life that you might not have
206.28 - made had you not been trading I me we
208.88 - never really know but my guess is you
211.64 - know you wouldn't have
214.04 - left um a cozy steady job to take a risk
217.96 - at starting your own business if you
220.00 - hadn't been comfortable taking risk
222.36 - right well I always wanted to do
225.16 - something you know so on my background I
227.12 - was thinking I want to start a machine
228.44 - shop run my own machine shop right and
231.68 - the opportunity came up to purchase this
233.44 - catering business that this gentleman
235.28 - was selling he was retiring and you know
238.00 - I was not a cook I was not a chef I
239.96 - didn't have any background in that at
241.16 - all but it just you know from my
244.00 - perspective I looked at it like a trade
245.84 - it was just like I just saw the
247.20 - opportunity it was just so somebody's
248.96 - selling a catering business you know
250.44 - nothing about cater open about it and
252.68 - you're like my wife's a good cook that's
256.20 - all you had that's all I had I I
258.48 - believed in my wife 100% she could run
260.64 - this thing you know with her eyes closed
262.56 - did she want to do it oh yeah yeah she
264.52 - was yeah so right away and she was an
267.20 - analyst somewhere she was an analyst
268.96 - yeah so and she said I'm going to leave
270.60 - my job you're going to leave your job
272.12 - we're going to roll the dice no kids at
274.40 - this point kids at this okay and you're
276.40 - like we're going to roll the dice and
278.36 - see what happens yep yep and you took
280.92 - all the money you guys had and basically
283.56 - yeah okay that's the catering that's a
286.36 - risky play that's risk yeah yeah the
288.80 - numbers made sense you know like I said
290.28 - I looked at it like a trade and I was
291.52 - like yeah just you don't know anything
292.52 - about catering you know nothing about
293.80 - caring but it's really hard business
296.40 - it's hard physically it's yeah and the
298.36 - funniest thing was we were talking
299.96 - before the segment you said to me I said
302.12 - well like what do you do and you go you
303.96 - go I clean a lot of dishes I wash a lot
305.72 - of
306.68 - dishes you come full circle from
309.52 - engineer to Traer to dishwasher yeah
312.36 - promoted from engineering to dishwashing
314.12 - that's right that's right and and he
316.00 - said you you were surprised what I loved
318.44 - is you said I'm surprised how much tasty
321.44 - I wash while watch while I'm washing
323.72 - dishes and now I trade when I'm watching
326.24 - dishes listen listen you are the first
328.76 - uh dishwasher yeah listening to Liz and
330.24 - Jenny washing dishes I love it um so so
335.24 - you start trading in
337.16 - 200 uh 7 2008 and obviously you know
340.20 - you're starting out of your business
341.80 - career but you've you've pretty much
343.56 - traded
345.32 - consistently for the last 15 years there
348.76 - 16 years I took a little break going to
350.44 - school yeah I took a little break but
352.28 - then I got back into it right after
354.04 - we're going to focus on your trading for
355.72 - the last five or six years we're going
357.80 - to focus on you know how how you manage
361.64 - your trading because you trade every day
363.88 - and we're going to focus on how you
364.96 - manage your trading with running yourit
367.60 - own business and how your trading gives
369.76 - you the confidence you know to kind of
371.84 - grow your own business and and build
373.56 - that up and at the same time you're able
375.52 - to manage your family your your
378.76 - positions watch the
381.20 - network solicit new clients you know
384.60 - maintain all these I mean cater business
386.56 - you guys run a small business yeah so
388.40 - you're doing you're doing sales and
389.92 - marketing well yeah yeah yeah between
393.16 - the business and a 5-year-old we stay
394.80 - busy yeah you trade multiple accounts
397.32 - but let's call it mostly your IRA
399.48 - account and let's call it you know
401.28 - approximately six figure IRA account
403.64 - okay that's it we're just going to leave
404.76 - it there which is a very fair
406.72 - representation of what you have and
408.80 - we're going to say the most impressive
410.64 - thing about Gary is that over the last
415.20 - four or five years he's been able to
416.96 - generate returns that are um
420.32 - while all this is going on of two three
423.76 - or four times risk-free rates so risk-
426.52 - free rates could be anywhere between you
428.04 - know four and 5% so two three and four
430.72 - times risk-free rates so somewhere
432.60 - between let's call it 10 and 20% in that
435.20 - range okay every single year
437.28 - consistently and to us that is exact and
441.16 - it's a little bit harder in IRA account
442.76 - because it's less Capital efficient and
444.64 - to us that is exactly the definition of
447.52 - what we're looking for for people um um
451.20 - consistency no like one hit wonders yeah
454.72 - um just consistency and uh people that
457.88 - are active MH and one of the things you
460.00 - mentioned me which was interesting you
461.24 - said you know um your wife has a like an
466.60 - old 401k from her last job and that
470.00 - drives you crazy it's like it's it's a
472.68 - you know it's a choice of mutual funds
474.32 - or whatever it is yep so it's one of
476.00 - those targeted uh targeted date you know
479.68 - thoughts and bonds yeah it changes over
481.16 - time yeah yeah it drives me nuts drives
482.84 - me nuts too yeah so let's talk about
485.28 - favorite strategies my favorite
486.96 - strategies would be like in my IRA my
490.04 - biggest my biggest strategies my
491.44 - favorite strategy would be the cupboard
492.76 - call so it's it's my biggest position
495.76 - right now I'm in the Russell and that's
497.56 - my biggest position so are you mostly
499.04 - doing like cover calls and stuff against
501.68 - in index and indexes and ETFs against
505.40 - individual stocks against I I usually
507.20 - stick with the ETFs yeah with the big
508.92 - positions like you prefer ETFs but you
511.64 - also trade you're you trade Commodities
514.28 - too yeah any any you know like just
517.28 - yesterday uh toward the end of the day I
519.60 - put a little position on Silver that was
521.60 - an ETF though but but I have traded
523.44 - silver as well the Futures but anywhere
524.96 - I see an opportunity yeah you Bas the
528.56 - definition of an opportunity you is what
530.96 - like like what what would generate a
533.32 - trade you know idea to you I I'm just
536.40 - looking at like a price extreme in
538.44 - that's what I do you know so you know
539.76 - that's that's what I do well yeah no
541.32 - surprise I watch you day so uh feel like
543.88 - we looked at bonds and you know I just
545.48 - thought Bonds were oversold but yields
547.08 - were too so I got a little I got a
548.72 - little long bonds you know right and
550.40 - same thing with silver and you're able
552.64 - to able to keep keep your size in check
555.08 - yes so when I'm when I'm doing these
556.76 - other trades I'm usually doing like the
558.52 - zebra or I do a p man's cover call or
560.88 - like a p man's cover put or something
562.28 - like that or vertical are you usually
564.52 - leaning a little bit long as or or it
567.24 - doesn't matter to it doesn't really
568.52 - matter like right now I'm short um I
571.44 - tend to be more long I guess than
573.56 - anything but um with the smaller trades
575.88 - I'm it's all over the Bap sometimes I'm
578.16 - long short neutral as you become more
580.60 - successful and become more active how's
583.20 - your training changed I would say it's
585.72 - it's definitely gotten um less
589.56 - emotional and it's gotten more
591.96 - mechanical
593.48 - so uh I have the mechanics like in the
596.64 - cupboard calls I'm I just really focus
598.76 - on the call and I'm rolling when I'm
600.96 - taking profits I'm rolling it down or
602.44 - rolling it up up up and out um whereas
605.64 - when I first started out you know I put
607.20 - a position on and as soon as it was down
608.92 - a little bit I I take it off you know
610.60 - right it far more emotional but but I
613.72 - kept all my positions doing like iron
615.12 - condors and verticals you know I kept
616.80 - everything real small sry how aggressive
619.32 - are you with existing positions like
622.88 - making adjustments or whatever it is um
626.08 - I look for the 50% so like if I'm in
628.72 - let's say if I'm Russell and it's going
630.24 - down bu up close to 50% and that call
632.72 - I'll roll that call down um sometimes
635.92 - though it just depends like if I put a
637.28 - position on and the next day it's up 20%
640.16 - I might it might just I might take you
641.92 - off take a profit yeah how many
643.28 - positions do you think you carry at at
645.28 - any one time four 3 four five somewhere
649.08 - in there 3 four five yeah so relativ
651.44 - that's between my IRA and then my
653.36 - personal account you know my smaller
654.92 - Tasty Bites yeah smaller account yeah
657.32 - and how much of your capital do you
660.80 - use uh I'm using them quite a bit in my
663.44 - IRA cuz I I buy the shares so and I know
667.28 - that's not the most efficient way of
668.48 - doing it but uh well in Ira it doesn't
671.00 - really matter whether you sell the put
672.12 - or buy the ships it's the same thing
673.64 - yeah right yeah but I mean you could do
675.52 - I can I could go in there and load up
676.80 - like zebras or something you know yeah
678.36 - you could pursue Futures and do that but
680.48 - but I like owning the shares in that in
682.68 - that account so like do you get mad at
685.80 - yourself when you lose oh yeah you do
688.64 - okay good yeah good do you know anybody
690.44 - else that watch this tasty my dad yeah
693.28 - your dad yeah okay he may have been the
695.04 - one that turned me on to you guys too oh
696.84 - that's all I say he discovered you guys
697.96 - on YouTube or something I don't know but
700.24 - I don't know oh you got you've been with
702.00 - us since the beginning so can't he you
703.32 - that much long that much before that
705.24 - yeah when
707.08 - you put positions on how do you know
710.60 - when to take them
712.04 - off uh that's just the mechanics of to
715.72 - take it off 50% okay so you pretty much
717.88 - stick to that I stick to that um the
720.56 - stock positions by own a stock and it
722.00 - goes against me I just in these ETFs I'm
724.92 - not really worried about it going to
726.12 - zero so I just kind of holds it you know
728.28 - and yeah I just manage I just focus on
730.36 - the co and rolling the call down wait
732.88 - till they ultimately go up yeah I mean
734.84 - if you're long I got 20 something years
736.88 - but I'm assuming in 20 years you know
739.32 - it'll it'll be okay yeah I assume I
742.76 - don't like that I I don't like that
744.28 - approach but I can't I can't think of
745.80 - things like that but yeah do you think
747.96 - that there's
750.28 - in
751.36 - advantage of living in an area where
754.28 - there's like a different kind of uh
757.88 - knowhow with respect to different
759.56 - Commodities like you started off saying
761.56 - like first trade was in cattle and Hogs
764.32 - or something you know but could be corn
766.68 - wheat
767.68 - soybeans I don't think there's really an
769.68 - advantage CU I don't think you know
770.96 - anything but I'm just curious you know
772.96 - it this just it makes you think you're
775.00 - in that belt yeah when you're driving
776.56 - around and you see the corn growing in
778.08 - the in the cattle I guess it just makes
780.76 - you kind of think about the markets
783.12 - where's the stuff going where's it
784.72 - ending up if do you ever
787.16 - think
789.56 - why why don't I just do this fulltime
792.64 - yeah every
794.40 - day like you're watching a dish you're
796.84 - yeah I'm watching dishes and I'm
797.80 - thinking yeah I should just be doing
799.04 - this both time okay I was just curious
800.76 - because because I'm thinking that that's
802.84 - that's how my mind would work and I'm
804.88 - just thinking of that yeah it's a lot
806.28 - easy yeah yeah yeah yeah you don't to
808.32 - get I mean Yeah well yeah you don't have
810.56 - to get up at 3: in the morning to to
813.96 - cook bacon right yeah right the my limit
816.64 - is capital how much you limits Capital
819.08 - yeah what you have right now is um
823.12 - something that's very steady and
825.28 - consistent how do you parlay this
828.56 - into a different form of wealth creation
831.32 - if there's such a thing or you know do
834.48 - you just continue on you know for the
836.88 - next 10 years your GR ER mhm which is
840.88 - there's nothing wrong with that I I
842.36 - spent that's a good way to put it well I
844.12 - spent my my whole career that way just
846.08 - ring it out every year and I'm pretty
848.40 - happy I did yeah you know and I'm just
850.60 - curious if that's the way you think
851.88 - about yourself yeah yeah that's a good
853.96 - way to put it yeah okay I think long
856.00 - term you know eventually we'll probably
857.40 - sell the business you know and retire so
859.92 - I have this the 309 you know yeah good
862.64 - yeah you know me in 30 years yeah yeah
866.36 - caring is a hard business so you know I
868.24 - give it or five years maybe oh yeah no
871.80 - it's yeah and then what and then I just
874.44 - rifled on I guess do you just do you
876.60 - look at your existing positions and go
879.12 - oh I have a position on in XYZ in in ABC
883.24 - D or do I or do you say I have a
885.56 - strategy on in you know a different
887.80 - strategy in ABCD like I'm trying to get
890.28 - an idea of how do you how do you make a
892.08 - decision on like what you're going to do
893.96 - next
894.88 - strategically it comes down
897.80 - to so so like in my IRA I have my core
901.80 - strategy which is going to be the stocks
903.12 - sell the calls so that's going to be the
904.76 - Russell or the S&P you know I was in the
906.44 - S&P for a while and then I moved to
908.04 - Russell um but then the strategy kind of
912.40 - depends on like how big I want to get so
915.68 - I kind of differentiate
918.12 - between uh the core portfolio and that
921.28 - strategy and then the other guys it
924.56 - depends if I'm long or short you know so
926.44 - like I do the zebras trying to trying
929.00 - keep capital and you're trying to
930.20 - reserve as much cash I mean Capital
931.88 - efficiency is really the key to kind of
933.84 - especially in an IRA camp but Capital
935.40 - efficiency is the key to allowing you to
937.48 - do whatever it is yeah it just depends
939.68 - on how bullish I am or bearish you know
941.76 - or like a zebra is a great way to get
943.92 - really long something you yeah mimicking
945.92 - 100 shares yeah sure sure and when you
949.24 - think about that um do you have certain
952.28 - Capital limitations on a per trade basis
955.56 - or is it just what it is what it is it
957.12 - is what it is yeah I'm kind of looking
958.56 - holistic Al at the portfolio I totally
961.24 - understand that that that's the way I
962.32 - would think of it as well yeah
964.72 - um do you have a um do you trade
969.88 - differently in your individual margin
972.20 - account than you do in your IRA account
974.56 - I tend to do more of the the the
976.16 - verticals and zebras than the individual
978.52 - just ver you mean yeah okay yeah I think
980.84 - I do have one stock that I'm it's like a
982.52 - $7 stock that I'm selling calls against
985.32 - in there and my personal individual
987.68 - margin account and then I own some
989.80 - ethereum and and uh what are you gonna
992.28 - do different in 2025 I could probably
994.60 - use Futures more and you know and for
998.28 - instead of being in like the Russell ETF
1000.16 - you know iwm I could probably do the
1001.92 - Futures it's a little more Capital
1004.12 - efficient you could use the the problem
1006.12 - is
1007.48 - that you would have to trade the micro
1011.68 - futures um and then you'd have to write
1014.32 - IW I'm against it so you don't really
1016.04 - save any money it's not it's more
1018.20 - efficient
1019.52 - I think even after it's all said and
1021.36 - done to use the stock okay in in those
1024.00 - cases unless you're using the bigger
1025.76 - contract yeah but then you run the risk
1027.92 - of like notional
1030.36 - inefficiency yeah yeah that's what
1032.96 - scares me a little bit but um are you
1037.04 - doing any kind of exotic spreads at all
1039.24 - or no no everything's covered
1041.32 - everything's yeah no naked right now
1044.52 - okay well I guess I own a little
1046.12 - ethereum so just for fun really a little
1049.20 - little ether yeah I was actually
1051.64 - spreading that off I was I was buying
1053.32 - The Ether and then I was selling the
1054.60 - little little Futures Contract with it
1056.52 - the little micro you know it's real just
1058.04 - playing small it's so tiny but I was
1061.36 - playing around with that are there
1063.80 - certain um ETFs that you think are a
1067.28 - little bit um maybe more customer
1069.84 - friendly to
1071.00 - trade so I liked the Russell because why
1075.92 - it was 200 bucks a share so like in my
1078.40 - case we want to buy the shares that's
1080.20 - far more reasonable than you know spy at
1082.68 - $600 plus it has higher volatility yeah
1084.80 - and it has better volatility get a
1086.48 - little more bank for your buck is that
1087.76 - in the covering call space yeah yep
1089.80 - exactly so that's one that I like yeah
1093.40 - are there any other underlying so that's
1096.04 - one ETF are there anything else that you
1098.08 - think is you know interesting from that
1100.04 - perspective for the ETFs um I'll be in
1102.92 - TLT I'll be in SLV um I was in last year
1107.72 - is is it uh
1109.48 - xlk yeah that's the technology sector
1112.28 - technology that's a tough one it's hard
1114.04 - yeah I was only in it I mean I I timed
1116.24 - it perfect God speed yeah it was a
1118.36 - little luck a little skilled I guess I
1119.84 - don't know a tough one it it moved my
1122.08 - way and I took my money and I was like
1123.44 - yeah I'm done with this cuz you're right
1125.28 - when you've established the position do
1127.44 - you ever add to the
1130.08 - position what are your some of your
1131.72 - discipline SKS so like in my IRA if I
1134.80 - want to own something own shares and I
1137.04 - just want to own it for a while um um
1139.72 - like here in December we had the big
1141.16 - sell off right yeah I was in the Russell
1144.04 - and I made a lot of money on my calls on
1145.76 - that down move so you lost money in the
1148.08 - Russell yeah I losing money in the
1149.20 - Russell but I made a lot of money in the
1150.92 - realized gains of the calls so I took
1152.84 - some of that premium and just bought a
1154.16 - few more shares in the Russell doubl
1156.44 - down a little bit yeah yeah so it's it's
1158.40 - like my way of of uh dollar cost
1161.16 - averaging kind of you know got it I take
1163.16 - what the market gives me you know I take
1165.20 - that money from the call and I can I
1166.48 - could buy a few more shares got it so so
1168.92 - I do have a I do that every once in a
1170.76 - while yeah what would be the advice that
1172.56 - you would give someone that not
1175.44 - necessarily want to open their bu open
1177.44 - their own business because that goes on
1179.04 - saying but what would be the advice you
1182.36 - give to someone who wants to start
1184.56 - trading ultimately to potentially you
1187.32 - know figure out how to open their own
1188.48 - business yeah I would say just start
1190.52 - small just get in there and that's the
1192.48 - way that's the way I had to do it I mean
1194.72 - you can read books till you're blue in
1196.28 - the face you know you can watch tasty
1197.88 - live but until actually get in there and
1200.24 - and start putting the positions on and
1201.88 - how hard was it to for you to how hard
1203.96 - was it for you to translate from what we
1205.64 - talked about in air to actually put it
1207.64 - into practice at first it was difficult
1210.20 - yeah because it was more emotional when
1211.40 - I it started I didn't really know what I
1213.36 - was doing and I I'd put a trade on and
1215.16 - something would happen it' go against me
1216.96 - and I I didn't really understand like
1218.80 - why am I losing money here or something
1220.40 - and and yeah i' close it but but I
1223.00 - stayed real small you know that was that
1225.56 - was the key I think I don't know if
1227.00 - people really understand how important
1229.68 - it is to stay small because it keeps you
1231.16 - in the game until you learn it and then
1232.80 - when you learn it you're like okay thank
1234.88 - God I stayed small yeah I think that's
1236.56 - one thing I I learned uh even before
1239.48 - tasty when I was doing the spreads and
1241.20 - cattle and Hogs and stuff was you know
1243.52 - that was the one thing we did right was
1245.36 - that every position I I did was a spread
1247.44 - and so it was a smaller risk do you know
1250.08 - that I've never traded cattle yeah I
1251.84 - don't think I I you know we have it on a
1254.00 - platform and I mean maybe I traded it
1255.48 - once but I don't think I ever traded
1257.08 - cattle so like I oh uh I don't have any
1260.76 - feel for that I think I've tried lean
1262.80 - Hogs once and I was oh boy I think it
1265.08 - was okay but no I don't remember really
1267.76 - the uh the commissions and fees and
1269.84 - stuff it's the fees from the exchanges
1271.56 - are higher on those guys they're crazy
1273.92 - and the expirations are weird yeah and
1277.08 - there's a lot of weird stuff yeah um so
1279.84 - I kind of stay away from that stuff yeah
1282.00 - and at all
1283.44 - costs I'm going to wrap up with just
1286.24 - asking you if if you do you feel like
1289.96 - at the end of whatever the fiscal year
1291.76 - is the end of the year you know for you
1293.40 - f January 30 U December 31st whatever um
1297.76 - do you look at your
1300.52 - returns yeah like look at your returns
1303.08 - oh this is great I can't wait to oh yeah
1305.08 - I got it all mapped down on a
1306.04 - spreadsheet oh you do oh yeah yeah cuz I
1307.96 - want to know like if you look at the
1309.40 - returns and go okay I got to do a little
1311.00 - better this year I got to do this this
1312.48 - this I have it mapped out like 20 years
1314.44 - of you know 15% return and that's what I
1317.32 - want to make every year you know that's
1319.00 - kind of my goal and so I compare well
1320.84 - that's good that's a good goal to have
1322.64 - yeah see I like what I like about you is
1324.68 - steadiness yeah yeah yeah the
1327.32 - consistency and the steadiness and the
1329.12 - willingness to turn you know trading
1331.24 - into a kind of a motivation to do your
1333.60 - own thing as an entrepreneur I mean
1335.88 - we're you're looking for opportunity you
1338.08 - want to capitalize opportunity for sure
1339.60 - and I think as a Trader it's it's the
1341.04 - exact same thing you know you I look at
1342.96 - opportunity and I'm indiff you know to
1345.64 - what wherever wherever that opportunity
1347.36 - is and I want want to capitalize on
1350.00 - opportunity and uh I think that spilled
1353.04 - over into my life and my business cuz I
1355.56 - wasn't a chef you know I mean you know
1358.44 - if I wasn't trading I probably would
1359.84 - have looked at that opportunity and I
1361.20 - would have said well I'm not a cook I'm
1362.32 - not a chef I don't want to cater I would
1363.72 - have looked at that opportunity I mean
1364.68 - said I'm not a cook I'm not a chef yeah
1366.44 - yeah but I looked at it a little
1367.40 - differently and I said well you know
1368.96 - it's just like if I'm bouncing around
1370.24 - from silver or equities or futures or
1372.96 - crypto it's opportunity opportunity so I
1375.68 - think it was I think it was good
1376.88 - practice Gary thank you so much that was
1379.12 - a great talk that was really interesting
1381.28 - um your story is super cool and
1384.44 - appreciate you sharing it thank you yeah
