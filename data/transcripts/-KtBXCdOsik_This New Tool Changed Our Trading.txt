101.52 - do it that way right yeah I suppose yeah
103.24 - 100% 100% okay great and you can use all
105.52 - those back testing when when you log in
107.12 - the first time you log in you're going
108.12 - to have some compliance speak okay and
110.92 - then you're going to get you you click
112.28 - accept and then you open up to this page
115.40 - okay so the first thing that you're
116.92 - going to do if you want to back test and
118.32 - back testing is just seeing how well
120.36 - a position had worked over time okay or
123.84 - historically had worked over time and so
126.88 - let's click over here and say the the
129.36 - symbol that we want so here I'm going to
131.52 - just say spy now we have about 50 stocks
134.76 - right now have about 50 stocks and we're
137.08 - we're going to come out with about 200
139.04 - in just a matter of just a couple weeks
140.52 - expensive for the data we're providing
142.44 - free right y 50 stocks just based on
145.48 - liquidity yeah some of the most liquid
147.64 - stocks you know the stocks that people
149.64 - were inquiring about the most then you
151.80 - can click down and you can choose the
153.44 - interval okay so what I would do on
156.44 - something like this is I would choose
158.00 - something that's in a relatively short
159.92 - time span okay just you can go all the
162.16 - way back to actually
164.00 - 2013 uh all the way at the bottom you
166.44 - can say all the way to 2013 the data
169.08 - that's available you can also choose
171.00 - different scenarios like you know we got
173.72 - one here energy sector collapse which
175.80 - was 2014 to 2016 uh The post-pandemic
178.84 - Surge 2020 to 2021 you can choose the
183.52 - tech sector Mania of 2020 to 2021 you
186.84 - know so you can choose different scenar
188.84 - that's nice or you can choose like the
191.24 - past and I'm just going to do the past
192.68 - three years then there's some different
194.28 - scenarios that you can choose here some
195.92 - different trades okay so if you want to
197.80 - choose just like I want to back test to
200.00 - see how well a short strangle had worked
202.40 - I'm going to go over here and I'm going
203.28 - to click short strangle then we queue up
205.92 - and we can see now also if if you want
208.20 - to we can just create our own strategy
211.88 - okay we can make adjustments to things
214.20 - so here I'm going to just say 30 Deltas
216.68 - 30 deltas and and this is choosing the
219.28 - strikes based on Deltas okay so this is
222.56 - the same as if you were in the trade
224.08 - platform you go down and you're
225.88 - selecting a strike and you look to see
227.76 - what that Delta was it's just an easy
229.96 - way to select strikes because you know
232.56 - what was a few years ago a $300 stock
235.40 - spy is now all of a sudden a $550 stock
238.20 - so Deltas is how we're choosing then you
240.32 - can choose your expirations now we tend
242.52 - to talk about 45 days till expiration by
245.12 - default it's 45 days but you can choose
247.32 - this and you change if you you can
248.68 - change it to 30 or or whatnot so you
251.08 - have a lot of flexibility here now you
253.20 - have some other options here you have
255.16 - your entry conditions and you have your
257.20 - exit conditions now these are the same
259.44 - this is the same tool that we're using
260.84 - in our our our research studies so
264.48 - you're basically going to be allowed to
266.08 - do what what we've been doing for the
268.56 - past 10 years so here you go entry
271.16 - conditions now you have some options
273.08 - here two two options one is you can
275.32 - either use the exact DTE so let's say
278.76 - right now if you look at spy okay I'm
281.64 - going to look at the options so if
283.44 - you're looking at uh 45 days we actually
285.76 - do have one at 45 days well yesterday we
288.56 - would have had one at 46 days till
291.08 - expiration well it wouldn't have come up
293.04 - with the trade yesterday because we only
294.56 - had one at 46 days till expiration we
296.48 - had another one at 67 days till
297.84 - expiration another one 39 days till
299.24 - expiration so here it would would have
301.40 - waited until today 45 days till
303.60 - expiration so here we just say Okay I
305.48 - want to use exact DT okay we can unclick
308.68 - this and we can get more number of
310.40 - observations how many would be the the
312.76 - maximum it basically would just be doing
314.24 - it every single day oh W so the idea
317.00 - behind that is you're just going to get
318.20 - a a nice distribution of of Trades you
320.88 - can see what was the the best performing
323.00 - the worst performing sure you can also
325.12 - say I want to limit the number of active
327.56 - trades okay so just like you would
329.88 - normally trade here I'm doing a strangle
332.80 - I want to see how well a strangle would
334.80 - have performed or had performed
336.72 - historically over the past three years
338.52 - October 11th 2021 to October um 10th
342.08 - 2024 so just like as of last week okay
345.20 - let's say you know money's unlimited so
347.72 - we're going to only do you know let's
350.04 - say one trade so that means we're only
352.24 - going to have one trade open and then
354.08 - when the next one closes when that trade
356.08 - closes then we'll open up another one
358.00 - okay and we can also just take that off
360.16 - and every 45 days or anytime 45 days is
364.64 - is in the window it would just create a
366.20 - new one okay now we have some exit
368.24 - conditions that we can choose let's just
369.56 - keep keep it all just you know just just
372.36 - uh the default which is nothing is
374.08 - selected okay so here it comes is up
376.92 - it's doing the transaction and it is
379.36 - showing the the the back test so that
382.36 - orange line is the back test the orange
384.72 - line is the p&l the profit and loss for
386.88 - this short strangle strategy here can
389.96 - see again the legs was selling one put
392.24 - at 30 Delta 45 days till expiration
394.48 - selling a call at 30 Delta 45 days till
396.56 - expiration over the past three years
398.28 - okay so this was a profit okay you can
401.04 - see the profit at the bottom now it did
403.60 - three years correct for three years got
405.52 - it okay now we we can also make
407.48 - adjustments to try to improve this and
410.48 - so this is like this is what we consider
412.68 - paper trading but paper trading 2024 not
416.76 - paper trading of 20 years ago you know
419.68 - get your results back instantaneous to
421.44 - see how well a strategy performed over
423.56 - time so here if you look you can see the
425.36 - Buy and Hold strategy it did
427.16 - underperformed the Buy and Hold strategy
428.80 - but yet buying hold strategy would have
430.64 - been holding up that money during the
432.12 - entire time sure sure sure you can see
433.96 - that the average profit and loss can you
435.24 - manage early on this thing absolutely
437.28 - you can see the Max draw down the return
439.56 - on Capital used now if you want to go
441.76 - down and look at the details you can see
443.76 - okay for this we ended up with it wasn't
446.48 - all that great
448.12 - 55% of the trades were profit profitable
451.08 - so we had 18 trades 10 were profitable
453.00 - eight with losses uh you can see the
454.60 - average return per trade you can see the
457.32 - average premium collected over the past
459.44 - three years you can see the premium
461.28 - capture rate that means how much money
462.88 - we tended to keep after everything said
465.68 - and done and this does include the fees
467.20 - and you can see the fees here were
468.88 - $111 okay we can also look at the logs
472.04 - and this is very this is very useful
473.84 - because you can see okay on how were the
476.48 - fees $111 well that that would be the
479.60 - you get $1 of course and then you also
482.04 - have your OCC fees you have your
483.44 - clearing fees you have all those other
485.04 - how many contracts you doing what do we
486.44 - say here did we say number one that
488.92 - would been one and then you have a buy
490.48 - and a sell well that would be just one
492.44 - and then you had two trades so you have
494.44 - the fees over threeyear period yes oh
497.40 - got it okay sorry yeah over yeah over
499.44 - the entire three-year period this is not
501.16 - right right so it's every 45 days minus
503.80 - whatever manager what okay it's all the
506.36 - continual roles absolutely got it okay
508.88 - now if you want to look at what happened
512.28 - okay October 12th 2021 this is the first
515.48 - trade and we closed it out why did we
517.20 - close it out well it was actually
518.80 - exercise so it it looked like it had
520.92 - gone through either the call or the put
522.88 - here and so we got exercise that
524.68 - position this one here expired and it
526.96 - was a it was a profit but the first one
528.68 - was a loss we had some losses here a big
531.40 - loss here of 36% return on on investment
535.32 - and you can just look down and you can
536.52 - see what the fees were the the premiums
538.32 - were then you go over here and we can
540.12 - look at the orders okay so here's
542.68 - another thing that's that's interesting
544.08 - on this we're looking at it on the most
546.32 - liquid part of the day which is at 2:45
549.20 - that is the transaction time so we're
551.28 - not looking at the close we're looking
553.12 - at the bid offer spread and so all these
555.40 - trades would be done at 245 you can see
558.00 - what the the credit was okay the first
560.12 - one we did it at 993 and we took it off
562.68 - for this debit okay and you can look
565.04 - down and you can see all the the orders
567.48 - you can see the transactions too what
569.04 - exactly went on you can also download
571.24 - each one of these pages so if you're
573.28 - kind of a ner you get really granular
574.64 - here you could then you could take that
576.48 - and put it into an Excel spreadsheet if
578.00 - you wanted to absolutely cuz some people
579.48 - have like really particular like what
581.44 - they want to do they want to Overlay it
583.08 - with some technical analysis you want to
585.16 - see when the stock hit your number if
587.04 - you put on this strategy or you want to
589.20 - see if a stock had a you know a 1% move
591.84 - in any one day you can do all that you
593.72 - put on this strategy yeah it's very cool
595.48 - you do all that this shows you the daily
597.64 - settlement so this is just going to show
599.16 - you every single day going back those
602.04 - three years and it's showing you the p&l
604.16 - for each particular day here it's
605.72 - basically just showing okay 4% of the
607.84 - the total has been done and you can see
610.08 - more and you can you can show the
611.92 - Thousand other days within this this
614.44 - this test now let's go back and let's
616.28 - let's just make some modifications to
618.00 - this this particular trade so I went
620.28 - back and I just said uh select go back
622.52 - to the the previous new back test so
624.88 - here we can say let's then exit at 21
628.20 - days till expiration why do you do that
630.60 - well we tended to show that historically
633.24 - once you get close expiration your gamma
635.64 - risk all of a sudden increases your
637.00 - Theta Decay increases significantly but
639.52 - your gamma risk starts increasing so we
641.72 - say it tends to be you know at about 21
644.32 - days till expiration calendar days is
646.60 - when we kind of like to manage as kind
648.12 - of a ballpark we can also say okay let's
650.20 - take profits at a specific premium level
654.40 - we can say let's add a stop loss here or
657.12 - we can also say let's just exit at two
660.12 - days into the trade and we can do that
662.56 - here I'm going to just say 21
664.48 - days profit is it pulling the prices at
667.12 - the end of the day yes at 245 at 245
671.20 - yeah at 245 is when it's it's it's it's
673.96 - assuming that you're exiting these
675.28 - trades so it's not doing this on the
676.64 - close it's doing this at 245 which is
678.40 - the most liquid part of the day so then
679.96 - we can run this back test with those
681.52 - adjustments and we can see how well it
683.52 - did in this particular you know in
685.64 - managing it it looked like it didn't do
687.20 - as well but this is always going to vary
690.04 - based on on what you're doing what your
692.40 - expectations are so if you want to I I
696.08 - thought I saw a feature in there when I
697.28 - was playing around with it that and you
698.88 - may have mentioned it for me if if you
700.72 - did sure where you can close that order
704.16 - and open another one when the when the
706.24 - parameters hit right so if you want to
708.48 - continually have this type of strategy
710.72 - on like let's say you're managing at 25
713.28 - or 35 or 50% or some number date and
716.80 - time and put on another on AB exact
719.56 - moment with new strikes or the same
721.52 - strikes but they would be same Delta but
723.88 - they would be new strikes obviously
725.12 - because time has gone by or go out to a
727.00 - different month is that correct or not
728.36 - 100% so here this is what you do for
730.48 - something like that okay you want to do
732.24 - this set let's just change these uh
733.88 - let's just change this up a little bit
735.04 - let's you can get you can get really
736.24 - crazy in you get a little bit intricate
738.20 - as opposed to just looking at what a
739.52 - strangle is going to do over 45 days
741.92 - absolutely you know if you think that
743.76 - the Russell for example you think the
745.00 - Russell is is going to go off and is
746.92 - just going to have this huge increase in
748.88 - in in things or you think that there's
750.96 - going to be some huge V SP Spike because
753.04 - of things we can get granular in this we
755.04 - can look to see what how a particular
758.56 - strategy performed during your type of
760.84 - Market scenario that you're either
762.72 - expecting and then you can make an
764.44 - assumption okay this is how it performed
766.36 - in the past during during the uh let's
769.12 - say uh during the in in the bare Market
772.28 - okay you can see how well this strategy
774.08 - worked on something like that we don't
776.16 - have yeah yeah yeah we that just doesn't
778.20 - happen at all not allow so here you
780.60 - let's just say I only want to do this
782.64 - every until there's up to five trades
785.04 - and then I don't want to put on anymore
786.32 - because you know money's limited and and
788.32 - that's kind of realistic okay so then
791.00 - you can just run this run this scenario
793.48 - during that environment okay in this
795.56 - strategy it it outperformed a buy and
797.40 - hold you of course you know a Buy and
799.48 - Hold would have lost money during a
800.96 - during a decrease in the overall Market
803.52 - but then there's things that you can do
805.00 - I mean obviously if you think the
806.24 - Market's going to decline you're not
807.84 - going to be selling a strangle you would
810.24 - maybe just sell a call so let's see how
812.60 - well that would work during that type of
814.32 - environment and see how well we can we
816.24 - can make modifications to the the profit
818.40 - and loss and the adjustments of the
820.20 - strategies so you get your almost
822.16 - instantaneous results here this is this
824.08 - is back testing 2024 is this the most
827.24 - trading is this the most advanced back
829.84 - testing platform exists it is I believe
832.52 - the most advanced free back testing
834.96 - application that's on the market right
836.68 - now has to be the newest technology
838.68 - matter what I'd like to think so and
840.28 - it's free it's it's free as long as you
842.56 - have an account you sign up for an
844.28 - account
