0.28 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.40 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
4.04 - you today right here from the Batcave
6.36 - right here from downtown Chicago it's
8.40 - October 17th
11.96 - 2024 but first as I always do let's take
14.32 - a quick look at the market even the S&P
16.64 - is up $10 you can see here that they've
18.96 - had a good range today down to 5871 up
22.56 - to
23.48 - 5927 let's just call them mid-range for
25.88 - the day bulls and bears both having
28.00 - opportunity to make money NASDAQ up 75
31.76 - uh Russell which has been strong the
33.72 - last two weeks sorry last two days
36.08 - taking a breather uh today strong
38.48 - relative to the &ps of NASDAQ taking
41.00 - breather today down 18 leader to the
43.20 - clubhouse to the downside down uh just
45.08 - about three4 of a percentage Point Dow
47.80 - up 105 a public service announcement
51.96 - Dia uh has a dividend that's the Dow uh
55.56 - options if you're a dow uh Trader and
58.04 - you're in November staying mechanical uh
60.32 - let's just call the dividend around
62.12 - 50ish cents that would mean any call
65.40 - that's fairly deep in the money let's
68.20 - say uh around the 374 and lower call I
72.64 - don't think anybody has those calls as
74.76 - you can see here the open interest is
76.08 - very small but anyway you would be in
78.60 - Jeopardy of a dividend now looking at
81.28 - November is one thing looking at October
84.08 - if you're one of those traders that like
85.20 - to trade the zero or one- day options in
88.12 - these smaller products than the SPX
90.32 - meaning the diamonds 5050 C dividend is
92.80 - going to put you in Jeopardy right now
94.80 - of around the
96.32 - 429 calls remember that dividend is 50
99.56 - Cents that means the any option that has
102.44 - a put trading at around or under 50
106.96 - cents is going to make the calls in
110.08 - Jeopardy of being exercised exercised so
113.56 - that the person on the other side of
114.72 - trade gets long stock collects the 50 c
118.12 - dividend all things being equal on my
120.52 - example here of
121.84 - $429 they can go in and the next day and
125.68 - buy these puts for under 50 cents they
127.60 - would lock in a 10-cent profit now
129.68 - that's a very small profit on a dividend
132.36 - play but again something for you to
134.72 - think about when it comes time when you
136.60 - have an spy dividend which is
139.36 - significantly greater somewhere around
141.56 - a150 or so then it makes it a lot more
145.08 - um scary for those who have short
147.40 - options or even just a call spread that
149.92 - might be deep in the money one side gets
151.52 - exercised and all of a sudden you come
153.28 - in you're short 100 shares of stock long
155.60 - your call you have no additional risk
157.64 - but you owe that dividend in spy would
160.24 - be $150 and the Diamonds it would be 50
162.68 - cents all right back to our regularly
164.72 - schedule program that's a little
166.08 - dividend risk play on there you know
168.64 - what I like to do what I always like to
170.48 - do is get rid of these earnings I like
172.68 - to look at a high IV Rank and get rid of
175.16 - these earnings but for now I'll just get
176.92 - rid of the of the earnings here for you
179.28 - I found a stock without going through
181.12 - all of them a little bit we talked about
183.16 - on the show mu a good trading vehicle
186.92 - I've had decent success in there as you
189.32 - can see here um over the last five days
192.20 - this is the ivx 5-day change I'll put a
194.84 - little bit higher for you so you can
196.00 - read there um it's up almost 1 and a
199.04 - half% a little bit over 1 and a half%
202.16 - with an ivy rank of 41 and no earnings
205.44 - looming so for me that makes it well if
208.48 - it's got tight liquid markets and it's
210.16 - in the high option volume list I got to
212.24 - imagine there's players there then it
214.04 - makes it something that I want to look
216.04 - at it makes me interested in looking at
217.52 - it you can see it's already had a decent
219.40 - range today pretty much following the
221.00 - market about mid-range for the day trade
223.76 - up almost 114 down to 11 it's 112 and
227.12 - I'll just round and say a half let's
229.36 - take a
230.48 - look at
232.32 - mu November with 29 days we like to put
236.60 - on trades around 45 days that gets us to
239.48 - these weekly options you take a look at
241.56 - these weekly options and you'll see that
243.08 - they're 20 cents wide for the most part
246.12 - across the board here a little bit
247.48 - tighter on these out of the money
248.52 - options good not great volume uh in open
252.16 - interest when you compare it to let's
254.72 - just even go to December you go to
256.80 - December here's the open interest
258.92 - thousands on every line thousands on
262.00 - every line on the on the put side so for
265.24 - me it's a no-brainer even though there's
267.80 - 64 days to December mber 45 being the
271.36 - closest which will bring us to these
272.92 - November options you don't want to trade
274.88 - these November options in my opinion you
276.76 - want to go with a liquidity is you want
278.80 - to go to these December 20 options with
281.16 - 64 days yeah actually have a higher
283.72 - implied volatility in December than you
285.88 - do in November 51.5% to 48 and change
289.60 - helping you a little bit more when
290.96 - sellling premium so what am I looking at
293.76 - doing here well I have no opinion uh on
296.80 - mu maybe you do uh I I'm going to call
299.52 - it mid-range higher or mid-range for its
302.16 - most recent move um I know the chips and
305.48 - uh stocks are quite hot these days um
308.00 - here's a stock that's been as high as
309.36 - 150 and change and it's been as low as
311.84 - you know 85 and change what am I looking
314.72 - to do here well I'm going to look to do
316.72 - something that has a little bit less
318.28 - risk because I don't like what's going
320.00 - on with volatility for/ VX down 22 cents
324.76 - uh but for/ VX uh volatility staying a
328.00 - little bit bid here and like I said
330.44 - these stocks have been on a little bit
331.72 - of a tear here so I'm going to do
333.12 - something with defined risk it also
335.12 - helps those players who talk about my
337.00 - podcast either write a comment down
339.04 - below which I love to to respond to I
341.12 - respond to every one of them that that I
342.84 - see um maybe use a strategy that has
345.40 - less buying power so that's what I'm
347.40 - going to do here so typically I might
349.68 - look to sell and again you look at the
351.48 - open interest here it's great you know
353.28 - what let's go to um let's change one of
355.56 - these open interest uh to volume and see
358.72 - if I could make a uh point for you here
361.92 - uh volume there you go almost missed it
364.20 - all right what am I looking at at doing
365.88 - here look at the volume here on these
367.60 - options plenty for today so quite liquid
370.84 - look at the markets here they're about
372.36 - 10 cents wide 5 to 10 cents wide
375.20 - depending on the on the strike you're
376.92 - going at here so you got good volume
378.40 - good open interest tight markets High IV
381.08 - rank
382.08 - 41.5% expanding volatility over the last
384.96 - 5 days uh it's up almost 1% typically I
388.36 - might look to sell something in that
390.24 - 20ish Delta range like the 97 and a half
394.16 - put and around uh the 135 calls that
398.60 - might be a classic iron Condor I would
400.84 - like to sell a little bit more risk to
402.88 - the downside because we're just inside
404.56 - the expected move a little bit more um
408.04 - uh room to the upside because you're
410.40 - outside of expected expected move um
414.00 - that strategy we use around $1,100 in a
416.76 - margin account relatively low for the
418.96 - almost
420.44 - in buying power that you're getting
422.56 - probity profit 68% Theta is $10 a day
426.84 - almost 11 that's for the risk that
428.68 - you're taking and it's completely delta
431.56 - neutral less than one Delta obviously
434.64 - the max profits 592 so if I'm looking to
437.56 - put some Capital to work which a
438.72 - relatively small amount of capital and
440.88 - I'm what I'm trying to show you here is
442.20 - on a stock like this where the where the
444.72 - where you're getting so much uh bang for
447.12 - your buck because it has a good monthly
448.64 - implied volatility for those who can
451.00 - afford uh the buying power maybe this is
453.40 - a play to go or those who can afford to
456.00 - um take on the risk of having an
458.20 - undefined risk trade might be something
460.92 - uh you want to do I'm going to go with
463.64 - the same amount of buying power well the
466.28 - risk is going to be a lot less but I'll
468.20 - get to it in a moment I'm going to go to
469.92 - a $10 wide iron Condor typically when
473.24 - we're doing iron Condors just is a quick
475.88 - rule of thumb $100 stock $10 wide $200
479.60 - stock $20 wide $300 stock $30 wide just
483.60 - from our research you'll notice here uh
486.32 - that it doesn't change my risk parameter
488.52 - the green line uh Too Much from the
491.12 - overall play it does bring my buying
493.88 - power down from 1100 to 700 I'll round
497.40 - here my Max profit is going to be
499.12 - whatever I sell it for I sold this for
501.36 - 38 which was the mid price at the time
504.28 - so I'm assuming that maybe you can get
506.24 - uh maybe 309 or or even 310 if you get
509.88 - an uptick or a lucky move in implied
513.12 - volatility uh why am I going to a Define
515.60 - risk trade well I want to use less
517.24 - buying power I doesn't change my risk
520.40 - profile that much but obviously it does
523.08 - change how much buying power I'm using
525.20 - and that strangle does look very juicy
528.12 - for those who can afford uh to take on
530.68 - that extra risk now this is going to
532.24 - move move a lot slower uh even though it
535.28 - has two long Deltas notice what we did
538.04 - here when we took off These Wings for a
540.68 - quick second same strikes that I'm short
543.56 - you're basically delta neutral or let's
545.60 - just call it short one Delta when I buy
549.28 - These
550.96 - Wings $10 wide that can only show you
556.16 - one thing that shows you that this call
559.24 - skew if I'm getting long Delta by going
563.28 - equal distance $10 away from my purchase
565.68 - price when it was basically delta
567.60 - neutral or actually one short Del just
570.08 - another way of looking at you know what
573.24 - uh call skew or put skew might look like
576.08 - in the trades that you're CH taking how
578.76 - they can move your Delta around even
582.00 - though you know by the nature of the
583.72 - Beast you're taking a little bit less
585.04 - risk because you have defined risk how
587.28 - do I um mitigate my risk when this goes
590.40 - against me well when my Delta gets to
592.88 - plus or minus around 15 I'll move up
597.28 - just the short strike so let's assume
599.60 - that mu continues to go higher and my
602.52 - Delta is now short 15 Delta I might take
607.36 - this 97 put and move it up to 105 now
611.04 - obviously the stock is going to be
612.44 - closer to 125 or so when I do this I am
616.64 - using more buying power it changes the
618.64 - buying power to $1,200 from the $700
621.72 - that I had but that's how I mitigate the
625.44 - trade Delta if it continues to go lower
629.00 - and my Delta gets to uh positive 15 I
633.52 - would probably move this call down uh to
636.56 - the 125 strike all things being equal
639.60 - I'm picking up 10 short Deltas I had 15
643.64 - long Deltas again this is just an
645.48 - example I'm reducing my Delta by 50%
648.92 - that's what we mean when we say reducing
650.96 - our Delta by 15% I got filled at 308 you
654.40 - can always see these trades before you
656.36 - see the podcast by going to the follow
658.80 - page clicking on Bob the trader and
661.56 - there you'll see my mu trade when I made
663.76 - it usually around the same time because
666.00 - that's when I get off the show there's
667.36 - nothing magic about this here's where
669.28 - the stock was when I put it on here's
671.40 - where the stock is now here's what the
673.52 - IV rank was a little bit higher at 42
676.76 - 62% probability of success it hasn't
679.28 - changed I like to be around that 65 so a
682.28 - little bit lower credit received 308 I
685.88 - give you a little description here it's
687.48 - a delta neutral iron condor even though
689.60 - you learned from this podcast that it
691.60 - has about two long Deltas which I still
693.44 - consider to be delta neutral all right
695.48 - you know what I'm going to do now Now's
