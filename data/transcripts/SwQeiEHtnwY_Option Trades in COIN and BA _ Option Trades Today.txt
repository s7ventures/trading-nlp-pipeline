0.24 - welcome to option trades today I Tony
2.44 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
4.04 - you today December 3rd 2024 hey not one
8.00 - trade but I got two trades for you guys
10.72 - today that's correct but first as we
12.80 - always do let's take a quick look at
14.92 - what the Market's doing &p is down
18.20 - $7.75 hey I don't know if you know this
20.20 - but if you uh take this little line and
21.96 - drag it you can make it uh smaller down
24.60 - here and bigger up here maybe you have
26.04 - two or three uh different settings that
28.20 - you have down here for charts anyway I
30.12 - made the top bigger by just grabbing
31.96 - this and moving it a little bit lower
34.12 - even S&P is down
35.96 - $7.75 NASDAQ up
38.72 - $10.75 the Dow up sorry Dow I'm sorry
42.88 - Russell down
44.80 - $19.80 and the Dow down 183 volatility
49.40 - in by 5 cents saying to about this
51.48 - Market hey if volatility is not going to
53.68 - percolate down near these lows meaning
55.88 - volatility go higher it's going to be
57.76 - hard for this Market to get really
59.36 - anything going substantially to the
61.68 - downside it looks like at least from a
63.72 - volatility standpoint that it's smooth
65.84 - sailing to the upside for now so take a
68.08 - look at volatility for any kind of
69.76 - movement in the market you know what I
71.32 - like to do here I like to go to our
73.12 - watch list I like to put it uh I like to
76.12 - put IV rank from going from high to low
79.36 - just by simply clicking on the ivy rank
81.60 - that'll make it go from high to low or
83.16 - you can go from low to high or any way
84.96 - that you want to do it I also like to
86.84 - see the ivx 5day change be green it's
89.92 - it's going to be very hard with
91.16 - volatility as I showed you fvx trading
93.52 - near the lows to see any type of
95.80 - volatility going to the upside and the
98.24 - high Ivy rank but I found two the first
100.96 - one's going to be coin let's take a look
103.32 - at that you'll see coin down here at the
105.12 - bottom IV rank of 47 is very nice in
108.32 - this market environment meaning that
109.96 - it's high relative um there's no
113.32 - earnings uh in coin so we're good there
117.36 - the ivx 5day change is down 8% over the
121.00 - last 5 days and that gives me a little
123.20 - bit of like well I don't want to sell
124.92 - premium on both sides I want to be a
126.72 - little bit directional now you know um
129.56 - we had a nice trade in coin last week
132.12 - where we took a buck bucking change on a
134.88 - trade very quickly I'm going to do
136.48 - something very similar to that this time
138.60 - but not quite um as strategic meaning
142.08 - not doing both sides I'm going to do one
144.00 - side I'm going to be omnidirectional
146.44 - slightly bearish on coin but man coin's
149.40 - going to have to double or more in the
152.12 - next month that's in the next not year
156.68 - in the next month the next 45 days for
159.92 - us to be in trouble on this trade if not
162.36 - we collect ourselves uh a nice little
164.56 - buck and change what am I going to do up
166.24 - here well I'm going as far up as I
168.80 - possibly can just about I'm going to
171.24 - look to and I wanted to show you volume
173.12 - here there's plenty of volume being
174.56 - traded here so you're all good here even
176.64 - though the markets seem to be a little
178.00 - bit wider uh this is probably in the
180.24 - money this is Delta and this is volume
182.84 - let's change volume and look at implied
185.36 - volatility if you want to you'll notice
187.52 - that implied volatility as we get higher
189.76 - which is quite normal even in a stock
192.08 - like this that has uh a call skew that
195.40 - the volatility continues to go higher
197.80 - the higher up you go that's how you get
199.56 - something that's you know the 640 and
201.72 - 650 calls are basically the same price
204.08 - and there's not so much difference
205.24 - between the 600s and the 640 because
208.04 - volatility keeps up ticking you'll
210.04 - notice on the
211.40 - downside uh that volatility does exactly
214.36 - the same thing volatility keeps up
216.12 - taking that's why these lower priced
217.68 - options um don't uh evaporate as quickly
221.88 - as you would think they get to a certain
223.40 - point uh and they just can't go any
225.32 - lower because you know what taking that
227.52 - risk off of the table for a liquidity
229.60 - provider is worth something and
231.20 - volatility keeps up ticking so we're
232.76 - going to try to take advantage of that
234.28 - with 45 days to go you know it's optimal
237.48 - 45 days is the time frame that we think
239.56 - is is the sweet spot for putting on
241.56 - trades High IV rank I like to have the
244.16 - ivx 5day change also going higher which
246.92 - we do not have on this trade so I'm
249.00 - going to skew my trade a little bit by
250.80 - going in One Direction what am I going
252.40 - to do I'm going to keep this pretty
253.92 - simple I'm going to buy the 600 calls
255.52 - once I'm going to sell the 650 calls
258.36 - twice you'll notice that the mid price
260.44 - here um is a well now it's a $145
263.64 - because that's exactly where I got
265.24 - filled at
266.64 - a145 matter of fact it was A14 three mid
270.96 - price when I got filled on a do there
273.04 - you go $1 37133 when I got filled at
275.96 - a145 the stock was actually up a buck or
280.28 - so higher than this there you go now it
282.16 - just moved a little bit matter of fact
283.80 - if you go to the watch list here if you
286.48 - have a I'm sorry not the watch list if
287.96 - you go to the follow page and you have a
290.84 - tasty trade account and you just click
292.76 - on Bob the trader you'll see my two
294.44 - trades from today and you'll notice I
296.48 - made this trade when the stock was uh
298.48 - just about 311 it's 308 right now and I
301.92 - got filled at a145 there's the Boeing
304.44 - trade I'm going to give you in just a
305.56 - minute too but I wanted to show you that
308.24 - um coin you'll notice that we took this
310.32 - one off last week or at least I did you
312.88 - could take it off for a better price
314.24 - than I did right now probably I did it
316.20 - for a 430 debit probably trading for
318.24 - around
319.48 - $380 or $3.90 today I got a couple of
322.92 - emails you know why take this off for
324.64 - such a quick Buck profit when you had
326.68 - such a a large win ratio here meaning uh
329.96 - you know it was working for you um a big
332.68 - tent a big green area on any type of um
336.48 - risk profile that you see here why take
338.44 - it off well you know what just put the
340.44 - trade on on the 29th uh I'm sorry we
343.00 - just put the trade on the 26th take the
344.88 - trade off three days later hey run like
346.88 - a thief in the night is what I like to
348.36 - say but you could certainly keep that
350.36 - trade on let's go back to the one that I
352.16 - want to do right now I'm buying the 600
354.40 - calls one time I'm selling two of the
356.72 - 650 calls and I got filled at a dollar
359.72 - 49 uh $145 with the stock trading right
363.76 - here now this is going to show you a
365.40 - high probability of profit because we
367.64 - are well outside the expected move I
371.00 - mean the expected move is only $60 with
373.64 - the stock trading at around 310 will
376.04 - round up that brings you to 370 well
378.72 - this stock is going to have to go from
380.20 - 300 to 600 or more to 650 more than that
385.56 - because our break even is
388.12 - $700 7 $100 on the stock trading 308
391.56 - this is really a way that I look at
393.28 - using capital and getting a return on my
395.80 - money a145 credit for the
399.00 - $6,200 um that I have at risk here my
402.48 - Theta on this is $10 a day better than
405.64 - bonds at least in my point with a high
408.00 - probability of success Delta's -3 on
411.44 - this it is omnidirectional because if we
414.00 - close right at 650 the 600 650 call
418.84 - spread which were long one time will be
421.32 - worth
422.12 - $5,000 plus the
424.32 - $145 that we got credit in here because
427.24 - the $650 calls will be worth nothing if
429.68 - the stock is right at 650 that gives us
432.16 - our Max profit of 5145 what am I really
435.12 - looking to make on this I don't know 100
436.88 - bucks 110 bucks 120 bucks uh again it's
441.36 - a way to put $6,000 and change to work
444.88 - to me with a very high probability of
447.04 - profit uh on a stock with a with an
449.72 - upside potential that maybe you can even
452.04 - catch a catch a nice middle a nice
454.40 - tweener here where the stock goes slowly
457.00 - up to 610 620 630 and these 650 calls
460.68 - will lose a little bit of premium and
462.12 - these 600 calls will gain a lot of
464.16 - Premium remember there's no risk all the
467.12 - way down to zero on this trade and
470.40 - that's why I call it an omnidirectional
472.92 - slightly bearish trade even though you
476.44 - make your most money with the stock up
478.56 - at 600
480.16 - $150 where you make $5,000 in change if
482.92 - not you collect the
484.68 - $145 for the
486.60 - $6,200 and change in risk that you have
489.44 - in coin all right next trade next trade
492.04 - is going to be Boeing ba haven't traded
494.44 - Boeing in a while uh Boeing's been on a
496.48 - little bit of a tear to the upside I
498.60 - know it's significantly off of its highs
500.32 - of 260 or 70 bucks here but it's well
503.68 - off its lows of 138 and I think it's
505.84 - going to meander around in here why do I
508.40 - think that now listen nothing else than
510.48 - just my own Silly opinion again you have
513.64 - to have an opinion when you're trading
515.92 - if you go to the follow page you'll see
517.56 - my Boe trade when did I put this on well
519.76 - when the stock was right here we'll see
521.12 - how much this has moved
523.20 - $3.85 I sold a strangle strangle and
526.44 - high ivr uh is what I put in here you'll
529.44 - notice if you want to see all my Boeing
531.48 - trades you can just click on Boeing
533.64 - right here and you'll see here's about
535.40 - 30 or so um or maybe uh 30 different
539.12 - Trad trades or three months of Trades I
541.92 - don't know you can support at
544.08 - tastytrade.com can give you the uh can
546.84 - give you how much is is here you can see
549.16 - these are trades back from oh it looks
550.52 - like almost a half a year or so maybe
552.76 - six months of Trades but here's all my
554.76 - trades you can see how I did uh in
556.84 - Boeing maybe I'll have the same success
559.24 - here or maybe I did really bad in Boeing
561.24 - you could check it out and see what's
562.48 - going on uh maybe that's a trade you
564.72 - don't do Ivy rank of 38 let's go back to
567.72 - the follow page I'm sorry let's go back
569.96 - to the high option volume list and see
573.44 - where we can find Boeing here's Boeing
575.44 - it does have an ivx that is slightly
578.12 - green by about 1% The Ivy rank is
581.32 - significantly low at 37 and change
583.64 - matter of fact if you look down here
585.48 - you'll notice it's at the lower end of
587.28 - its range not really uh when when Boeing
589.76 - was going stratop feric here uh to the
592.00 - upside uh volatility was actually kind
594.52 - of percolating to the upside as it's
596.60 - been going down volatility been up
598.36 - ticking um so maybe volatility come a
600.84 - little bit lower here with the stock
602.84 - going a little bit higher what am I
604.32 - looking to do in Boeing I set a strangle
607.36 - I'm going to go to the January options
608.84 - because 45 days is optimal for me
610.88 - there's no earnings looming I'm going to
612.88 - sell the 140 puts which have around a
615.48 - 20ish uh Delta around a 20ish Delta 17
619.84 - here 19 uh% probability of being in the
622.84 - money I'm selling the 140s and I'm going
624.96 - to go up to the
626.80 - 175s 20ish Delta also gives me a little
629.72 - bit of short Delta 2 and A2 or so I
632.04 - don't think that's uh um a lot I think I
634.96 - consider that delta neutral brings me
636.88 - right outside these dotted lines which
639.80 - gives me a 71% probability success if I
642.28 - was inside those dotted lines it be
643.68 - closer to 65% $11 in Theta Decay
647.40 - actually higher than what I was getting
650.60 - in coin per day by using a lot less
653.60 - buying power 15 or6 $100 in buying power
658.20 - collecting $3
659.92 - 85 Which is higher than the
662.60 - $145 uh I was receiving for a coin
666.56 - you'll notice that my coin credit I
669.36 - received was a $145 this is 380 two
673.56 - times or more as much as my
677.68 - coin uh credit I received yet the Theta
681.36 - Decay is $10 versus $11 you would think
684.84 - that if all things were equal that my
686.92 - Theta decay in coin would be half as
689.04 - much five or $6 $7 versus the $11 but no
693.00 - that's because the implied volatility
694.84 - monthly implied volatility is so much
696.48 - higher in coin than it is in Boeing
701.32 - selling to 140 175 using $15 or $1600 in
705.28 - buying power Max profit $384 you'll
708.24 - notice how the Delta moves ever so
710.16 - slightly as the stock goes a little bit
711.52 - lower I got filled right here well
713.28 - actually 385 one tick one penny uh
716.84 - higher than this and gets me outside of
719.32 - the expected what would I do here um if
721.92 - I get in trouble I get that that
723.88 - question a lot because you know the
725.48 - profits take care of themselves the
726.80 - stock stays here you make a buck or two
728.40 - and you get out of the trade that's easy
730.72 - well if my Delta on this overall trade
733.12 - gets to plus or minus 15 I will move up
737.04 - or down the untested side so for
738.72 - argument sakes if the Delta on this
740.80 - trade got to around 15 or 16 short
743.64 - Deltas I would move up the puts until I
747.12 - got you know 5 7 10 Deltas on that trade
750.68 - if it happened tomorrow I would probably
752.60 - only have to move up one strike because
755.12 - you'll notice there's 17 Deltas here 26
757.88 - Deltas here that gives me nine Deltas if
760.04 - I were to roll up just using this as a
762.16 - really quick example and I had 15 short
765.60 - Deltas I would pick up nine long Deltas
769.28 - that would leave me six short Deltas on
771.56 - the overall trade and conversely if I
774.16 - got long 15 Deltas I'd move down by one
777.48 - strike and that would pick me up my
779.56 - Deltas that I need that's how I adjust
781.92 - all of my trades and I'm pretty
783.72 - mechanical with that you know what I
785.32 - need you to be mechanical with I need
