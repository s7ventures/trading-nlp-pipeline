0.20 - optimizing Wing width and buying power
3.00 - when aiming to gain exposure to a
4.84 - particular underlying and limit and the
6.40 - limiting factor is the buying power
7.64 - requirement of the trade so expensive
9.92 - underlyings are tradable with virtually
11.60 - any account size one of the things that
13.52 - I always tell people I love about
15.00 - options in general and one of the
17.20 - reasons they're so popular now and
19.16 - they're the fastest growing of all the
20.56 - financial products is
23.20 - because in the world of finance things
25.44 - are expensive now you know like stocks
27.68 - that used to be you know how tradable
29.68 - are is Tesla $350 for most people 100
33.40 - Shar
34.64 - $35,000 how tradable is you know is is
39.32 - snow at 100 I'm just looking at my
40.84 - screen you know and every stock is crazy
44.12 - expensive now even you know even if you
46.36 - wanted to buy United Airlines it's
48.08 - $10,000 to buy 100 shares you know so
52.64 - one of the things that options have done
54.12 - is they've made financial
56.12 - markets in in light of the fact that the
58.44 - financial markets are significant ific L
60.40 - higher than they were a couple of years
62.52 - ago they've made financial markets
64.84 - accessible to anybody because option
67.36 - strategies allow you to trade a $200
69.48 - stock a $500 stock thousand stock with a
72.16 - couple hundred dollars I'm not they put
74.52 - they put it in they put it in the reach
75.72 - of everyone yeah I'm not talking about
77.44 - buying out of the money calls I'm
79.24 - talking about you know you can do an at
80.36 - the money spread there's no $5 spread
83.44 - that's at the money that you can't do
84.84 - for $2.50 or 250 bucks right there's
88.32 - literally not one if you you buy an at
90.44 - the money spread in any underlying where
92.72 - you're one strike in the money one
93.96 - strike out of the money you're going to
95.40 - be 10 cents around $2.50 risk one to
98.56 - make one that's it so you can basically
101.92 - buy any trade any single stock you want
103.68 - in the world up or down you can buy an
105.92 - at the money put spread or an at the
107.08 - money call spread for $2.50 so you risk
109.64 - $2.50 to make $2.50 with a 50-50 shot
114.12 - that puts everything in play for
116.36 - everybody so this study aims to address
119.16 - the question
120.40 - how can we optimize buying power
122.00 - requirements for different types of
123.20 - neutral strategies with different Wing
125.64 - widths sounds a little heavy but it's
127.68 - not let's go next
131.04 - slide
133.04 - 2014 to 2024 10 years of research 45
137.56 - days to expiration manag to 21 days we
140.24 - compared the average buying power for
141.80 - multiple underlying um a multiple
144.36 - underlying price upon entry for the
145.92 - following
146.92 - positions 10 16 20 and 30 Delta Les and
150.24 - iron Condors with 16 Delta short strikes
152.56 - and long wings of 510 and 13 Deltas so
156.32 - we're all over the place here let's go
158.12 - next slide we have every Delta
161.08 - covered so for shorts strangles the
163.28 - average buying power um the average
166.08 - buying power to underlying price Rao
167.88 - ranged from 19 to 23 meaning that these
170.52 - strategies would roughly require 11,000
173.48 - to
174.52 - 13,500 in buying power if the Spy is
177.16 - trading for $600 regardless of of what
181.00 - Delta you chose okay so um just as an
185.88 - example because we're talking about how
187.08 - much money so the average buying power
189.20 - as a result of price you know it just
192.44 - we're just talking about the Delta vers
194.60 - the price just so you can put some
196.32 - context runs so how much does it cost to
198.36 - do one strangle whether it's 10 Deltas
200.60 - 16 Deltas 20 Deltas or 30 Deltas it's
203.20 - between 11,000 and
204.84 - 13,000 okay just because the price is so
207.60 - expensive of those underlyings let's go
209.84 - next
211.36 - slide so the varing Deltas of these
214.68 - strategies had a fairly small impact on
216.24 - the buying power requirements of the
217.32 - trade meaning the strangles with
219.08 - expensive underlyings are generally
220.76 - unsuitable for smaller accounts because
222.84 - even if you go further out of the money
223.96 - you still have to put up the same amount
224.96 - of money within reason so however in
228.36 - terms of risk with a strangle when you
230.56 - widen the wings it reduces your buffer
232.36 - against extreme losses so a higher ratio
235.64 - indicates a more secure risk profile you
239.40 - know
240.64 - that that's it all it's saying is if you
242.44 - go wider you just got much wider Break
244.44 - Even losses okay so that's your buying
247.32 - power divided by your worst loss but if
250.24 - you go to the next
252.60 - slide where we're going to look at iron
254.52 - condors and remember this is 10 years of
256.76 - data from 2014 to 2024 these are selling
260.32 - a 16 Delta short and buying the 510 and
264.28 - 13 Delta wings so comparatively iron
267.44 - Condors with the same underlying have
269.40 - sign ific lower buying power
271.48 - requirements um one time to 22 times
275.56 - less depending on the long wings so an
278.00 - iron Condor would require between $600
281.36 - and 4700 in buying power if the Spy was
284.40 - trading at the same price 600 bucks to
287.24 - make it more appropriate for expensive
289.44 - underlyings and smaller accounts so you
291.92 - can see here I mean forget about the 136
294.80 - because that's really narrow but you can
296.64 - see with the other ones you know it's
299.24 - again
300.32 - it's a fraction of what it would cost
302.44 - for a um for a wide strangle or you know
308.04 - a a it's a fraction of what it across
311.00 - for a 16 delt
312.68 - triangle um anyway so you can kind of
315.32 - see the average buying power as a
317.60 - percent uh divided by underlying price
319.56 - is eight times three times than one time
321.80 - depending on how wide we make the wing
323.20 - so it's between 600 and
326.80 - $4,700 hopefully that makes sense yeah
330.12 - for sure yeah and the the strangle is 22
332.40 - times so just to put things into
336.48 - context
338.12 - um let's go to the next
342.72 - slide so the choice of long Delta for an
345.24 - iron Condor also has a marger much
346.84 - larger impact on buying power of the
348.40 - trade compared to the choice of short
350.88 - Delta for the strangle what we learned
353.40 - from the first slide was if you choose a
355.00 - different Delta for the strangle it can
357.16 - vary a little bit but not much more than
359.00 - like 10% % but if you choose a different
362.12 - strike for the iron Condor it could vary
365.88 - as much as
368.08 - 500% you know or actually higher than
370.92 - that even
373.00 - 600% so this makes it a fairly versatile
376.44 - strategy the iron Condor offering a high
379.12 - pop high probabil high pop high buying
381.76 - power profiles for larger accounts in a
383.92 - lower pop lower browing profiles lower
387.32 - buying power reduction profiles for
388.84 - smaller accounts
390.72 - the widening of the Wings and iron condr
392.60 - becomes the strike price distances
394.72 - offering a larger profit range but
397.76 - reducing the premium collected and
399.48 - thereby decreasing the buffer
402.60 - significantly there's nothing to take
405.16 - away from this other than risk is very
408.16 - symmetrical when it comes to options and
411.80 - sometimes the amount of money you have
413.92 - will dictate your price
415.76 - selection sometimes the amount of risk
417.88 - you want to take will dictate your price
419.76 - selection but sure especially for for
423.16 - larger accounts you have a lot more
424.88 - optionality or flexibility for smaller
427.64 - accounts sometimes you just have to do
430.00 - what you are capable of doing based on
431.52 - the amount of money that you have so
433.56 - sometimes that's the restrictive part of
435.24 - smaller accounts you're not
437.36 - disadvantaged in any way but you just
439.72 - have limitations as to what you can
442.64 - do let's go to last slide last one yep
447.00 - so expensive underlyings are tradable
449.36 - with with virtually any account size but
452.08 - the appropriate strategy is going to
453.32 - depend on the total buying power of a
454.72 - portfolio you don't want to get much
456.56 - bigger then you know if it's Define risk
460.24 - I'm going to say 1 to 3% unless it's a
463.24 - small account then you know 5 to 7% if
465.88 - it's undefined risk 3 to 5% a larger
468.56 - account and um you know five to seven
473.56 - five to 10% a smaller account just be
475.88 - careful keep those numbers as low as you
477.60 - can think as as you can try te as low as
480.44 - you can strangles with expensive
483.40 - underlyings are generally unsuitable for
485.04 - smaller accounts regardless of Delta as
487.12 - we showed you don't save a lot by
488.72 - widening the strikes and comparatively
491.08 - the buying power requirements for iron
492.32 - Condors are very sensitive to wing withd
494.92 - and they offer a high pop high buying
497.12 - power requirement for larger accounts
499.52 - and a lower pop lower buying power
501.80 - requirements for smaller accounts
