0.08 - there's a couple of different ways to
1.24 - look at profit targets right there is
4.76 - you can say you want to make 50% of the
7.04 - credit you receive right that's one way
9.68 - yeah yeah you can say we're going to
11.36 - manage a 21 DTE wherever it is that's
13.84 - like one of the things we do right yep
16.56 - th those are I wouldn't call either of
19.00 - those two Dynamic those are kind of like
20.60 - static right you're either managing at
22.80 - 50% or you're managing at
24.88 - 21dt but what if you just gave a little
27.64 - flexibility like what if you made
30.36 - um more money sooner like you put a
34.80 - position on today and it actually
37.12 - worked okay all right that would be
40.96 - something so if you want to take profits
42.36 - let's say 25% that would be dynamic
44.84 - right yeah I got I got emails about this
47.28 - last night people volatility contracted
49.16 - they caught a good volatility run here
50.64 - and they're saying hey do I wait to 21
52.16 - days or do I close stuff this is very
54.84 - timely
57.92 - um let's
60.56 - let's take a look at the first
64.96 - slide so when it comes to option trading
67.60 - management mechanics can make all the
69.12 - difference this is one of the key
71.20 - takeaways that Tony and I have learned
73.12 - in the last couple of years that the
75.32 - management mechanics are make a big big
78.48 - difference at Tasty we generally favor
80.80 - locking in profits looking at the 50th
83.36 - um looking for 50% of the credit
84.88 - received for short option position but
87.44 - is this too
88.92 - rigid that is a good question a common
92.24 - scenario is a trade that makes a good
94.44 - profit but shive the 50% early in its
97.44 - lifespan should we capture 25% profit
100.56 - after one week or should we hold out a
102.00 - bit
102.80 - longer let's explore the effects of
105.80 - adjusting our profit targets looking for
107.48 - more profit from trades that stay on
109.60 - longer and be willing to take a quick
111.00 - buck when things go really early that
113.36 - would be kind of the definition of
116.60 - dynamic let's go to the next slide
122.00 - so 15 years worth of data spy Q's iwm 30
126.48 - Delta strangles 45 days expiration
128.52 - contrasted the results of several
130.04 - management techniques closing positions
132.36 - at 50% of Max
135.36 - profit waiting one week to avoid closing
138.88 - tiny winners immediately after opening
140.48 - them and then closing positions if they
142.40 - reach a larger percentage of Max profit
145.76 - um of the maximum profit percentage of
148.00 - the duration that had elapsed so so what
152.16 - all that means is if you make money in a
154.20 - shorter period of time what does all
155.60 - that what does all that mean means it
157.80 - means if you
159.08 - make if you don't get to 50% but you
161.68 - make like a pro-rated like you make
163.84 - 25% instead of getting to 50% in 24 days
168.12 - let's say you get to 25% in a week or 10
171.08 - days you take your profits okay that's
174.40 - Dynamic and then there's closing
176.24 - positions at 21 days win or lose and
179.04 - then there's also Le leaving all the
180.36 - positions in through expiration okay so
182.24 - there's four choices here 21 days
185.32 - expiration dynamic or 50% all right you
190.56 - good with that Okie doie yep yep okay no
193.28 - I just want to make sure we're we're
194.48 - good okay so let's go to the next
200.20 - slide all right so this is the Spy now
203.64 - interesting remember the the four
205.76 - columns
208.44 - 50% um 79% of the time Dynamic 82 21
214.28 - days
215.20 - 75 and expiration 68 we've already we're
219.16 - going to rule out expiration because we
220.64 - don't do that at all right sure we're
223.84 - not hold to the end of we are kind of
226.88 - the 21 days would be I would say that
230.00 - we're between Dynamic and 21 days what
232.72 - would you say agreed agreed dynamic in
235.56 - 21 days okay and matter of fact matter
238.36 - of fact in on my podcast I'm more
240.64 - Dynamic than I am 21 days but sure okay
243.60 - I'm I think I'm more 21 days but it
246.72 - doesn't really matter we're we're in
248.80 - kind of agreement when you look at these
250.48 - numbers 50% kind of is pretty good the
255.52 - 21 days has the lowest sear which is
257.92 - where we are that's what we're trying to
259.08 - do is reduce the risk but so that that
261.88 - that's that's impressive but there none
264.96 - of these are none of these are supposed
267.52 - to be dramatically better than anything
269.20 - else
270.56 - they're all supposed to just have their
272.20 - you know like to give you some insight
274.76 - into what do you think is optimal yep so
278.24 - for the Spy you know I'm pretty happy
281.08 - with the 21 days that we do because the
282.84 - low sear and the decent um win
285.76 - percentage if you're Dynamic like the
287.56 - bad is you know you're going to be fine
289.52 - with the higher win percentage just less
291.32 - profits because you're managing early
292.84 - yep and if you're waiting for the 50%
295.36 - you can't complain about that either yep
298.32 - um and even expiration in this case
300.36 - worked let's go to the next one Johan so
303.92 - the next one's iwm now the first thing
305.92 - you notice about I it's a smaller
307.60 - product all the numbers are going to be
308.56 - lower um the weird thing here is that
312.12 - the 21dt here the wi percentage a little
315.40 - lower but the profits are higher and the
318.48 - C bar is lower this one 21 days in iwm
322.16 - seems fine but if you did the 50% and
324.20 - you did the dynamic those are also fine
327.44 - MH like bat would do Dynamic here 85% in
330.32 - $23 is is better than
332.64 - 50% sure sure with a lower
336.48 - seabar but I just like ringing the
338.88 - register on the podcast trade just to
340.52 - show people that you can do this you
342.04 - know yeah I understand ringing the
344.16 - register and then and then you make your
345.84 - judgment from there you know maybe you
347.12 - don't have as many positions that I have
348.64 - on and you'd like to you know hang in
350.28 - there a little bit longer but at least
352.00 - the whole our whole thing is about doing
354.64 - something actively and sometimes doing
356.44 - something actively is doing nothing but
358.16 - you're you're not just setting it and
360.36 - forgetting it you're you're actively
362.36 - watching your portfolio which is what I
363.96 - want people to do I mean so many people
366.76 - uh have the bestman advisors or they
368.64 - just put things in funds they they don't
370.20 - even know the symbol to the funds that
372.12 - they're in or what they have on or if
374.12 - they're even mirroring the market so I
376.32 - like you to watch I I want you to be
377.80 - active that's what I'm trying to
380.08 - do um look for opportunity let's go to
384.00 - the next slide which is the
387.04 - cues and in the cues
389.96 - it's weird because they've had such a
391.28 - big up move you know that that the p&l
393.92 - numbers are just not that good for
395.40 - strangles but um here you know you'd be
399.84 - again the 21 days stands out as the
401.92 - lowest siar um but from a profitability
405.04 - standpoint and a win percentage you know
407.44 - the 50% or the dynamic is you know I
411.28 - mean personally after looking at
413.84 - these you got to go dynamic or 21dt the
417.28 - 50% sounds good but it's hard to know
419.72 - that is after all the
421.92 - adjustments
423.64 - beautiful um let's go to the next
430.72 - slide um
433.48 - so some of the takeaways the dynamic
436.08 - management um averaged closing trades
439.16 - with around 23 days to expiration for
442.00 - both spy and iwm while failing to
444.92 - outperform the 21dt management but for
447.56 - more volatile things like the q's
450.12 - uh being willing to to rapidly capture
453.48 - modest profits resulted in closing
455.04 - trades with an average of 31 DT and
457.80 - improved your trade p&l Dynamic profits
460.60 - were re were a reasonable alternative to
463.24 - harden fast 50% goals for the active
465.56 - Trader who does not depend on limit
467.80 - orders but only early management win or
471.12 - lose was a substantial Safeguard against
474.52 - bad
475.44 - losers you know um I think one of the
478.40 - things that the research team pointed
480.08 - out here um is
484.40 - that you can see how close all of these
488.04 - results really are and I would say that
491.88 - there isn't a clear winner except
494.08 - holding to expiration doesn't really
495.52 - make a lot of sense for us and the
498.08 - problem with
499.40 - 50% is that it's hard to tell what 50%
502.96 - is after you've made a bunch of
504.24 - adjustments so managing the trades early
507.24 - and dynamically or doing it at 21 days
509.88 - makes the most sense to me
