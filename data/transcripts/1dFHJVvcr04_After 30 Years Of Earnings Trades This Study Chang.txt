0.20 - what comes after earnings let's take a
3.72 - look do stocks go the way of earnings or
7.40 - do they go the other way uh I I I
11.08 - believe after earnings I believe they
13.68 - they Trend sideways for the most part I
16.16 - mean I think depending on the and again
18.76 - I haven't seen this the the study set I
21.64 - would say it was sideways to higher just
23.52 - because we're at all-time high snof so
26.16 - the question
27.40 - is if you have an earnings report that's
31.28 - in line obviously afterwards the
33.72 - Market's probably going to do you know
35.52 - the same as it was doing before but if
37.68 - you have a stock that has a really good
39.28 - earnings report or a really bad earnings
41.20 - report do you think the market continues
43.56 - to Trend in the direction that it went
46.16 - or do you think that it all normalizes
47.88 - and just becomes random again in a in a
50.28 - 45 day time frame after the trade is
52.56 - made I got to say it's all random
54.72 - immediately following I would say it
57.96 - kind of stays in the direction it's in I
60.36 - don't know if I'm answering I don't know
61.80 - if I'm answering to the to the study
64.12 - let's take a very good let's take a good
68.28 - hard look at this because it's really
70.04 - interesting and some of the results are
72.20 - a little different than you might think
73.92 - publicly traded companies released
75.16 - quarterly earnings reports detailing
77.20 - their financial performance these
78.72 - reports come out either before the
80.04 - Market opens or after the market closes
82.24 - the overnight moves accompanying these
83.64 - releases are often dramatic because this
85.88 - is anticipated implied volatility is
88.48 - typically elevated just before earnings
90.96 - and falls off after we've explored
93.96 - placing earnings trades before but
96.52 - whether you have an earnings position
98.36 - still on or you're considering trading
100.88 - and underlying now that the dust is
102.44 - settled what happens to the underlyings
104.76 - in the weeks following an earnings
106.60 - report this is an important question for
108.48 - retail Traders let's take a look this is
110.80 - the first kind of study we've done
113.24 - exactly on like this topic next slide
116.00 - please
116.92 - John so We examined each earnings
120.48 - announcement from the 15 largest
122.24 - components of the S&P 500 for the past
125.16 - eight years so it's a massive study for
128.88 - each we looked at the overnights
130.40 - earnings move and the 7-Day move and
132.88 - then the 30-day move close to
135.92 - close um following the earnings move we
138.56 - looked at overnight 7day 30-day all
141.68 - right all right correlation from minus
144.52 - one to plus one between the size of the
146.92 - earnings moves and the size of the
148.12 - following moves how frequently the
150.96 - following move was the same direction as
152.64 - the earnings move as we call that
155.68 - continuation the average size of the
158.52 - seven and 30 day moves meaning the the
161.32 - mean the mean absolute so we contrasted
165.16 - the overall statistics those following
166.60 - earnings moves that did or did not
168.04 - exceed the implied
170.64 - move and we just put a little caveat at
173.52 - the bottom says note that these earnings
175.68 - moves only stayed inside expected 48% of
179.36 - the time far below theoretical or the
183.00 - empirical non- earnings frequencies yeah
186.12 - okay
187.80 - okay let's go to the next
191.64 - slide so what comes after earnings so
195.44 - the first what we looked at was overall
198.32 - okay so the
200.72 - correlation the
202.88 - continuation and the mean absolute move
206.96 - so this is interesting because you know
208.88 - how sometimes we go well it's only got
210.48 - priced in a 3% move and stuff like this
213.00 - remember this is the top 15 stocks over
215.32 - eight years in the S&P 500 so when we
218.68 - look at the overall the size
222.76 - correlation and the continuation the
226.12 - first thing that pops up here is that um
229.76 - you know what these moves tend to be a
232.08 - little greater than whatever the
234.40 - expectation is right around
236.28 - earnings because those are higher
238.36 - numbers the absolute the mean absolute
240.60 - move and the continuation number is a
243.44 - little higher than a random number would
245.16 - be yeah I mean they're just they're a
247.36 - little bit higher so the size
249.80 - correlation is also interesting in
251.40 - saying that after seven days there's
253.64 - some correlation after 30 days there's a
255.52 - little less correlation but the
257.84 - continuation of the move is pretty good
261.04 - so on this slide um this is with
263.76 - earnings inside the expected move now of
266.40 - course if it's inside the expected move
268.68 - the correlation is going to be be lower
270.88 - and the continuation is going to be
272.72 - lower and then the mean absolute move
274.84 - after 7 days is obviously smaller and
276.80 - after 30 days is small so when they're
278.76 - inside the expected move I would say
281.16 - this is pretty random 52% you know that
285.52 - that's probably in in line with just a
288.12 - completely random number so if the
290.16 - earnings are inside the expected move
293.08 - then there's not that much to actually
296.68 - consider right about a continuation or
299.08 - stuff like that
300.48 - yeah 100% let's go to the next Slide
302.64 - John this is earnings outside of the
305.44 - expected move well here everything
308.32 - changes and you can look at the size
310.96 - correlation you can look at the
312.72 - continuation numbers and you can look at
315.00 - the size of the mean absolute move and
317.48 - what happens for earnings moves outside
319.80 - of the expected move is that there tends
322.60 - to be a very high continuation move
327.28 - after the actual after the number comes
329.32 - out so if you have a really bad earnings
331.44 - report there tends to be you know eight
334.16 - out of 10 times the stock continues to
335.76 - go lower after seven days and seven out
338.96 - of 10 times after 30 days and this is in
341.88 - the top 15 stocks in the S&P 500 and and
345.24 - if it's and and I think those numbers
348.92 - are do have a lot of value to them
351.80 - agreed I I think they do to and the mean
353.84 - absolute move is usually greater than
355.48 - you think it's going to be so it means
357.08 - you got to be a little bit aggressive
358.28 - especially if you're looking to roll up
359.80 - the untested side or do anything like
361.24 - that I mean that's my takeaway I think
362.92 - that's fair yeah this is this is a very
366.12 - this is a very powerful slide that we
368.28 - haven't done before and it's funny
370.00 - because if I think back about emails
371.72 - that I get for earnings you know if if a
374.16 - stock moves let's say you know outside
376.32 - the expected move to the downside even
378.12 - though the Market's a little bit you
379.40 - know bid the way it is right now at at
381.92 - Market highs you know people sit for a
384.64 - couple of days because they think it's
385.76 - going to correlate with the market or
387.12 - come back a little bit most of the time
389.36 - the it is like what do I do now I didn't
390.92 - roll that kind of thing so I think being
392.96 - aggressive with the rolling is probably
395.12 - uh my biggest takeway for this okay
397.96 - bigger numbers than I thought way bigger
400.00 - I thought there'd be a little bit of
401.24 - positive you know outlier moves would be
403.24 - have a little bit of positive
404.76 - continuation but not from 5050 to 8 out
408.08 - of 10 when earnings moves fell within
411.00 - the expectation the underlying
412.64 - afterwards performed like the
413.88 - underlyings any other time that's
415.80 - exactly what we that was our takeaway
417.92 - the following unexpected large earning
420.08 - moves however we saw the underlyings
422.44 - making large moves very frequently
424.20 - continuing in the direction of earnings
425.76 - like 70 to 80% of the time these moves
428.76 - might well be anticipated and priced
430.84 - into the premiums available post
432.84 - earnings but understanding what is
435.56 - typical following earnings can help you
437.56 - choose how to play it yes it definitely
440.60 - is going
441.76 - to influence it impact our decision
445.08 - somewhat so very good uh Market
