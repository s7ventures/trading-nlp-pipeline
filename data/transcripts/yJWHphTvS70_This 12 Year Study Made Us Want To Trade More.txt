0.36 - let's do it let's do everybody's
1.68 - favorite occurrences what's An
2.96 - Occurrence and why does it matter we
4.68 - talk about occurrences a lot we talk
6.40 - about why it is important to or why it
9.20 - can be beneficial to achieve a high
10.80 - number of occurrences for certain types
12.28 - of strategies um but I wanted to talk in
14.68 - detail about exactly what an occurrences
16.68 - because I think there's some nuances
18.28 - that could lead to an interesting
19.36 - discussion oh man we to prove this in
22.44 - advance we're going to have a lot of
23.64 - arguments I think over what An
25.28 - Occurrence is what could it possibly be
27.48 - I don't know but let's get into it um so
30.04 - we talk right about trading often and
32.48 - because uh the really goal behind
34.00 - trading often is achieving a high number
36.36 - of statistical occurrences and the idea
38.48 - behind that is that it reduces strategy
40.28 - variance and increases the chances of
41.80 - realizing long-term averages over time
44.00 - so if you have a strategy that is likely
46.52 - to have a positive expected value over
48.52 - time such as a short option strategy
50.24 - when we look at long-term pnls then in
52.32 - order to most likely realize that um you
55.48 - generally want to trade frequently and
57.12 - over a long period of time but there's a
58.76 - little bit of nuance ining exactly what
60.72 - An Occurrence is and so today I wanted
62.36 - to talk about it and why it kind of
63.92 - matters yeah let's do it let's do it
66.64 - let's go to the next slide okay so for
68.28 - bit a bit of background um I'm sure you
70.20 - guys are familiar with doing your
71.52 - statistical analyses you guys are
72.96 - familiar with your stats 101 right of
75.44 - course we yes we live for them we live
77.32 - for the stats we live for the stats um
79.48 - but when we generally when we want to
81.64 - analyze some kind of population or
83.36 - system we typically want a large number
85.16 - of measurements right from that system
87.12 - we want a large sample size to reduce
89.20 - sort of sampling errors and ensure that
90.80 - the results are statistically
92.24 - representative of that system right if
94.00 - we're trying to measure kind of anything
95.16 - any kind of system any kind of
96.16 - population if we want to get
97.68 - representative statistics we generally
99.36 - want a large number of measurements from
101.08 - that system right and so when we tie
103.32 - this into strategies and sort of
105.00 - evaluating how they perform in the stock
106.64 - market which is a system right that
108.48 - evolves in time we generally want data
110.60 - that spans a long time and captures a
112.44 - variety of market conditions which then
114.64 - decreases the variance of those kind of
116.64 - short-term fluctuations on those
118.40 - strategy averages and provid a more
120.32 - accurate estimate for sort of long run
122.36 - expected Behavior which is kind of what
124.00 - we're trying to do we're playing you
124.92 - know long game right got it a lot of
126.76 - these strategies so we generally want a
128.72 - large number of occurrences that's kind
130.16 - of rooted in this sort of statistical
132.20 - basis for sort of trying to smooth out
133.92 - our pnls over time law of large numbers
136.20 - that is involved yeah exactly right T
138.04 - Tony remember the law of large numbers
139.96 - the central Li all our stat yeah we we
143.36 - Tony and I probably talk Central liit
145.28 - theorem once a day I I can imagine at
147.44 - least it's on my mind all the time I
149.28 - guarantee it um let's go on over to the
151.44 - next slide so this is kind of our
152.80 - background um so this right motivates
155.64 - this trade small and trade off in Mantra
157.72 - it's based on the statistical principle
159.92 - and assumes that if we trade sort of
161.56 - consistently small trades over a long
163.52 - period of time that's going to reduce
164.88 - p&l variance over time the variance of
167.08 - different average outcomes um that sort
169.16 - of arise maybe from the noise in the
170.96 - market and brings the strategy average
172.76 - closer to its expected value noting that
174.60 - these averages tend to be positive for a
176.36 - lot of the short-term or short premium
178.16 - strategies that we look at right you
180.08 - know we built our whole career around
181.36 - this it's an important concept that's
182.92 - why we built our literally built our
184.80 - entire career floor training career
186.48 - around this without knowing any of this
189.20 - stuff right like without knowing
191.36 - anything about law of large numbers or
193.04 - Central limit theorem we would we we did
196.68 - believe in the trade often NE trade
199.92 - small but the trade often and and I'm
201.80 - sure Blackjack Blackjack teaches a lot
203.52 - of lessons as well not really because
206.24 - does no blackjacket ways or lose your
208.40 - discipline
210.04 - it's actually a really fair point yeah
212.00 - um yeah it's a really really fair point
213.84 - I don't know I like I would argue I
216.24 - would argue that in a casino with
218.60 - Negative Edge trade small trade often is
221.28 - what the casino wants you to do exactly
223.12 - but not what you want to do but I think
225.08 - just like that looking at it from the
226.56 - context of that game helped me
228.16 - understand this a bit more just CU like
229.48 - markets are kind of volatile and crazy
231.60 - and get yeah but that would that doesn't
232.84 - help the consumer it doesn't no but it's
235.16 - just more of a nice mathematical analogy
237.16 - that I found interesting when I was
238.32 - learning about this but you're right
239.56 - that like it's specifically you want to
241.12 - trade small and often when there's
242.84 - evidence that there might be some kind
244.32 - of long-term positive expected value for
247.84 - that game right or at least not a
249.64 - negative or at least not a negative one
251.84 - and you know kind of gauging that is
253.36 - there's a lot of nuances to estimating
255.08 - that as well but for a lot of short
256.48 - premium strategies we have done back
258.28 - tests and there's evidence that this
259.64 - might be true right so that's where this
261.08 - trade small trade often comes from and
262.40 - it's rooted in this kind of statistical
263.88 - principle although these two guys
265.36 - figured it out all on their own which is
268.12 - awesome right but this is is all
269.92 - background right so this all this is
271.44 - kind of like where this kind of comes
273.04 - from what the statistical justification
274.96 - for doing this is right all make sense
277.08 - yeah okay so let's go on over to the
278.52 - next
279.56 - slide so in this sense occurrence is
283.44 - really considered any completed trade
285.68 - with a specific underlying contract type
287.76 - Delta expiration like 16 Delta 45 DTE
290.60 - spice strangle you know placing one of
292.56 - those trades every month or something
294.00 - like that is monthly occurrence that's
295.96 - what we are meaning when we say the word
297.32 - occurrence it's a completed trade with
298.88 - specific parameters with specific
300.28 - underlying contract types Deltas all
301.96 - that stuff but remember that when we
304.80 - talk about achieving a high number of
306.44 - occurrences this kind of underlying goal
309.12 - is that we want to minimize the impact
310.72 - of sort of short-term fluctuations on
313.00 - our strategy averages right we're trying
314.88 - to average over a bunch of different
316.56 - market conditions a bunch of different
318.28 - sort of time-sensitive risk factors
320.60 - right so that kind of means that ideally
323.80 - the occurrences that we're counting
325.08 - towards a specific strategy should have
327.16 - some variation in Risk profile that's
329.96 - the Nuance that I think maybe we don't
331.80 - talk about as much but one that I wanted
333.12 - to kind of bring up here so for example
335.12 - if you sell a 45 DTE 16 Delta spice
337.20 - strangle at at the open and then sell
339.24 - another one at noon that might not
341.40 - really give you the impact of two truly
344.28 - distinct occurrences right because the
345.88 - market conditions may not have
347.12 - substantially changed in between the
348.96 - time when you open the first trade and
350.00 - the time that you open the second trade
351.68 - right that's possible but we do consider
354.24 - those to be occurrences I know so
356.24 - technically they are like gen in the
357.96 - general sense these are just trades but
360.12 - if the goal of achieving a large number
362.00 - of occurrences is to kind of smooth out
363.80 - our p&l over time you're not necessarily
367.04 - going to get the impact of having a
368.76 - distinct occurrence I guess I should say
370.88 - um depending on how you space out your
372.40 - traits there's a difference between um
375.60 - so the way that I would explain it is
380.44 - there's is is like how they explain
382.96 - things on online there's oh God I don't
386.24 - know if that's how you want to do things
387.80 - no like there's certain number
392.80 - of viewers yeah but then there's also
396.64 - like unique viewers yeah so what you're
399.40 - talking about is unique viewers
401.92 - sure we refer to everything as kind of
404.88 - total views sure because for Simplicity
408.76 - sure we don't want to break everything
410.56 - down like and have to put an aster next
412.96 - everything so so we don't think of
414.88 - things in terms of unique viewers we
417.36 - think of things in total viewers sure I
419.56 - I think that like I I completely
421.60 - understand the perspective of Simplicity
423.40 - and technically that is true if you put
424.68 - on a trade and you close the trade like
426.08 - that is An Occurrence but if your goal
428.56 - is to achieve occurrences with the
430.84 - specific intention of smoothing your
432.52 - pnls out right yeah I understand I agree
434.96 - with you understanding this Nuance of
436.72 - what the kind of unique or distinct
438.48 - occurrence is I think is important right
440.80 - sense yeah let's go to the next
443.36 - slide so under normal market conditions
446.80 - right there is usually a strong ER case
450.00 - for counting a trade towards a unique
451.68 - occurrence for a particular strategy if
453.16 - there's like a little bit of buffer time
454.68 - that's passed between trades really what
456.88 - you want between your occurrences to
458.36 - kind of make a strong case for counting
459.84 - them as unique is to have a change or a
462.76 - shift in the risk profile of the trade
465.36 - that doesn't necessarily need to have
467.16 - like a long time to pass in order for
468.76 - that to happen right because like if you
470.20 - think about like a crazy Market um or
472.28 - like you know when the vix contracts by
474.04 - 20% in a day or something like that you
476.44 - have gotten that shift in Risk profile
478.84 - that can just ify counting kind of
480.56 - unique occurrences differently but for
482.44 - normal just regular typical market
484.44 - conditions usually how we would kind of
486.88 - like Define that or Define the strength
488.36 - of counting something as An Occurrence
490.04 - is the passage of time because a lot of
492.12 - these risk factors are driven by
493.60 - duration and changes in market
495.24 - conditions which kind of take time to
496.68 - propagate make sense yes okay so let's
499.40 - go to the next slide
501.96 - so so this was kind of an interesting um
505.08 - study I was talking with Jacob about
506.44 - this last night to get his thoughts I
507.64 - was going to use Theta to kind of
509.12 - measure this but um he's like yeah yeah
511.20 - maybe just look at sort of like how the
514.52 - p&l variance or the p&l standard
516.12 - deviation changes depending on how you
517.64 - spread your trades out in your data set
519.52 - and I thought that was a great idea and
521.04 - you kind of see something really
522.12 - interesting here so what we're looking
523.80 - at is we calculated the p&l volatility
525.84 - so the standard deviation of pnls for 45
528.28 - DTE 16 Delta spice strangles 2013 to
530.92 - present these are held until expiration
533.40 - um and then we measured how this
535.52 - standard deviation changed depending on
538.28 - if we opened the trade every day every
540.16 - other day every third day Etc right how
542.56 - we space those trades out so this graph
544.68 - shows what those p&l standard deviations
546.80 - are depending on how we space those
548.48 - triangles out in their in this data set
550.40 - basically um so what we found is that
553.16 - the P pnl volatility ranged from 670 to
555.56 - 710 when the strangles were opened
557.20 - between one to five trading days apart
559.64 - and then it dropped to 630 so pretty
561.76 - significant drop when the strangles were
563.48 - spaced out by an average of seven
564.92 - trading days or nine calendar
567.64 - days so what what are you saying with
570.08 - this then let go to the next slide so
571.84 - there is a reason for this this sharp
574.12 - drop and that's mostly just because
575.72 - there's just this natural shift in
577.12 - expiration Cycles right after about
579.44 - seven trading days or nine calendar days
582.00 - on average right then the 45-day
585.00 - contracts from the previous cycle were
586.68 - close enough in that duration to count
588.20 - as a 45 day occurrence if that kind of
590.00 - makes sense right basically your
592.28 - expiration cycle shifted up and now
594.36 - something that was like 50 days is close
596.00 - enough to 45 days to count as another
597.52 - occurrence so this is just natural
598.60 - shifts and expiration Cycles but when we
601.16 - shifted over into expiration Cycles we
603.56 - saw a pretty significant drop in the
606.00 - variance of pnls which kind of suggests
608.96 - that spreading your occurrences out far
610.88 - enough to at the very least ensure that
613.08 - each occurrence has a unique expiration
614.88 - cycle might help with smooth out like
616.68 - smoothing out these fluctuations these
618.32 - p&l variances over time in regular
620.68 - market conditions and that time frame
622.88 - that kind of buffer time for 45-day
624.64 - contracts is about nine calendar days at
626.88 - least for
628.32 - spy kind of make
632.12 - sense yes does it I mean I didn't know
636.80 - you would come up with nine calendar
638.68 - days but sure it's kind of not that um
642.92 - surprising but it is nice to have a
644.68 - number which is nice to have a number I
646.08 - agree it's kind of nice to have a number
647.24 - like if you're like okay I want to space
648.84 - out my trades to kind of if my goal with
651.56 - getting these unique occurrences is to
653.36 - smooth out my pnls over time how many
655.40 - days should I I think that's interesting
657.16 - cuz we've never done that before that's
658.68 - a news there you're basically saying if
660.20 - you have two of the exact same trades
662.04 - nine days apart makes
663.68 - them distinct and unique occurrences
666.44 - they're P their risk profiles are
668.08 - different enough right yeah the risk
670.28 - profiles are different enough after nine
671.68 - days that they're not the exact same
673.00 - trade right so if I had 16 Delta spr 16
676.28 - Delta spy strangles right and I'm trying
678.52 - to get that duration to about 45 days if
681.80 - I'm trying to put on you know however
683.28 - many occurrences then spreading them out
685.04 - by about nine days right that's yeah
688.00 - that's that's the number yeah at least
689.60 - from this one particular backg it's a
692.08 - good thing to have Julia because we
693.36 - never went like that we would always say
695.52 - you know I don't know wait a couple of
697.52 - days or next day or you know something
699.48 - like that yeah yeah yeah we never we
700.96 - never had any context around that which
702.80 - is also fine I I got to emphasize that
704.96 - it's also fine because remember we're
706.36 - trying to we're trying to make sure that
708.40 - we're getting different risk profiles
710.56 - and that can happen over a day or two
711.92 - days I just want to be very clear we're
713.60 - talking about unique occurrences as
715.44 - opposed to just occurrences we're
717.20 - talking about unique occurrences yes
719.36 - we're if the variable that we're trying
720.68 - to optimize over is reducing smoothing
722.60 - out our p&l over time and we want to
724.72 - maybe use unique occurrences as a way to
726.72 - do that then N9 days is about again
730.28 - nuances here a lot of nuances here but
731.96 - not on average about N9 days is how much
735.88 - time to spread out occurrences by at
737.60 - least according to the study okay yeah
740.32 - yeah that's cool I like NE next slide
744.80 - yeah okay so to conclude trade small
747.40 - trade often is based on the sort of
748.64 - statistical principle that consistent
750.08 - small trades over a long period of time
751.76 - reduces p&l variance from that might
754.40 - arise from like the noise in the market
756.24 - right but if the goal is to minimize the
758.64 - impact of these short-term fluctuations
760.76 - on our strategy averages then our trade
763.00 - occurrences specifically unique
764.72 - occurrences should ideally have some
766.44 - variation in Risk profile and so one way
769.08 - that you can do this obviously like
770.68 - there's a lot of different factors that
772.16 - can cause the risk profile of a trade to
773.92 - change but in kind of like regular old
776.28 - market conditions um one way to do this
778.44 - is by spreading out occurrences far
780.36 - enough apart to ensure that each has
781.76 - sort of a unique expiration cycle and
783.88 - that's about nine days nine calendar
785.96 - days for 45-day contracts at least for
789.08 - spy good it's something different I like
792.44 - it kind of different yeah I don't want
794.56 - to discourage people from occurrences
797.28 - because like we count adjustments sure
800.56 - you know we count reentering adjustments
803.68 - opening closing whatever it is yeah we
805.92 - don't do a lot of like one of the things
808.64 - that Tony and I do that's that's
810.48 - probably that saves us a lot yeah is we
813.44 - don't like fall in love with the trade
815.76 - to the point where we say okay I put a
817.32 - trade on in the in the morning and now
819.44 - it's a dollar better this afternoon
820.76 - we're going to do more of it yeah like
822.24 - we don't think like that I know that was
823.64 - an extreme case for sure just because it
825.68 - really happens for us either so I mean
828.40 - we don't really come up with that too
829.72 - much well this is this is something that
831.56 - I got a lot of questions about like
832.92 - every time we have a live show I get
834.76 - questions about it um you know like
836.48 - emails I get emails about it which is
838.00 - like well why don't I just trade 10 puts
840.08 - right that is that 10 occurrences and I
842.48 - mean in a way that kind of is right but
844.48 - like you're really not getting the sort
846.28 - of like time diversification I guess I
848.52 - should say from spreading those trades
850.28 - out over time so if you put on a trade
852.44 - every day and market conditions for
855.08 - change for a bunch of different reasons
857.08 - um those are occurrences as we Define
859.36 - them but when we're thinking about using
862.12 - occurrences as a tool to smooth out sort
865.12 - of these short-term fluctuations then
867.84 - you know getting kind of space or
869.32 - getting a buffer time from those
870.72 - fluctuations is something that's I think
872.68 - kind of important to keep in mind but
874.60 - again this is a huge simplification this
876.16 - doesn't account for like all these
877.52 - factors that you talked about like
878.48 - adjustments and rolling and like crazy
880.56 - changes in volatility in tray for
882.64 - example like there's a whole bunch of
884.08 - factors that affect this but this is
885.36 - kind of more of just for regular old
887.28 - market conditions for Market you know
889.44 - index um options that kind ofu
892.16 - understood we get it
