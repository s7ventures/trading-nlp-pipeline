0.20 - part two understanding premium decay in
2.68 - part one we showed that the realized
4.88 - premium Decay curve is very close to the
6.76 - theoretical one for at the money spy
10.28 - options since most
12.80 - Traders except for Dr Jim since most
16.08 - Traders except for Dr Jim sell out-
18.00 - of-the money options does the actual
20.24 - out-of-the money Decay also follow
23.84 - theoretical that is the
26.92 - question let's go next
28.96 - slide it's kind of a really good piece
31.04 - it's long though unlike at the money
33.12 - options the theoretical Decay for out of
34.80 - the money options starts to decrease
36.36 - approaching expiration date so let's
38.96 - take a look at this historical data
41.52 - basically what we're going to show over
42.76 - the next bunch of
45.12 - slides is
47.16 - that there's a reason one of the reasons
50.20 - I didn't I and I'm not throwing Dr Jim
52.52 - on of the bus one of the reasons I
53.68 - didn't like the piece that he just did
55.28 - is we have mechanics and in our
57.64 - mechanics we focus on mansion out of the
60.44 - money options at 21 days or 50% we focus
64.64 - on managing at the money options um at
68.88 - let's just say 25% because because they
71.56 - Decay because the Decay rate is slower
73.68 - and you take more
75.36 - risk the reason I don't like selling in
78.24 - the- money options is because it messes
80.16 - up our
81.24 - mechanics that's fair because you have
82.92 - to use out ofth the- money mechanics and
84.64 - it doesn't make any
85.92 - sense let's go to the next slide
90.32 - um typical tasty study 45 days to
93.80 - expiration 10 years of data 16 Delta
97.08 - puts recorded the non-movement Curren is
100.16 - stock price less than a half a percent
103.04 - away from the original stock price order
105.48 - entry and let's take a look go to the
107.68 - next Slide
108.96 - John so just like the theoretical curve
112.36 - the out of- the money Theta tapers off
115.00 - approaching expiration this is due to
117.20 - the low probability of an option being
119.04 - in the money
120.60 - um at expiration the out of- the money
124.12 - the the out of- the money Theta tapers
127.88 - off that means when an option gets cheap
129.64 - it just kind of sits there sure because
131.72 - nobody wants to sell it's not worth
133.00 - selling yes put that way the risk reward
135.04 - the risk reward does is isn't there
136.52 - let's go next do move in either
137.68 - direction for or against right
140.44 - yeah how does pure premium Decay look
143.16 - for variety of Deltas so we'll look at
147.04 - Theta Decay for 510 16 30 and 50 Delta
150.64 - wide puts Delta puts if we hold the
152.92 - Delta constant on a percentage basis the
155.88 - further out- of-the money options Decay
157.72 - faster than the at the money options and
159.68 - then they taper so you can see here the
162.20 - further out of the money options Decay
164.48 - the fastest the at the money options
166.60 - Decay you know the the at the money
169.24 - options Decay much slower that's why if
172.08 - you did this with in the money options
173.52 - it would be incredibly confusing right I
176.04 - mean you know it would look like it's
177.96 - inverted you can see here the speed of
180.00 - the add of money options versus the 50
181.52 - Delta option the reason that we show you
184.16 - this graph is because now you understand
187.84 - why well I mean you're beginning to
190.80 - understand why we manag the 50 Delta
193.84 - differently than we managed the the 510
196.72 - 6 510 16 20 Delta even the 30 Delta
201.28 - let's go to next slide look how much
202.88 - longer it takes to get there that's why
205.64 - over the past 10 years even though
207.96 - further further out of- the money
209.48 - options tend to reach 50% of their Max
211.36 - profit more quickly we need to consider
213.72 - the differences in premium between out
215.44 - of the money and at the money puts so
219.24 - when you look at the at the money put
221.20 - has $750 in premium when you look at the
223.40 - out of the money put like the 16 Delta
225.20 - is
225.96 - $23 so the average money you make per
228.24 - trade is significantly less and the
230.84 - return on your investment is
232.68 - significantly less however when you
235.76 - manage a 21 days um the same trend as
240.08 - exiting trads with profits are exceed
242.00 - 50% it's it's it looks very similar so
244.88 - like you had the 750 213 and then you
248.12 - have the 134 61 it's almost the same
250.44 - instead of 150 it's 133 instead of 75
253.40 - it's 67 so on a nominal basis the at the
257.16 - money options collect much more premium
258.92 - per day yeah of course you're taking a
260.92 - lot more risk this is just the this is
264.28 - the symmetrical nature of trading
266.96 - options you take more risk you make more
269.52 - money
270.56 - Mone which is a perfect math model which
272.92 - is the way it should be a lot of time in
275.68 - other models or other places you're
277.32 - taking more risk you're not getting
279.40 - compensated with the reward if you were
281.32 - right that's exactly right that's why we
283.56 - like this
285.80 - um let's go to next slide so by
290.12 - controlling for Del Delta we can
292.96 - quantify the direct contribution of
294.68 - theta to a trade's p&l return on
296.88 - investment and premium to collect
300.16 - out of the money options reach their 50%
302.92 - winner Target much quicker than at the
304.96 - money options which is why we manage
307.68 - strangles early 21 DTS or 50% and
311.60 - straddles at 25% of their Max profit
316.32 - that's why people that sell in the money
318.44 - options you get a little confused
319.92 - because you think you should be managing
321.96 - much earlier but you're really trading
323.36 - the premium right not the actual you're
326.80 - trading all these numbers are based on
329.12 - extra
330.24 - right not intrinsic right okay just to
333.36 - be clear
