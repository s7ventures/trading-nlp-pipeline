0.04 - I heard you mention yesterday something
2.60 - about buying Black Swan protection and
5.24 - if one were to buy Black Swan protection
7.68 - what Delta would you use I think anybody
10.56 - who's lived through sort of 2008 2009
14.36 - always values their Black Swan
16.72 - protection I've probably lost out on a
18.92 - lot of money in the bull market for the
20.68 - last 14 years because I lived and ran
24.12 - money through that phase I mean it can
26.44 - be if you're talking about Black Swan
28.60 - protection you're probably talking three
30.36 - to five Deltas as cheap as you want to
32.28 - go because technically what Black Swan
34.48 - protection is is it's unquantifiable
37.04 - Delta it doesn't matter what you buy
39.16 - whatever you buy is going to work if it
40.92 - if that happens personally I do not like
43.60 - this and I do not buy Black Swan
45.64 - protection I keep my position size small
48.24 - and that's how I protect myself
