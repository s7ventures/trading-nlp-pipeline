0.04 - BTO is a Bitcoin Futures ETF so I went
4.68 - and Googled it and what they do in bit
7.16 - which I had no idea is that they have a
9.92 - monthly dividend and bitto is not an
12.72 - expensive stock let me just see $24.75
15.52 - it's 2475 and they pay a $1 dividend and
20.64 - a
22.00 - 45% return the last 12 months they paid
24.80 - out almost $13 in dividends so if
27.88 - Bitcoin goes higher they out capital
31.20 - gains because it's a Futures product
