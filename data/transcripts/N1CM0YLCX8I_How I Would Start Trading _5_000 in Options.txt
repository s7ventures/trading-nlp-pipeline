0.04 - how to start trading with a smaller
1.40 - account so we asked the research team to
3.32 - put together something a little
5.32 - different for today we have no
7.68 - unfortunately we have no um Chris beio
10.28 - today because he's on the road for the
12.24 - holiday so we got two pieces of research
14.12 - actually three pieces of research today
16.52 - so as we enter the new year and more
18.92 - Traders start to enter the market it's
20.56 - important to look at how to start
22.80 - trading with a smaller account a lot of
25.16 - people um ask us how to get started we
28.36 - have all these you know all these
30.52 - different videos I did one with my
32.12 - daughter case Tony did one with his son
34.52 - Nick not to mention hundreds of others
37.12 - called where do I start um but we've
40.32 - been doing stuff over the years to get
41.80 - people start in this business and it's
43.40 - just an insane number as insane amount
46.32 - of content we've probably created more
49.68 - options content than I'm going to go on
52.20 - a limb here and say we've created more
53.64 - option content than everybody else in
56.00 - the world combined over the last 14
58.44 - years as we BAS basically created you
61.28 - know over somewhere between 10 and 14
64.32 - hours a day for 14 straight years I
66.60 - don't think anybody's even close so with
69.88 - the markets trading at all-time highs it
72.00 - may be easy to overlook the the scope of
75.08 - stock market growth over the last few
76.48 - years in fact Over The Last 5 Years the
78.76 - S&P has almost doubled the NASDAQ has
80.68 - more than doubled the Russell has
82.32 - increased by about 800 points Market's
84.44 - going up a lot sure let's go to next
86.84 - slide so as asset prices rise new
89.28 - Traders find themselves more Capital
92.00 - constrained than they than when they
94.20 - first started out because Capital
95.40 - requirements trade options increased
97.32 - proportionately um to asset prices
100.28 - that's one of the parts of this business
103.08 - I mean you know they as as the market
105.52 - goes higher things get a little bit more
107.12 - expensive to do because everything's
108.40 - based on a percentage of of notional
111.44 - value so unless the stock splits bring
114.36 - its prices lower um we need to find
117.04 - underlyings and strategies to trade and
118.80 - keep Capital requirements low and um the
122.36 - probability of profit high so you know
125.36 - what we found and we put some fun stuff
127.40 - up here in December of 2019 the cues
130.36 - were 211 now they're
132.20 - 531 meta which is Facebook of course you
135.20 - know was 200 it's 600 Netflix was 300
138.56 - and change it's 900 even McDonald's you
141.96 - know was 200 it's 300 just showing you
144.24 - just some of the growth over the last
145.80 - five years has been insane right and we
149.24 - we you you mentioned McDonald's there
151.28 - just because you know it's a multi
154.48 - hundred billion dollar company that
156.52 - usually does is not like a growth stock
159.40 - it's more of like a dividend paying slow
163.12 - and steady type stock even that Stock's
165.40 - up 30% or
167.72 - whatever um we're going to go to the
170.60 - next slide so simply adding long Wings
173.56 - to like a short strangle for example
175.32 - might not be the only answer even though
177.72 - we still have access to the finders
179.12 - trades be aware that a fixed width
181.88 - spread or an iron condor in an
183.20 - underlying that increased significantly
186.04 - in price sees its pop it's probability
189.08 - profit greatly reduced so what do we do
191.96 - so in order to get the same pop that you
193.64 - had in
194.56 - 2019 your um your wings on a 20 Delta
198.64 - for example iwm iron Condor need to be
200.64 - $20 wide making it much less feasible
203.52 - for smaller accounts partially due to
206.00 - the added skew all that means is you
208.60 - know given how much the market red up it
210.92 - you have to get kind of wide to get the
212.56 - same amount of credit you have to get
213.88 - kind of wide to get the same probability
216.52 - of profit we we put it up here just so
218.56 - you can see with pop in
221.32 - 2019 a iwm iron condor in December was
224.92 - had a 69% pop and if we did the same
228.12 - iron Condor um five years later it's
231.60 - 61% okay you know that's 15% reduction
235.44 - in probability profit for the same exact
237.48 - trade so let's go forward a cool study
240.32 - these guys did yeah they did yeah so to
242.28 - answer the Dilemma it's actually not as
244.00 - complex as it seems due to the beauty of
246.52 - product indifference tasty is all about
249.24 - product indifference it's it's like
250.80 - we're agnostic to product we don't care
252.44 - if it's if it's an ETF if it's an equity
255.20 - we we don't care what it is could be a
256.88 - Future's option doesn't matter so in
258.72 - other words as long as the product you
260.00 - find is liquid that's the key liquidity
262.68 - has a it has a tight bit ass bread the
264.96 - name of the company doesn't matter so
266.56 - much when it comes to the risk reward of
268.12 - the trade so we look look at some assets
270.48 - below that have relatively High implied
272.24 - volatility and a high IV Rank and
274.48 - they're liquid with almost four stars
276.48 - three and a half to four stars they're
278.40 - reasonably priced and the iron Condors
280.28 - or even strangles may be doable for
283.00 - Traders with smaller accounts so just to
285.36 - show you we put up here a couple of
286.84 - names like fxi the Chinese ETF ewz the
289.96 - Brazilian ETF um GDX a gold mining ETF
294.40 - and SLV these are all inexpensive stocks
296.84 - now my favorite as far as liquidity goes
299.52 - um
300.28 - but we have positions on in GDX and fxi
303.08 - right now but so so we do trade them and
306.00 - you can see for strangles Capital
308.92 - required is a very small amount of money
311.60 - on a relative basis $500 $300 $500 you
315.12 - know $400 so they're doable for most
317.96 - account sizes let's go to next slide
320.20 - small accounts tend to be Capital
322.60 - constrained from doing undefine risk
324.12 - trades which is why tasty Traders often
327.28 - opt for Define risk trades how can we
329.72 - strategically choose undefined R
331.44 - strategies like strangles and short puts
333.08 - or short calls whatever so they would be
335.16 - available to smaller accounts
336.32 - maintaining the benefits of the
338.04 - undefined risk trades um and obviously
341.88 - this has a lot to do with implied
343.32 - volatility so next slide Beth for both
345.84 - low and high IV underlyings using a
348.00 - defined risk strategy will cost between
349.84 - 20 and 40% of the credit received
352.12 - depending on implied volatility so we
354.28 - gave an example here of two stocks Delta
356.08 - Airlines and CMG we're trying to go all
357.96 - over the place with this Delta Del with
359.92 - a high IV CMG with a low IV and we
362.52 - showed you kind of just the difference
364.16 - in um because they're both about the
366.20 - same price 61 or $62 so you got a lot
369.60 - more credit with Delta because the um
373.96 - I'm sorry you got a yeah you got a much
376.88 - bigger credit on a one standard
378.92 - deviation strangle you got a much bigger
381.12 - credit on a one standard deviation iron
382.76 - Condor because it had higher implied
385.32 - volatility and so you end up with just
388.36 - you know big more
390.52 - credit we're just High impli volatility
393.24 - you're saying right yeah yeah just due
394.56 - to higher implied volatility yeah same
396.32 - Delta nothing Delta same price right yep
400.12 - same Delta same price twice as much
401.84 - money right okay let's go to next
406.04 - slide so when using undefined risk
408.76 - trades in low implied volatility stocks
410.52 - you get a sizable increase in buying
412.36 - power required however in high implied
414.96 - volatil stocks the percentage increase
416.48 - in buying power is much less allowing
419.24 - you to used more undefined risk trades
422.12 - so we gave another example here this is
424.56 - using the same two stocks this time we
426.92 - looked at a strangle versus an iron
428.32 - Condor and it's Delta and CMG again and
431.04 - you can see the iron Condor is going to
432.40 - use the same amount of money but the
435.96 - difference here is the one standard
437.08 - deviation strangle and the percent
439.32 - change in buying power just you're using
441.92 - more buying power is the
443.92 - point um so the these are these are
448.08 - buying power reductions this is not
449.68 - credit received buying power so the
451.64 - strangle in CMG requires more money
454.60 - because the credit you receive is less
456.60 - the strangle in the percent change is 58
461.04 - compared to 36 in CMG so use a lot more
464.60 - money because of the low implied
466.40 - volatility where is when you do an iron
467.52 - condo it's gonna be the same sure sure
469.68 - iron condo is never going to change
470.88 - because it's defined risk let's go to
472.88 - next slide you know what you will
474.48 - receive a little bit more credit on the
476.24 - higher implied volatility of that's
478.24 - that's why that's why the requirement
479.68 - lower right so some of the takeaways
482.88 - many popular assets have more than
484.12 - doubled in price over the Last 5 Years
486.12 - increasing the difficulty for new
487.52 - Traders with limited Capital so Define
489.96 - risk strategies cost 25 to 40% of the
493.84 - credit received however undefined risk
496.80 - in high IV stocks offers a Better Credit
499.44 - divide credit over buying power
501.12 - reduction ratio and a smaller buying
504.12 - power reduction increases making
506.60 - undefined risk trades more feasible for
508.76 - smaller accounts
510.16 - and new Traders should focus on product
512.12 - indifference prioritizing High liquidity
515.32 - moderate to high implied volatility high
517.56 - pop and low Capital requirements over
521.00 - specific asset names it's a pretty heavy
524.56 - study for an intro study but I think it
526.96 - covers so much good stuff it's really
529.00 - well done
