0.08 - we decided to do a four four-part series
2.08 - on earnings every Monday this is part
4.72 - two regarding around earnings and we're
7.32 - we're spreading it off in case it's like
9.24 - an IRA account or in case you have
10.76 - limited capital or making it into an
12.28 - iron Condor so obviously if you do an
14.28 - iron Condor you're going to have a
15.40 - results that are slightly slightly less
18.24 - than if you did a strangle because
19.56 - strangle more risk more reward um
21.76 - strangle more risk higher probability of
23.84 - success so if we spread everything off
26.16 - it's going to be a little bit less risk
27.88 - so the the odds go down a little bit but
30.24 - still I think there's a positive return
32.96 - so let's take a look let's do it and
34.88 - like I said get your helmet on for this
36.36 - one during earnings announcements
37.56 - Traders employee strategies like
38.96 - undefined risk strangles and defin risk
41.68 - like iron Condors to leverage in to
44.20 - leverage increased volatility each
46.12 - strategy presents a different risk
47.96 - reward profile and so let's take a look
50.96 - the efficient market hypothesis says
53.64 - that asset prices reflect all available
55.72 - information including earnings data thus
57.88 - a key question how do earnings and an MS
60.84 - influence a portfolios risk reward
63.76 - Dynamics across various strategies
65.80 - defined and undefined how can Traders
68.32 - optimize these strategies in an
70.92 - efficient market let's take a look six
73.48 - years same as we did last time Apple
75.96 - Netflix Amazon and Tesla 16 Delta
79.32 - strangle and a 16 Delta strangle and a
83.04 - 1016 Delta iron Condor so means in both
85.84 - we sold the same option we just bought a
88.00 - 10 Delta in the iron Condor we calcul
89.92 - calulated the average p&l the premium
91.52 - the buying power the return on Capital
93.08 - compared the results let's see what we
95.04 - got and there's a lot of stuff here I
96.92 - promise you this was the deploying the
99.32 - strangle um without anything else if you
102.92 - remember this is from last week this is
105.16 - just in six years looking at four
108.04 - different stocks how does this 16 Delta
110.76 - strangle work works pretty good you know
113.00 - 70 78% chance of success how does it
116.56 - work with the ratio of average p over
118.52 - buying power not bad
120.52 - 02028 how about premium collected how
122.84 - about return on investment and the
124.48 - return on investment it's again this is
127.44 - over a six-year period um for each each
131.36 - individual you know each individual
133.08 - trade it's okay um Tesla was actually a
136.28 - loser the other ones were small winners
138.68 - across the board earnings trades
140.40 - remember have the smallest amount of
141.92 - edge so just keep that in mind let's go
144.20 - to next slide so now what we're going to
145.88 - do is we're going to take a look and
147.20 - we're going to look at just solely at
148.92 - earnings using a strangle not not
151.68 - defined risk but using undefined risk we
154.68 - went this is stuff we did last week too
156.92 - we just looked at a strangle and the win
158.48 - rates all stayed High the ratio stayed
161.24 - High the premium collector was decent
163.04 - and the return on investment worked in
166.04 - apple but didn't work in Netflix Amazon
167.80 - and Tesla and those numbers were net
169.92 - negative numbers if you just did the
171.36 - strangle just on earnings so the results
173.56 - are very mixed burnings even with even
176.24 - with a 72 or 73% probability of profit
179.40 - the result are mixed let's go to next
181.24 - slide so for a strangle the return on
184.16 - investment is potentially high but
187.24 - that's when you're timing is optimal but
189.08 - the risk of large moves um the non-
192.00 - earnings periods were steady but a
194.28 - little bit lower than you know than than
196.88 - the earnings periods with less dramatic
199.08 - price action so here we summarized
201.92 - everything for you in the other columns
203.92 - but let's go to the next slide so here
205.60 - we go to an iron Condor and this is
207.20 - taking a little bit of risk off the
209.08 - table but we need to see how these came
212.24 - out um in in all these different periods
216.04 - for these particular stocks now remember
218.40 - this is a six-year this was a six-year
221.84 - like very strong bull market and these
224.20 - are very strong NASDAQ stocks Apple
227.40 - Netflix Amazon and Tesla the win rates
229.72 - were fine the ratio of p&l over buying
232.80 - power that's not so good that number
234.72 - came out negative the premium collected
236.56 - was obviously positive and the return on
238.88 - investment in these cases was negative
241.24 - now again we were in a very strong bull
244.64 - market and you did not get paid even
247.32 - with a high win rate the losses wiped it
249.72 - out let's go to next slide so here we
251.92 - present the results solely on earnings
254.96 - data which is a little different than
256.60 - all the data combined now the earnings
258.68 - data the return on investments actually
260.80 - were except for Apple so for Netflix
263.16 - Amazon and Tesla it's actually a little
264.52 - bit worse for Apple it's positive the
267.44 - the the win rate dropped a lot the
270.24 - ratio of average p&l um over buying
273.28 - power this time it turned positive which
276.12 - before it was negative much that's due
277.88 - to Apple but also Tesla and Amazon were
279.84 - positive and the premium collected was
281.56 - all obviously positive um and the return
284.04 - on investment that's the scary thing it
286.84 - was good in apple but it was negative in
288.52 - the other ones so this is a very mixed
292.28 - bag of tricks when I say I don't love
294.44 - earnings trades bat there's a reason for
296.64 - me when I say that and I think you're
298.24 - looking at the reason like oh we just
300.32 - got filled at bonds got filled buying
302.16 - bonds at four I don't love that um but
305.48 - Netflix Amazon and Tesla over the last 8
307.76 - years had a negative return for earnings
310.00 - and that's why it's tough to play those
311.56 - for earnings trades and apple it's tough
314.08 - I totally agree I've been very selective
316.16 - trading earnings if if at all uh when
319.08 - they come out I've been doing well with
320.64 - post earnings trades uh but earnings
322.88 - Trad themselves un let volatility is
324.36 - extremely high and it's very liquid I
326.60 - try to avoid it well looks like Netflix
328.72 - sold off a little bit post earnings
330.28 - today after being up initially oh oh the
333.52 - other stock I was trying to think of
334.52 - this morning was Taiwan semiconductor
336.00 - they had earnings and they they out
337.64 - kicked their coverage too yes so the
339.68 - earnings have not been that great this
341.48 - cycle at all let's go to the next slide
343.64 - so here's where we summarize the iron
345.88 - Condor and I'm not going to read through
347.16 - all of this but their return on
348.88 - investment is potentially High minus 9%
352.36 - to plus 9% if the timing is optional but
355.88 - there's the risk of large moves of
357.20 - course and in non-earning periods it's a
359.92 - little steadier but again a little bit
362.08 - lower with um very with less dramatic
365.16 - price action let's go to next slide so
367.76 - and these are very subjective too a
369.88 - strangle can outperform an iron Condor
371.44 - around earnings due to its greater
372.64 - benefit from implied volatility crush
375.00 - and a wider profit range however
377.12 - strangle carries more risk the stock
379.12 - moves significantly while iron Condor
381.20 - has defined risk it's a balance between
383.72 - higher potential profit and greater
385.40 - protection you know um these numbers are
389.68 - are rough and when we broke it down on
391.76 - the top on the biggest five stocks like
393.80 - here you can see this has been a
395.76 - challenge in the last eight years with
398.72 - tech stocks specifically Netflix um we
401.84 - picked the really tough ones you know
403.96 - Netflix and Google um Apple's been good
407.56 - as it gets a little more mature it gets
408.92 - a little easier so Apple's been good but
411.24 - net Netflix and and Amazon those are
414.80 - tough they've been tough um avoid large
418.60 - moves by focusing on stocks where you
420.28 - don't expect massive shifts High implied
422.72 - volatility often signals potential
424.72 - volatility so check historical earnings
427.08 - reactions you know this stuff's all very
429.72 - much common sense but the key here is
431.96 - key position size is small to manage the
434.32 - prizes that can they can move the market
437.24 - unpredictably during earnings yeah I
440.20 - just be careful I mean you know
442.20 - sometimes earnings are very attractive
444.36 - somebody wrote me this morning and said
445.84 - hey I'm just going to buy a bunch of
447.44 - Premium before the earnings and I'll
448.84 - sell it I mean to buy it two weeks
450.44 - before and sell it out a week you know a
451.92 - week or three days ority expands keeps
454.88 - up with as it expands and I'm like
456.56 - they're like how does that sounds a
457.68 - strategy I'm like well it works
458.92 - sometimes it doesn't work other times
460.32 - it's about a 50/50 crapshoot earnings
462.24 - are very much a crapshoot very much I
464.88 - think that I think they're almost a
466.00 - directional play if anything at all yeah
469.12 - uh for for them yeah no I totally agree
471.48 - um and you know we have triy to avoid in
473.96 - earnings um stocks that aren't going to
475.96 - have large moves by maybe you know
477.84 - avoiding Pharmaceuticals avoid something
479.92 - that doesn't have you know tight liquid
481.96 - markets doing something with defined
483.68 - risk if markets are a little bit wider
485.76 - so you know there are ways to mitigate
488.16 - the risk without avoiding them altoe but
490.68 - for me earnings earnings are just an
492.68 - event that passes in a day and you know
494.44 - business is usual the next day that's
495.92 - the way I like to look at
