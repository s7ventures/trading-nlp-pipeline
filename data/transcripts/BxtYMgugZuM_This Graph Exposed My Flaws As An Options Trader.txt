0.20 - is it normal quick question is it normal
3.24 - for the SPX to be cheaper than its
7.00 - corresponding Futures what is the SPX
9.08 - right now SPX is about uh trading Clos
13.32 - at 70
14.76 - 5751 so it's about $50 lower than where
18.20 - &ps are right now it's about $50 lower
20.80 - SPX okay so is it normal for the SPX to
23.52 - be cheaper than it's Futures what do you
24.96 - think normal normal like Abby normal
28.44 - they're the exact same thing right
30.80 - yes so the reality here is that it's
32.68 - going to depend on interest rates it's
34.20 - more normal in the past than it has been
36.88 - recently so it's really just a function
39.36 - of cost to carry that is correct okay
41.68 - the cost to carry of the synthetic
43.60 - equivalent of the stock position that
45.24 - you would have I agree it is just it is
47.68 - just about cost to carry let's go next
49.92 - let's go to the first slide it's a
51.20 - little heavy here but we thought this
53.04 - might help people because they're the
54.28 - exact same product the S&P 500 and the
56.68 - spies and the and the es but why are
59.40 - they different in price well the S&P 500
61.60 - is the most popular index watched by
63.52 - investors all around the world there are
64.80 - multiple underlying instruments that
66.48 - track it closely including the SPX the
69.64 - spy and the es Futures the SPX and the
72.72 - es Futures are priced very similar the
75.12 - fundamental difference is that SPX is a
77.24 - cash index and cannot be traded whereas
79.00 - the es represents the Futures Contract
81.48 - which is tradable okay next slide not
84.16 - sure what little s smps up on the day
86.48 - NASDAQ actually up on the day NASDAQ
88.80 - down on the day by two oh it was just up
91.36 - as of October 8 basically unchanged on
93.04 - the overall Mark yeah as of October 8th
94.64 - es is trading at a premium to SPX
96.44 - roughly 47 points higher this raises the
98.72 - question is the es always priced higher
100.60 - than SPX or is this an outlier event so
103.56 - why not an outlier event let's let's
105.04 - throw that it's not an outlier okay so
106.72 - why does this discrepancy exist if they
108.64 - both track the same basket of stocks and
111.48 - let's take a look like we said it's
113.04 - going to be all about cost to carry next
114.84 - slide please John the difference
116.36 - represents the cost to carry priced into
118.64 - the Futures and dividends which includes
121.20 - dividends on the S&P 500 stocks and the
123.60 - interest rate cost to finance the
125.04 - portfolio for the duration of the
126.20 - Futures Contract the reason we're doing
127.80 - this segment is just to point out to you
129.56 - that there is in the SP there the the
133.12 - dividends in the SPX the Dividends are
136.72 - no dividend SPX so let's yeah they're
138.60 - they're already built in but the but the
140.84 - equivalent stock position the cost to
143.24 - carry the equivalent stock position is
145.16 - not in the es uh's buying some at 121
149.24 - again back to 121 in the es the the cost
153.24 - to carry and the interest the the the
156.16 - cost to carry and the Dividends are
157.88 - built into to the price of the actual
159.32 - future in the Spy the cost to carry the
162.36 - stock and the Dividends are neither of
164.64 - those are built in let's go next slide
166.32 - so because the es trades close to the
168.52 - expected forward value at settlement
170.92 - date the formula is as follows that's
173.32 - the S formula and um we we laid the
176.40 - whole thing out the risk free rate the
177.60 - dividend yield and the time to maturity
179.36 - let's go next next slide think about it
180.84 - if it wasn't factored in there would be
183.04 - an ARB there this is why there is no ARB
185.08 - there that formula right there is why
186.60 - there is no ARB in this play whether es
189.80 - trades at a discount or premium to SPX
192.04 - depends on the relationship between
193.92 - interest rates and the dividend yield
195.48 - just think about it this way if the
197.24 - interest rate exceeds the dividend yield
198.88 - the es will likely trade at a premium on
200.72 - the other side if the dividend yield is
203.28 - higher than the interest rate then es
205.96 - will trade at a discount and right now
208.20 - the interest rate exceeds the dividend
210.12 - yield so the es trades at a premium for
213.04 - the last couple of years the dividend
215.16 - yield which is like I think it's like
217.16 - 2.6% or something was higher than
219.88 - interest rates so the es will trade it a
222.28 - discount but right now the dividend
224.08 - yield let's say it's the same 2.5% just
227.24 - I'm just guessing and the dividend yield
229.08 - is four then it's going to trade you
231.64 - know then es will likely trade at a
233.40 - premium let's go next slide which is
235.08 - where we are today in the past 30 years
237.08 - there have been four major periods where
238.48 - the es was priced higher than the SPX
242.48 - okay for only four periods in 30 years
244.80 - let's go next slide good when you see
246.28 - the visual that way these periods
247.80 - coincide with times when the Federal
249.64 - Reserve increased interest rates
252.20 - confirming that fluctuations in interest
254.64 - rates play an important role in creating
256.92 - discrepancies between the es and the SPX
260.80 - so again when you know this this all
263.44 - happens when when the when the FED
266.28 - raises rates and the cost to carry is
268.88 - greater than the dividend yield that's
270.80 - when you get the that that kind of
272.84 - inversion M let's go to the next slide
275.68 - in June of 2022 the Federal Reserve
277.92 - announced a shocking 75 basis point rate
280.44 - hike for the first time in almost three
281.76 - decades which immediately resulted in an
284.24 - increase in the es to SPX spread we're
287.36 - just giving you some examples here again
289.32 - there's nothing there's nothing here
290.76 - that's tradable just give me the reason
292.76 - why yeah there's nothing here that's
295.76 - necessarily tradeable it's just the
297.20 - reason why buy back more of that spread
298.84 - you put on buying back more of the
302.28 - 7577 yeah yeah those were just some
304.32 - trades we made the other day just to try
306.12 - to take advantage of to try to take a
308.60 - little bit of advantage of crude oil
310.96 - yeah so when I do that what I do then is
312.76 - I roll down your calls yeah roll down my
315.24 - calls to keep my other stuff in line
317.00 - very Dynamic there s enough let's go to
319.08 - the next slide so here are the
320.96 - statistics showing the percentage of
322.72 - times the es is higher than the SPX
324.56 - these results are consistent with our
326.20 - previous discussion however since the
327.60 - FED has started reducing interest rates
329.76 - is expected to continue doing so we
331.44 - might observe a tightening of the spread
333.84 - in the future so the percent of the time
335.92 - that the es is higher than the SPF and
337.52 - again this is not something that's
338.76 - tradable it's just something so you
340.40 - understand when you look at the numbers
342.08 - kind of what's going on for the last 30
344.04 - years 54% of the time since 2008 25% of
347.20 - the time but since 2022 85% of the time
351.04 - because we've been in a rate hike
352.84 - environment for the last three years um
355.28 - so just to give you you know I mean if
357.44 - that helps you know put some context
359.96 - because what happens is people roll the
361.40 - futures from one month to the next and
363.12 - they're why am I paying for this or I
364.68 - used to do this at a discount or why am
366.16 - I doing this why am I paying for this
368.32 - now when I used to do it a discount or
369.48 - why am I doing this at a discount I used
370.64 - to pay for it that's all it explains it
372.40 - let's go to next slide so for takeaways
374.68 - the es and the SPX both represent the
376.64 - S&P 500 but they can trade at slightly
378.76 - different prices due to the cost of of
380.52 - carry in Futures Trading the gap between
382.48 - these two prices is influenced by the
384.08 - relationship between interest rates and
385.68 - dividend yields however this Gap doesn't
388.12 - necessarily indicate Arbitrage
390.36 - opportunities as everything has already
392.08 - been priced in and if you see interest
393.76 - rates go back to two and a half and
395.12 - yields are dividend yields are two and a
396.80 - half then thing is going to trade
397.76 - exactly the same price exactly
