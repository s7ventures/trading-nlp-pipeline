0.16 - intraday implied volatility and zero DT
3.00 - success this is part of our zero DT
4.80 - series are you ready I am ready or
7.52 - little zero DT talk I'm ready okay bring
11.04 - it on let's do it be should be right in
13.28 - front of you Tom the Zer DT markets in
15.64 - the right underlyings are incredibly
17.60 - liquid and fast moving demanding that
19.88 - zero DT Traders be some of the most
21.64 - attentive and active Traders this degree
24.24 - of Market awareness means constantly
26.00 - looking for signs to adjust positions
27.96 - one of the most important Market
29.04 - statistics for short premium success is
31.32 - implied volatility remember we talked
33.28 - about the vix one day yes where do you
35.12 - think it is today that's why I didn't do
36.68 - a 0 DT 866 it's probably still in the E
39.44 - handle 866 how have zero short premium
43.48 - trades performed when looking at
45.60 - intraday IV changes and how can we
48.84 - account for this in our mechanics I
52.16 - don't know but you got six slides that
53.44 - going to tell me we how we can that is
55.44 - correct thank you very much welcome
57.96 - let's take a look so we did a study we
59.76 - used 18 months worth of data in the zero
62.28 - DT options collected every 10 minutes we
64.84 - considered selling zero DT triangles 102
68.16 - and $30 out of the money not Deltas out
70.56 - of the money we then okay because this
72.84 - is kind of the key we then examined the
74.60 - change and implied volatility as
75.88 - measured by the implied volatility from
78.20 - Market open until noon we contrast to
80.96 - the performance of IB being up or down
83.16 - note that due to price or IV
85.24 - anti-correlation this is very similar to
87.68 - asking if the market is up or down does
90.12 - that make sense to you it does okay and
92.24 - the reason that we said this is because
95.48 - there are when you think about
97.72 - volatility okay if volatility goes up
100.16 - the Market's going down if volatility
101.60 - goes down the Market's going up so it is
103.68 - reasonable to assume that when you look
106.16 - at this study today if you look at
108.52 - volatility you can also assume which way
110.20 - the Market's going okay meaning that if
112.56 - the Market's going if these positions
114.92 - work better when volatil is Contracting
116.60 - then you want an up Market okay I say
119.12 - that a lot when I do my podcast on what
120.88 - you think volatility is going to do is
123.16 - going to influence the position that you
124.84 - put on too for sure okay just looking to
127.24 - see if there's anything crazy here I
128.76 - don't see it so let's continue with this
132.56 - slide all right so a bunch of stuff here
135.36 - Beth and there's a lot of stuff on these
136.76 - slides and remember these are 10 20 and
140.08 - $30 wide strangles and the difference
143.52 - here is that you close it early in the
145.00 - day or you roll it okay you just adjust
148.20 - it and you can see that after you look
150.72 - at these slides you're kind of think
152.56 - angles in we've talked about this zero
154.20 - dat they use a lot of buying power so I
156.20 - know they're not buying the wings but we
158.20 - would typically buy the wing you could
159.76 - sure but what's important here is they
162.44 - don't put the definition of rolled here
163.68 - I just want to make sure rolled means
165.76 - you are adjusting the position right not
168.24 - rolling it to the next day you ain't
169.72 - going anywhere you're not going to the
170.60 - next day though you're just okay you're
171.64 - just adjusting the position all right go
172.80 - ahead Beth go to the next slide you go
174.16 - based on the strangles and you close
176.56 - them I think you close them based on
178.68 - success we do the 20 and $30 wide so 91
182.24 - and 94 when you look at the a because
184.92 - those numbers are just too high they're
186.20 - too high not to do it the average daily
188.00 - p&l I mean when you start to look here
190.00 - at the $20 wide strangles where we live
191.88 - here it it totally makes sense C bars
194.20 - same across the board when you roll
196.04 - these things hold to the end of the day
197.68 - the the results aren't worth it just
199.68 - close it and move on simple the numbers
202.08 - the numbers literally with everything
204.00 - that we've found I mean you're going to
205.68 - have a lot more risk bringing it into
207.72 - the later hours of the day too these
209.44 - numbers speak for themselves just put
211.76 - the position on close them out that's
213.88 - your best play don't roll them don't
215.52 - don't get too cute unless you have you
217.28 - roll them if you have to not not not
218.96 - because you're doing it offensively the
220.44 - Sears pretty much stays the same when we
222.68 - look at this this is when implied
225.88 - volatility no that's overall okay good
227.84 - perfect that's it regardless of implied
230.52 - volatility now we're looking at this
232.36 - implied volatility contracts so when
234.48 - implied volatility cont tracks the other
236.44 - side to that is that this is Market
238.36 - going higher Okay so the Market's going
240.48 - higher your win rate is really high I'm
242.68 - looking at the middle one the 20 Delta
244.24 - closed triangles that's the one I've
246.04 - highlighted 20 Delta wide not sorry
249.84 - 20 wide strangles $20 outside the money
253.48 - basically $20 away from the at the money
255.88 - strangles I'm looking at this the win
258.44 - rate I'm looking at the average daily
260.52 - p&l okay even if you adjust it still
263.04 - makes a little money and and not that to
266.16 - the $30 wide it's not bad either it's
268.44 - still solid the $30 wide but I'm just
270.56 - losing the 20 cuz we tend to be at the
272.24 - 20 those numbers work this is when the
274.20 - market goes higher and implied
275.52 - volatility contracts do the $10 wide you
277.72 - actually when you're when you're when
279.28 - you're rolling it becomes a negative
280.88 - just too close to the money so you ins
282.56 - you got to be wide inside the expected
284.32 - move and this is when IV expands now
286.76 - this is gets a little scary because you
288.84 - don't know what's going to happen and
290.56 - usually in the first hour like today
292.60 - first couple of hours you had you had
293.92 - the market higher now you have it
295.64 - obviously lower but take a look at these
297.52 - numbers when IV expands inra day this is
300.08 - why we don't like holding things to the
302.04 - this is why we don't like holding things
303.56 - in general because you don't know when
304.52 - the Market's turn around there's no
306.04 - positive number here this is when the
308.00 - market turns around and goes down this
309.64 - is what makes zero DT so hard because
312.44 - when the market goes down due to the
313.92 - velocity of change meaning the velocity
316.08 - of the movement to the downside and also
317.92 - due to the IV expansion and today is a
319.88 - perfect example as the vix is was down
322.64 - this morning now it's up 25 CS the win
325.28 - rate drops from low 90s to 70% the
330.04 - average daily p&l gets crushed totally
332.28 - crushed and this is why I'm going to
334.84 - point out a couple things here this is
336.60 - why I only like to do zero days when IV
340.04 - is really high to start with because
342.32 - when IV is low you run the risk of IV
345.24 - expansion you run the risk of
347.12 - acceleration to the downside and there's
349.40 - no juice there to make up for it when
352.04 - when you have a market that is let's
355.28 - call it 50/50 to go up or down or 55 45
358.60 - whatever it is to go up or down down the
360.28 - numbers still don't play out even with a
363.12 - 94% or 92% probability of profit the
366.72 - numbers don't play out to do zero days
369.48 - in low implied volatility they just
371.48 - don't play out well you're flirting yeah
373.48 - and it's now if you put this on on a big
375.80 - down opening maybe that plays out a
377.64 - little bit better because maybe
378.56 - volatility cont tracks over the course
379.84 - of the day if it comes back a little bit
381.32 - but I don't know and we really wanted to
382.84 - do this because I wanted to show the
384.24 - difference between up markets and down
385.88 - markets changes in intraday implied
387.80 - volatility seem to heavily and
389.60 - anti-correlate with short premium Zero D
392.12 - success so as long as IV fell during the
394.68 - day the short premium trades tended to
396.12 - be winners or the short premium zero DT
398.92 - trades when Ivy expanded from open to
401.16 - noon the zero DT trades were often
403.44 - unsuccessful those was pretty obvious
405.68 - the key if you managed to have a winning
407.72 - trade despite IV expanding take your
409.44 - profits and be happy rolling to new
411.28 - strikes was a recipe for snatching
412.84 - defeat from the jaws of Victory
414.56 - essentially here this is making a very
416.92 - strong argument that one of the reasons
419.76 - that zero DT trades have been for some
422.60 - people so successful over the last 18
425.68 - months year and a half is because the
427.40 - Market's been going higher I I don't
429.12 - want to burst anybody's bubble but a
431.12 - phenomenon of the market accommodating
432.68 - right which we've always said in these
434.04 - zero days you and I have always said
435.48 - this yes there is there is no question
439.64 - that a market that grinds higher is the
443.44 - best case scenario for zero DT trades if
446.84 - you have a market that is grinding lower
450.16 - or going lower zero DT trades become
453.68 - very difficult to be profitable with so
455.52 - let's not not confuse those two
