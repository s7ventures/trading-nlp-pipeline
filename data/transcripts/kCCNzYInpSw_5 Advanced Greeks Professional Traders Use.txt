0.08 - let's do it higher order option
2.28 - Greeks sounds important the Greeks are
5.08 - metrics that we use every day in option
7.08 - trading to help us better gauge the
8.56 - health and risk of our
10.32 - portfolios technically Greeks are all
13.76 - simply first derivatives of the black
15.52 - shs model we have spoken about the main
18.08 - option Greeks many times in our research
20.52 - studies but what happens if we keep
24.20 - going deeper looking deeper into
26.20 - derivatives yeah yeah this would lead us
28.36 - to a lesser known higher order option
31.48 - Greeks derivatives of the primary Greeks
34.00 - that provide deeper insights into the
35.64 - risk and
36.68 - sensitivities of our option positions
39.76 - just keep keep on driving yep keep on
42.84 - driving I know Jacob loves these keep on
45.76 - dering now that should be a t-shirt
47.96 - let's go next
50.36 - Slide the Greeks measure the rate of
52.56 - change of a specific variable with
54.36 - respect to another variable for example
56.68 - Delta is the rate of change in options
58.60 - price relative to $1 change in the price
60.48 - of be underlying asset a second order
63.84 - derivative can be thought of as the rate
67.68 - of
69.00 - change the rate of the change of the
72.60 - rate of change let me think about that
74.92 - for a second the rate of the change of
78.60 - the rate of change yep got it in other
82.92 - words they measure how much the main
85.84 - first order Greeks change with respect
88.04 - to a specific variable this allow us to
90.32 - see when our Greeks are most optimal in
92.92 - a trade leading to better management so
95.24 - basically we're going to like prove all
97.44 - of our mechanics once again using the
99.84 - these Greeks why we uh put on specific
102.88 - trades the way we do and yeah the uh
105.72 - rate of change of the rate of change
107.24 - gives us the most optimal uh ways to put
109.96 - on the rate of change of the rate of
111.48 - change I thought it was a cool a cool
113.00 - way I do like that let's go next slide
115.60 - Beth all right so this is what we're
117.36 - talking about today charm vama
120.16 - um who thought of V it's like the worst
123.08 - name ever um color color yeah Vana and
129.04 - row yeah these are all Greek names
131.96 - apparently and you have the derivative
133.72 - with respect to so what this is
135.20 - basically saying is charm is uh Delta
138.24 - the derivative of Delta with respect to
139.96 - time BMA the derivative of Vega with
142.56 - respect to volatility and so on so that
144.52 - arrow is a fancy way of saying what
146.96 - we're deriving with respect to so that's
150.12 - why we get the second other the second
152.60 - order option Greek from got it yep so
156.44 - let's just see charm Delta vama Vega
159.52 - color
161.52 - gamma BNA Delta
165.28 - andice price with respect to interest
167.76 - rates okay got it I didn't know row was
171.28 - a second order gek I always thought it
172.56 - was the first order yeah I don't know
175.80 - because okay yeah a lot of people people
178.36 - put it in the higher order because price
180.84 - uh is with Delta always so then I mean
183.60 - you keep deriving on price again got it
185.20 - got it got it okay let's go to next
186.44 - slide
187.60 - Beth all right here's where it gets a
189.88 - little complicated let's take a look
191.24 - here what what are we doing here so I
193.04 - mean all of the so I try to keep this
195.00 - very simple when explaining all five so
196.60 - we have the formula uh the definition
199.00 - the mechanics and then a nice graph uh
201.20 - to go along with it just to explain it
203.16 - so the formula for charm that uh symbol
206.36 - uh means partial derivative so it's just
209.08 - uh going over what went over in the last
210.44 - slide so charm is uh deriving Delta with
213.40 - respect to time and uh that's a
215.48 - definition so it tracks Delta is time
217.20 - decay aing in delta neutral strategy
219.12 - management and the mechanics are it's
221.40 - that it's lowest for the at the money
222.76 - options uh and it increases as you go
224.92 - further out of the money money the
226.96 - interesting thing about this graph is
228.48 - that it's a negative y- axis so a
230.76 - negative y- axis means that the numbers
232.32 - are getting bigger as you go to the
234.00 - bottom so that's why we have higher
235.80 - charm out of the money and then lower
237.40 - charm as you get uh more in the money
239.92 - and the application for this is I mean
241.52 - this is why we trade out of the money
243.24 - options because uh Delta has a much um
247.92 - higher uh or Delta has a much higher
250.24 - Decay as you head out of the money
251.84 - versus in the at the money so you're
253.84 - able to collect more premium and on a
256.36 - relative basis on on a relative basis
258.60 - and and yeah okay I got it so lowest for
263.28 - at the money options due to the smaller
264.60 - Delta Decay increases as you go further
266.40 - out of the money option as you go
267.96 - further out of the money options all
269.52 - right makes sense the first tasty
270.96 - mechanic is this is why we trade out of
272.56 - the money got it let's
275.64 - go okay B oh okay so what do we got here
280.00 - so vomma is Vega's uh uh Vega and
283.36 - volatility so it's deriving Vega with
285.56 - respect to volatility and the important
287.60 - thing about this is that it Peaks at
289.08 - around 5 to 10 Delta and then it
291.72 - actually uh is at its lowest point at
293.96 - the at the monies and this is why we
295.68 - trade around the 16 to 35 because I
298.32 - wrote down over here volatility changes
300.68 - too much when you're out of the money
302.12 - obviously because the VMA is at its
303.32 - highest and then it changes too little
305.16 - when it's at the money uh so that's why
308.32 - we kind of trade in the middle when it's
310.72 - uh around the 16 to 35 Delta Mark so
313.40 - that's another one of our mechanics that
314.68 - comes from BMA basically because that's
317.28 - where you get the most bang for your
318.24 - buck well uh you get too much bang for
321.32 - your buck uh if you move uh at the money
324.04 - and then you get too little if you move
325.28 - out of the money because we don't want
326.60 - that's where that's where you you have
327.88 - the most you're at the most optimal
329.28 - point on
330.20 - because you don't want it to move too
331.24 - much otherwise you're going to you know
333.40 - you're going to breach all your strikes
334.68 - and you don't want it to move too little
336.08 - you're not going to collect enough
336.96 - premium so we uh take The Sweet Spot
339.12 - yeah that's good that's a good picture
341.52 - all right let's go next
343.52 - slide color color yeah that symbol the
347.92 - upside down L is the symbol for gamma if
350.92 - anybody uh wanted to know that I mean uh
353.28 - we use it sometimes but mostly we just
354.96 - write down gamma uh it so it monitors
357.12 - gamma's time change uh and this uh is
360.76 - what we know about we've talked about it
362.28 - 100 times in our research studies gamma
364.12 - increases as we get towards expiration
366.20 - this is why we manage our trades uh and
368.84 - the actual uh definition of gamma
371.32 - changing over time that line that's what
373.28 - color is so yeah well that's interesting
376.52 - yeah yeah gamma peaks near expiration
378.88 - meaning Delta's also change dramatically
381.08 - that is why we manage our trades that's
383.08 - why we manage our trades early yes
385.00 - that's why we man our trades early
387.00 - yes um exactly because
391.16 - an option can go from zero to 100 in
393.24 - basically two ticks MH got it let's go
396.00 - to next
398.68 - slide ah little van yeah van no no uh
402.88 - graph for this one but uh this one is
405.00 - Delta's volatility uh sensitivity so uh
408.84 - uh deriving uh Delta based on volatility
411.64 - and uh this is why we adjust our
413.28 - positions based on volatility shifts
414.96 - impacting Delta all this is saying is
416.88 - that being long V means that you're paid
419.60 - quickly when you're right and heard when
420.76 - you're wrong uh heard quickly when
422.52 - you're wrong and to combat this we
424.24 - diversify across strategies expirations
426.80 - and we can hedge our Deltas uh the
429.20 - reason we're doing all this is to
430.52 - basically manage our volatility
432.00 - basically so different strategies are
433.72 - optimal in different volatility
434.92 - environments different expirations and
437.48 - obviously uh hedging our Deltas also
439.24 - allows us to control our volatility as
441.16 - well yeah well the nice thing about
443.00 - tasty mechanics are that we pretty much
445.28 - sell things in high valve but we don't
446.76 - buy things in low valve so we don't have
447.92 - to worry about the one half of this
450.08 - um yeah all right good I like it yeah
453.48 - yeah yeah yeah all right next
456.72 - one and finally row I mean don't get
460.16 - scared about this actually we're going
461.48 - to get a very nice takeaway out of this
463.24 - so this is price with respect to
464.92 - interest rates so it assesses price
466.76 - sensitivity to a 1% change in the
468.64 - interest rates uh and the mechanics are
470.64 - the biggest effects so yeah interesting
473.00 - is that interest rates most affects the
474.48 - stocks that are in the banks brokerages
476.60 - mortgage and insurance companies in the
478.08 - financial sector because that's when
479.88 - going to be dealing with interest rates
481.16 - the most uh and so for uh these three
484.52 - down here I took a random sample of 10
486.72 - financial sector stocks over 10 years
488.92 - and calculated their yearly cumulative
491.00 - change in basis points uh because in
493.60 - order to see a large change you need to
495.00 - have a large amount of basis points so
496.24 - we go by the year I know many people do
498.52 - their studies with five or 10 years
500.20 - changes in basis points and we can
502.44 - actually see that if you are have a rate
504.84 - change in the year of 25 50 or 75 basis
507.64 - points uh the change in oper option
509.84 - prices is only going to be 5 cents or
511.32 - less uh if it's between 100 or 200 it's
514.20 - going to be between 5 cents and 15 cents
516.32 - if it's greater than 200 it's only going
517.96 - to be uh 15 cents or a little bit more
520.56 - so the takeaway from all of uh from this
522.56 - giant slide is that row doesn't have
523.96 - that much impact is that row does not
525.36 - have that much impact exactly so a lot
527.56 - of people think interest rates uh impact
529.76 - option prices a lot and like we need to
531.56 - be trading around the news a lot when
533.12 - the FED announces all these things but
535.00 - the reality situation is it has some
536.84 - amount of effect and you can track it
538.48 - but not that much when I first got in
540.00 - this business and rates were like you
541.40 - know 15 to 20% or over 10 there was a
546.52 - lot of price
547.80 - sensitivity in options to interest rates
551.88 - but especially in the back especially in
553.52 - the back month especially in the back
555.20 - month especially in like a lot of our
556.64 - positions we put on that stuff's been
558.92 - gone for for 25 years now yeah yeah
562.12 - right so you're right let's go to the
564.48 - last slide I think the last side yeah
566.80 - these are your takeaways okay so
568.68 - takeaways charm helps manage Delta's
571.52 - time Decay especially useful in
573.40 - optimizing delta neutral strategies or
575.12 - focusing on selling out of the money
576.60 - options OB provides insight into the
579.04 - volatility of volatility guiding traders
581.44 - to bounce Risk by choosing options in
583.28 - the 16 to
584.64 - 35 um Delta range color is crucial near
589.04 - expiration tracking gamma's time
592.32 - tracking gamma's time change to Aid in
595.92 - effectively hedging And Timely
598.00 - adjustments for Rapid Delta shifts
599.92 - manage early you don't have to deal with
601.20 - that vaana allows traders to adjust
604.24 - Delta exposure based on volatility
606.04 - changes inuring strategies remain
608.96 - aligned with market conditions again
611.36 - we're aggressively adjusting man early
613.36 - you know roll forward don't deal a lot
615.92 - with that and then row evaluates the
617.80 - impact of interest rates changes on
619.12 - option prices in this point you what
621.84 - your R is negligible focused on other
624.04 - Greeks and the more useful first order
626.60 - Greeks so I mean all of these Greeks
629.36 - proove our tasty mechanics uh and I'm
631.64 - saying row is negligible but really all
633.68 - of these are also have little impact on
637.44 - on our uh trading strategies and stuff
640.36 - like that so it's really useful to focus
642.16 - on the main your Delta Theta Vega and
644.36 - but it's still nice to know about all
645.56 - these and how it impacts if you keep
647.40 - deriving the model you can get some
648.72 - really interesting results out of it so
