0.28 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.28 - the B patista and I have a trade idea
3.76 - for you today October 3rd 2024 right
7.56 - here at downtown Chicago right here in
9.64 - the backat cave let's see what we can
11.96 - find in this market even S&P is down
15.96 - $1750 NASDAQ down
18.92 - $37.50 Russell down 19 that's a 1%
22.28 - almost 1% move of the Russell it's the
24.08 - weakest of the group and then the Dow is
26.64 - down 250 uh the second weakest of the
30.00 - four now here's where things get a
32.16 - little bit different for me you
33.88 - basically have a slightly lower opening
37.28 - here on the market &ps trading
41.20 - 5742 just off of their highs by you know
44.88 - a couple of 50 handles or so and yet
47.92 - volatility is really up ticking up to 90
51.08 - cents just now just traded up to
54.24 - 2125 which leads me to believe that
56.80 - volatility is starting to go a little
58.12 - bit higher that maybe we're going to
59.64 - have a a little bit more weakness in
61.36 - this market that's just my opinion so
63.40 - I'm going to stick away from the
64.68 - equities everything on the podcast I've
66.68 - done so far over the last couple of
68.76 - Trades um has been to try to take
71.20 - advantage of you know volatility
73.32 - expanding like we did in Iron Condor the
75.52 - volatility would have hurt us if it
76.84 - expanded um I did a a 1x3 ratio spread
80.60 - in Buu which has really been a pain in
83.96 - the uh a pain in you don't wear where
87.36 - the sun doesn't shine uh on us I'm out
89.76 - about about a dollar and a half on that
91.80 - trade now left with the 100
97.16 - uh1 20 strangle after having a
101.40 - 1x3 uh call ratio spread on with the 110
106.16 - 120 I I really went I mean I really had
109.68 - to defend this I mean when we put this
111.16 - trade on in bu and you could see all of
113.44 - these trades I have it on for around $6
115.60 - or so R A bucking change um you could
118.36 - see all of these Trad in Buu if I put it
121.56 - up here for you B I duu uh on the follow
125.84 - page so you can follow along where we
127.52 - where we did these trades look at this I
129.16 - did this uh back on uh
131.96 - 1026 and if you click on it to duplicate
134.48 - a trade we did it
136.20 - a170 um it's trading at
139.08 - 661 so yes I am out about a dollar and a
142.60 - half on this trade but had we done
145.08 - nothing we would have been out almost
147.08 - $45 on this trade so sometimes the
150.20 - adjustments help you but don't help you
152.04 - not enough what are we going to look at
153.68 - today since I think the Market's going a
155.20 - little bit lower I'm going stay away
156.36 - from uh the equity markets at all I'm
158.48 - going to go into oil that's forward slcl
162.24 - and if you take a look at oil here uh
164.08 - oil's really been bouncing around it's
166.08 - had a 4-day rally from 67 uh to where it
169.68 - is right now 7312 just off of its highs
173.12 - today of
174.92 - $73.95 I put this trade on when oil was
177.60 - up lower than $3 so you're going to be
180.48 - able to do even better than I but let's
182.60 - take a look at oil before you click the
184.60 - button make sure you know what the
187.20 - product is that you are trading now oil
190.24 - is the oil Futures these are barrels of
193.28 - oil no stock or any else here they do
196.40 - have span margining which is really um
199.88 - different if you're not used to um
202.52 - trading span margining with Futures
205.04 - options so I will go through it with you
207.44 - uh quickly but I will I will do it with
209.20 - you as best uh that I can let's take a
212.12 - look at what I'm looking to do in oil so
215.40 - um I know there's tension of the Middle
217.52 - East I think it's all play into the
219.40 - market I know they're bombing everywhere
221.00 - I get it uh buy the rumor sell the news
223.56 - is the way I like to trade but I'm going
225.12 - to go far out here I'm going to go all
227.44 - the way first of all I go to November
229.20 - with 43 days um same mechanics we like
233.16 - to put on trades around 45 days I know
235.88 - the monthly applied volatility in
237.24 - November is 50 I know the product is
239.28 - Trading
240.76 - 5256 which is about 60 cents or so lower
244.92 - than where the front month is trading
246.52 - but the front month will go away in
248.12 - about a week or so and then this will be
249.80 - the front month uh the front month will
251.64 - have a uh uh the contract instead of it
254.76 - being uh X4 will be uh will be uh Z4
260.92 - you'll see Z4 for the front month when
263.84 - it changes but the options are already
265.68 - priced and expire to these Futures let's
269.16 - take a look at November 43 days I know
271.64 - the monthly apply volatility is 50 in
273.48 - here I know the monthly apply volatility
275.12 - is closer to 60 shorter dated but I like
277.76 - time to be right on this trade not time
280.64 - to be wrong on this trade so I'm going
283.12 - to go far out with a ratio spread here
286.04 - I'm going to buy the 15ish Delta option
289.32 - you'll notice right here that the Delta
291.36 - uh is 15 I don't know why I have two in
293.08 - the money columns here I'll get rid of
294.88 - that on the next podcast I apologize um
297.84 - but you could change these to whatever
299.16 - you want let's change them to um I let's
302.28 - change it to open interest if you want
303.48 - to look at open interest let's look at
304.64 - open interest you'll see there's plenty
306.24 - of open open interest thousands and th
308.36 - thousands of open interest I'm going to
310.36 - buy the 90 call which if I'm going to do
313.92 - a ratio spread I'm slightly bearish on
317.32 - oil if I do a call ratio spread at least
319.92 - that's the way I like to do it I'm going
321.76 - to buy the 90 call I'm going to go as
324.20 - wide as I can to collect a credit I'm
326.40 - going to go up to 97 and half now I did
330.76 - this trade
332.88 - for30 which is really
335.88 - $300 in credit it's now trading for
340.32 - $340 in credit think of Cl as um uh a um
348.20 - like SPX CL is like SPX it's 10 times
351.68 - the size of what you're really used to
354.44 - seeing this is not a dollar five or a do
357.96 - six it's actually a th000 and 50 uh this
361.20 - isn't 70 it's actually 700 so we're
364.12 - doing this the mid price right now is 33
367.92 - Cent credit 33 Cent Credit Now if oil
371.60 - continues to go higher uh since you're
373.64 - selling an extra call here because we're
375.60 - doing this one buying one of the '90s
377.68 - selling two of the 97 and a halves we're
380.96 - doing it for a net credit of 33 cents I
383.24 - was able to get filled one penny off of
386.44 - mid price that's pretty typical of uh of
389.92 - these uh oil related products and uh
393.48 - these Futures options across the board
396.48 - what I like to look at you'll notice
397.92 - here that there's 2cent wide Market in
399.64 - the 90 calls now it's 3 cents 3 Cent
402.44 - wide on the market here on the 97 half
404.32 - calls so this mid price is going to be
407.00 - pretty accurate soon as it goes 2 cents
409.60 - to 3 cents it gets a little bit skewed 3
413.36 - cents 3 cents 2 cents 2 cents mid price
415.84 - is fairly accurate so if you're trading
417.64 - a Futures option or any option that has
420.76 - a very wide Market on one a very tight
423.12 - Market on the other be careful with your
425.16 - mid price go in above mid price uh and
428.80 - and try to walk the order down I would
430.92 - expect it to get filled at 32 or 31
432.76 - cents now vola now uh the products is
434.92 - going a little bit lower you can see how
436.64 - this moves so this will move around and
439.04 - it when it moves it moves a lot and look
441.56 - look the buying power I have this in an
444.20 - IRA account just to show you that you
447.12 - can do this spread in an IRA account it
449.84 - uses
450.92 - $3,700 in buying power now a lot of
453.16 - spreads that we do you know on my show
455.28 - use around $5,000 in buying power so it
457.40 - us it less but I'm going to get that's a
459.56 - caveat please don't click the button on
461.12 - another trade that you might like
462.32 - because you like the buying power
463.44 - because buying power with span margining
466.56 - can change let's just look at this trade
468.16 - first it says a 99% pop well our break
471.00 - even is well above 105 on this trade uh
475.20 - oil hasn't been over 105 that I can
478.32 - remember so my break even would mean
479.80 - that we'd have to make new highs again
481.32 - in 45 days I don't want that to happen
483.76 - just like I didn't want bu to go higher
485.64 - I'm sure we'll sell puts or do other
487.32 - things like that to adjust our Delta on
490.00 - this trade you can see the Delta is
491.32 - actually minimal uh right now it's 0.005
494.24 - but again times that by 10 because that
496.68 - would give you the real Delta so there
498.08 - is a little bit of Delta on the short
499.92 - side to this that's why I'm bearish um
502.84 - on this product that's why I'm putting
504.60 - on this type of trade other Theta is
506.40 - around $25 a day in data Decay decent
509.24 - dat
510.16 - uh Decay there and you're looking at $
512.00 - 33700 in buying power let me move this
515.48 - $75 wide spread closer to at the money
519.20 - so I can show you how this buying power
520.84 - changes now if you're doing this trade
523.20 - in a regular margin account you'll use
525.48 - about half you use around $2,000 in
528.24 - buying power maybe
530.00 - $1,800 uh in buying power if you're
532.32 - doing this in a margin account you're
534.00 - doing an IRA account $3,700 yes you can
537.52 - do this trade in an IRA account account
539.80 - okay let me move it closer to at the
542.08 - money where the where the product is
543.96 - trading you can see it's trading at
545.68 - $72.40 just for the EAS the math I'm
548.08 - going to go and buy the 70 I'm going to
550.04 - sell the
551.04 - 775 1 by two here and when you look at
554.60 - that uh it's a 14 Cent debit just to
556.68 - show you how much that product is going
558.04 - to move If It Moves In a very uh quick
560.32 - period of time here look at the buying
562.56 - power it's
564.60 - $110,000 so this will move the buying
568.52 - power will move move as the product gets
571.44 - closer to at the money and when the
574.84 - product um is is uh getting closer to
579.32 - expiration and it's closer to add the
581.44 - money so there's two ways this buying
583.28 - power can move in here I would expect
585.12 - that around this $10,000 would be about
587.04 - as high as it would go because we're
588.80 - looking at it right at the money uh
590.96 - spread so this this buying power can
593.88 - triple if you are using a regular margin
596.64 - account it' be around $5,100 it's half
599.36 - it' be around $5,100 so this is a very
602.28 - very big product with a lot of little
604.84 - nuances to it um and I hope that I
608.64 - helped you learn a little bit about
611.68 - Futures options and the margin or span
615.20 - margining uh that they use on on these
618.64 - products could be very helpful for using
620.28 - leverage uh for getting very big what
623.04 - would be uh for getting very big or very
624.88 - small contract so if you're if you're
626.60 - used to doing one contract spy
629.88 - spreads or ratio spreads 1 by two this
633.28 - would be 10 times the side it'd be like
634.88 - doing 10 by 20 this would not be in my
637.32 - opinion suitable for you to do even
639.52 - though the buying power is quite low or
642.36 - inside your buying power threshold
644.40 - because it can expand to double what you
647.12 - would be used to $5,000 over $10,000 and
649.48 - plus the numbers get very big so this is
651.24 - for the larger Traders I've been doing a
653.56 - couple of smaller trades with iron
655.24 - Condors this one's for the larger
657.04 - Traders I did mine for a 30 Cent credit
