0.08 - so you started trading when you were 11
2.04 - I did a lot of lawn cutting $10 to $15 a
5.64 - lawn or I could go out and sell a cover
7.72 - call and maybe make 80 or 100 that's
10.40 - impressive have about an 87% success
13.32 - rate over about 30 years you know we're
15.48 - not talking about a small amount of
16.64 - money I try to trade for base hits
19.24 - that's really how you build wealth he's
21.16 - been able to generate plus 25 or 30%
24.40 - return for most of the last 7 years
28.31 - [Music]
34.84 - all right welcome back everybody this is
37.12 - another rising star and today is going
40.60 - to be a fun one because I've known John
44.24 - for quite a while John welcome to Tasty
46.48 - and welcome to the rising star shoot
47.84 - thank you I I mean I met you once before
50.56 - we went out to to lunch a couple years
52.88 - ago in Atlanta when I a show down there
55.92 - at the varsity at the varsity right at
58.60 - the varsity yep what
60.44 - have what do you have what do you have
62.44 - yeah what do you have what do you say
63.60 - wasn't it like yeah crazy um anyway but
66.64 - the fun thing is you know we've stayed
68.32 - in touch over the years and um through
71.64 - lots of emails and I'm an email junkie
74.84 - you're you're a pretty good email junky
76.48 - yourself and um we have um you know
81.28 - followed each other's trades and and
83.16 - talked about trading for years now so I
86.12 - have a pretty good idea of who you are
88.04 - but we're going to introduce you to all
89.36 - that to a tasty nation and your story is
92.16 - a really fun story I have to start off
93.68 - this thing by saying um I wanted to
96.32 - title this um the crocodile
99.76 - hunter because you're the only person I
102.52 - I've ever met that's actually um hunted
106.28 - a crocodile I don't know I don't know if
108.48 - that's good or bad but I live in the
110.20 - city here and we don't have a lot of
111.28 - crocodiles in downtown Chicago we have
113.52 - other problems but we don't have
115.44 - crocodiles what something I've always
117.28 - wanted to do um it's kind of out there a
120.44 - risk um project and something I thought
124.12 - would be fun same with the pythons yeah
126.40 - you're a python Hunter too that to me
128.76 - seems just insane so I can't even like I
132.12 - can't
133.76 - rationalize hunting for
136.12 - pythons so I'm not even going to go
138.56 - there yeah cuz I can't figure that out
140.96 - at all in um the non-financial stuff I
143.60 - like a little more risk so the hunting
145.32 - of the and pythons when it comes to
147.68 - you'll see when we talk with the um
150.00 - quite risk adverse when it comes to
151.72 - investing bill I find that to be very
153.84 - strange that you're willing to go out
155.60 - and hunt a python with your bare hands
158.08 - or a crocodile with your bare hands but
160.20 - you're uncomfortable selling a naked
162.72 - call or puss oh no I'll do that but
164.80 - there you know have to mitigate the risk
166.48 - okay talk about okay anyway I I find
169.52 - that kind of fun anyway but the other
171.76 - side to this is that the angle that I
174.80 - want to take with you and and I hope
176.24 - you're okay with this is
181.44 - you you're 55 you're 12 years younger
184.44 - than me and we've been trading about the
186.96 - same amount of time 44 years for both of
190.16 - us you started when you were 11 which I
192.68 - find pretty incredible I didn't start
194.64 - till I was in about you know um early
198.20 - 20s I didn't even know about trading
200.32 - before that um but we've both been doing
202.72 - this a long time and I think that the
205.52 - the real story here is
208.76 - longevity and I've always been one that
210.96 - goes around talking at different
212.56 - seminars and entrepreneurial events and
215.08 - and different business stuff and and I
217.32 - like to preach that there is a very
222.04 - tiny um difference between success and
226.04 - failure and the most important aspect of
229.36 - success is longevity mhm I agree 100%
234.12 - and you're my proof you're my walking
235.64 - talking you know proof of this yeah so
237.96 - you'll see if you go on YouTube and
240.36 - you'll see a lot of trade for 30 minutes
242.92 - a day and drive this
244.76 - Lamborghini yes that doesn't that's not
247.28 - me it's not how things work well it's
249.24 - not anybody that's not the real world I
250.92 - mean there's there's six outwire cases
252.88 - you know like you know guy you know Mark
255.40 - Zuckerberg starts company when 22 turns
257.64 - into to be worth you know a trillion
259.72 - dollars there's not a lot of cases like
261.68 - that I try to trade for base hits or
264.84 - doubles I'll take the home run if it
266.92 - comes but I don't trade for it um I'm
269.92 - I'm a trade small trade often like
272.44 - Trader 100% um yeah I've been trading
276.08 - for like when I was 11 Mike grandfathers
278.92 - was an options Trader he traded a lot of
281.00 - options way back before there was online
285.76 - anything yeah I'm sure so I remember
287.72 - being at his house we' go through the
289.12 - newspaper and I I probably haven't
290.56 - touched the newspaper like in 30 years I
293.32 - you but we' go through the newspaper
295.80 - look at the stocks look at Option prices
298.80 - um we used to have these big books like
300.76 - I think it was SNP or someone that would
303.60 - Lea through these value line value line
306.00 - that got be and they would be like three
307.80 - months old but you could see charts and
310.12 - and a little bit of um ratios in there
313.04 - so uh of course at 11 I wasn't trading
315.72 - strangles no of course it was um mainly
319.24 - buying calls and selling cover calls oh
322.96 - okay so I did a lot of at that age say
325.56 - like early teens I did a lot of lawn
328.36 - cutting so $10 $15 a lawn or I could go
332.96 - out and sell a covered call and maybe
334.60 - make 80 or 100 and it was a lot less
336.96 - work um now I I did both so I would do
340.12 - the cover calls and cut grass because
341.88 - there's a there's something fun about
344.12 - cutting grass uh then I always had a
346.76 - penchant for investing so I became a
349.60 - series 7 broker at 18 at 18 you can
352.68 - become Series 7 you can't who would
354.88 - register an
356.20 - 18-year-old oh that's crazy and so
359.20 - before you went to college you got a
360.60 - series 7 or at the same time at the same
364.00 - time yeah about the same time that's
366.76 - that's kind of crazy so you
368.84 - undergraduate degree and graduate degree
371.16 - both in finance accounting that's right
374.16 - um taxes yeah I got so so your your
377.76 - professional career was
379.76 - in let's call it Financial Accounting I
383.04 - mean Financial Accounting um a lot of
386.40 - business Consulting business process
388.96 - improved all that type of stuff and that
391.40 - brought me uh up and down the east coast
394.20 - and then um for the last couple decades
397.20 - overseas and we've been okay so so you
401.28 - grew up in Florida and you end up all
404.20 - around the world doing financial
407.72 - consulting tax Consulting and everything
409.80 - else but you're trading
413.28 - primarily that whole time in US markets
416.16 - y or or no always us always us markets
420.04 - but you taught yourself lots of
421.28 - different
422.52 - languages um a few a few I'm not good at
426.32 - any of them I barely know English you
428.20 - were learning about business all over
429.68 - the world so so you have a um a probably
434.04 - a different perspective on on what US
437.12 - market structure is and you know how
439.84 - businesses run in a kind of in a free
442.52 - market as opposed to businesses running
444.76 - in maybe let's call them non-free
447.04 - markets non-free markets right and then
449.52 - probably give you a pretty good
450.68 - appreciation for what we have here it it
454.36 - really does cuz from the US of course
456.84 - it's the SEC and those it's kind of a
459.04 - double-edged sword you don't want all
460.84 - the um regulations but you also want
464.52 - them it it gives you the disclosures it
467.12 - protects the individual you want the
468.68 - Integrity you you want Marketplace
470.88 - Integrity you would prefer to have less
475.28 - regulatory limitations and fences yeah
478.16 - and there's a line depending on what
480.60 - side of the fence you're on yeah and
482.84 - we've been we've been challenged with
484.84 - this and AR you know and debating this
487.24 - forever we're still we had the debate
489.00 - this morning actually on air same type
491.00 - of thing um you know as we get towards
493.60 - tokenization and things like that so
496.16 - throughout your entire professional
497.84 - career you're trading but you're not
499.96 - necessarily trading you know complex
502.64 - option strategies you're just you're
504.12 - trading you're just trading stocks
506.24 - you're trading Futures you're tra you
507.52 - trade everything right yep product
509.60 - different but at some point you you
512.76 - how'd you find tasty about 5 years ago 6
517.28 - years ago I was looking for ways to
520.16 - improve my trading I did really well um
523.80 - have about an 87% success rate over
527.08 - about 30 years but just understand that
529.92 - 87% success rate does not mean 87%
533.68 - return I I going yes like I have a very
536.32 - high success rate but a lot of times it
538.20 - doesn't mean cuz I'm a high I like to do
541.28 - high probability trades where you're
542.68 - going to be successful most of the time
544.28 - right but it doesn't mean it doesn't it
546.72 - doesn't translate to it necessarily to a
548.88 - return just c yeah 100% I as a goal I
552.44 - try to have around 3% so 40 to 50% a
555.76 - year but that's you know an object it's
558.44 - a goal um and the
560.60 - 87% it might be a little bit too risk
563.96 - adverse you know maybe but it works but
567.12 - like when I do Futures it's like 50 5%
570.08 - so I'm not very not as good as with
572.32 - commodities as I am with with stock
574.32 - options yeah but I've traded as you know
577.04 - I've traded in a bunch of oceans in the
579.00 - middle of the ocean oh yeah I've traded
581.12 - on all the continents except for um
583.56 - Antarctica but I'll be there later this
585.80 - year and I plan to put a token trade on
588.48 - there hopefully I get some so some
590.12 - people like to do marathons in all seven
592.80 - continents and I don't see you as a
595.24 - marathon runner so I'm going to guess
596.68 - that you want to be trading in all seven
598.52 - cost of yes yeah that's kind of cool
600.80 - though I probably have traded in a 100
602.44 - different countries as well that's
604.40 - impressive that you even been to 100
606.32 - different countries do you have anybody
608.32 - in your world that does what you do do
612.12 - you have anybody to talk to I have uh a
615.36 - couple people that I know that a couple
617.64 - people yeah y but it's a small Universe
620.00 - it's a very small universe and it's
622.36 - always been like that okay uh because if
624.96 - you go to a party or something oh what
626.24 - do you do oh I trade stock options and
628.76 - then you get the
631.00 - fuzzy glassy look yeah and so um what
636.12 - about your wife she think you're crazy
638.20 - yeah you know how it is being married to
639.68 - a traitor
641.48 - so for your wife well I don't know how
644.00 - it is being married to a traitor I know
645.80 - what she says about me but that's up
647.52 - yeah it's um you know you one of the
650.72 - toughest things is to not be
654.12 - emotional you and you're making a trade
656.28 - or a trade goes everybody can put a
658.00 - trade on it's how do you make manage it
659.80 - when it goes you don't seem to
661.88 - be you seem to be emotionally pretty uh
665.68 - pretty even yes but if something really
668.40 - goes against you and you've taken a
670.04 - position that's too big what about when
673.44 - things get like how did you do on you
676.48 - know uh August 5th this year or you know
680.04 - the week week ago Monday whatever it was
682.76 - we opened down was that this Monday
684.92 - can't remember might be this Monday we
686.28 - open
687.12 - down you know 40 points in the SVS right
691.16 - right well there's a little bit of that
694.36 - anxiety well on the on the Futures on
696.88 - Sunday night where you go oh boy Monday
699.56 - might be really difficult and um so
702.76 - you're junkie do you have to watch the
704.96 - market try not to I try to keep business
708.00 - hours let's say for the markets um and
712.16 - not have it spill into the rest of life
714.92 - um it doesn't always work but I that's
717.60 - what I'm attempting business hours are
719.44 - by the way from Sunday night at 4 5:00
723.00 - till Friday at 5:00 those are bil this
725.56 - hours I mean I make no mistake you know
728.60 - it's it's there's a few trading hours
731.36 - that you really are trading but mentally
734.08 - it's 20 hours a day right it's just how
737.20 - it is um and it's I think anybody can
741.52 - trade anybody can learn how to trade if
743.96 - I could do it I think any I'm not real
745.52 - smart I mean sure I'm just an average
747.40 - guy um people can TR it um but can you
751.08 - do it over the long term and you don't
753.04 - blow up your account um that's the the
755.84 - whole longevity thing that's the 44
758.04 - years of this um how many hours a day
761.36 - are you in front of your
762.72 - screen six six hours a day in front of
766.12 - your screen yeah5 yeah okay that that's
769.28 - legit like that's like that's like Tom
771.92 - hours like those are like I enjoy it
774.80 - what else would I do those are dog hours
776.88 - those those are like you know that's
778.44 - junky stuff
779.64 - yeah um what concerns me is okay I've
781.52 - been doing this for 40 years um well how
785.68 - many more years do I have can I do it
787.36 - for another 20 probably not another 40
790.52 - so it's a it's a strange and I don't
793.44 - know if you thought about that yourself
794.76 - but what do you do and I don't think
796.52 - about it because I don't want to know
798.08 - like I don't want to I mean
801.44 - um I am I'm I'm always reminded of the
804.56 - story of when years ago when we first
807.88 - built think or so there there was a
810.28 - there was a one of the original guys
813.24 - that started the CME uh one of the first
816.20 - I think five members of the CMA um he's
819.12 - about mid90s and he was the uncle of a
821.92 - buddy of mine and he was still trading
824.68 - in his mid90s and we had a walk up our
827.92 - our ability was a walk up and he came to
830.00 - the office and he he's couldn't make it
832.60 - up the stairs so one of the guys on the
833.88 - trade desk carried him upstairs cuz we
836.08 - didn't have an elevator at the time and
839.12 - you still trading in ' 95 and he was my
842.08 - inspiration because I'm like you know
843.96 - and he's sitting there sitting on our
845.40 - trade desk you know with his with his
847.88 - own account open going yeah you know
850.80 - sell this you know he was still trading
852.84 - basically every future on the CMB and
855.80 - I'm watching this guy and I'm like okay
857.76 - that's what I'm doing like he can do
860.00 - this at 95 you's got an oxygen tank
861.76 - there I'm like I could do this like I
864.28 - don't I see myself in the exact same you
866.64 - know doing the exact same thing he was
868.52 - he was and he was you know yelling at
870.60 - the screen and I'm
872.80 - like that will keep me alive buunny well
875.56 - I'm teaching my mom how to trade so
878.56 - she's 80 she does uncovered puts and
884.28 - sells CER calls there you go by the way
887.12 - I'm a genius she says she is she well
890.12 - she has no choice at this point you know
892.32 - she's not have any more kids she's happy
894.12 - yeah she was making money she's making
896.24 - money full markets make make Geniuses
898.88 - out of their son of and so but you were
901.52 - always a genius now you're more of a
903.00 - genius yeah everybody makes money in bu
904.96 - Market yeah does it lead to anything
908.00 - else that you do like I mean I'm just
910.28 - saying you know are there other uh
913.36 - Hobbies occupation anything else does it
915.44 - help with you know the Consulting work
917.20 - and other things that you do well but
919.32 - one thing that it does help a lot with
921.16 - is uh trading in general makes allows
924.40 - you to look at
927.32 - data information quickly and make a
930.20 - quick decision and then you stand behind
932.48 - your decisions um you know CPAs by
935.52 - definition are not really Risk Takers
937.52 - right they they're much it's it's
941.00 - it's the analytical part yes the
943.80 - risk-taking part is sometimes you right
946.32 - exactly yeah yeah atypical and that the
949.56 - probabilistic side I think is easy to
951.92 - understand I think the speculative side
954.08 - is a little more challenging what is and
956.88 - you might find this too after I'm
958.40 - Trading have all my screens and
960.16 - everything's flashing and boom you're
962.20 - done for the day then you go out in the
964.52 - real world you have to turn off that um
968.60 - emotionless trading everything fits in a
971.68 - curve and now you're in this environment
974.52 - where it's like emotional and you got to
977.76 - not be analytical you got to be more you
979.60 - have to try to be normal you call it
981.08 - being normal right normal you have to
982.76 - talk to real people and try to be normal
984.96 - I remember trading uh the day of the
989.44 - crash in
990.48 - 1987 and it was one of the wildest days
994.08 - of my life so I remember like it was
996.36 - yesterday and and I left the training
1000.28 - floor a little after 3:00 central time
1002.52 - when we shut down and I went upstairs
1005.00 - the office and it was like it was almost
1006.96 - like a ghost town everybody had left and
1008.68 - it was just kind of scary and then I
1011.20 - drove home and stopped at a hot dog
1013.72 - stand and everybody was normal and I was
1016.84 - like what the f is going on on here like
1019.84 - does anybody know the stock mar crash
1021.40 - said and nobody cared well I Ed honestly
1025.04 - funny you say that cuz I use that as a
1026.48 - litus test is we see it and we feel it
1030.44 - and and if the if you go out in the
1033.76 - normal world and nobody's thinking of it
1035.72 - or no one even mentions it any day even
1038.00 - like Monday where it was real crazy like
1040.20 - no I guess it's not that big of a deal
1043.20 - um now if he gets to two days three days
1045.32 - four days like that then people and the
1048.16 - news media pick it up and everybody
1049.92 - talks about it then it might be a bigger
1051.36 - deal so I use that as my little bit of a
1054.16 - reality check of don't don't get too
1057.88 - worried about or too excited about
1060.12 - things do you ever think because of all
1062.16 - the traveling you've done in your life
1063.60 - and you know trading from a 100
1065.16 - different countries and all that kind of
1066.36 - stuff do you ever think that like you
1069.60 - have a different perspective like you
1071.00 - think about things differently like
1072.40 - currencies and precious metals and
1074.76 - things like that or does it all just
1076.20 - kind of has it all just become a numb
1078.20 - game now
1079.88 - um culturally I I hope I understand and
1084.32 - appreciate different cultures foods and
1087.04 - people insuring ideas but when it comes
1089.96 - to financial instruments I think it's
1092.68 - pretty pretty just it's right there it's
1095.20 - pretty much numbers yeah yeah it's just
1096.92 - numbers I got it what's the worst trade
1100.40 - that's gone against you recently
1103.20 - probably Tesla Tesla yeah and you were
1105.96 - shorted yes I was short I was short on
1108.40 - Tesla yeah but it's also my best trades
1110.72 - is Tesla I I treat I mean I'm I'm all
1114.24 - over the board Tesla's my biggest trade
1116.92 - trading vehicle because it's well
1118.96 - there's a lot of juice on there right
1120.44 - now yes and Tesla is um either the most
1124.76 - liquid or the second most liquid
1126.16 - underlying to trade Nvidia is number one
1128.84 - Tesla's number two so the reality is
1131.40 - that sure makes sense so like for
1134.52 - instance with Tesla right now I have
1137.20 - strangles I have a
1139.28 - I um call
1140.92 - butterfly I have naked puts and not it's
1145.12 - not Capital efficient I know but I will
1147.60 - buy the stock and sell at the money
1149.96 - cover calls just for the week there's so
1152.44 - much premium in that and then the stock
1155.28 - generally get
1156.76 - taken from me to and it gives me about a
1159.36 - 3% return a week I mean if that works
1162.84 - it's amazing it's not you know I know
1164.72 - it's not efficient yeah I know but it's
1166.52 - like if there's a little extra money
1167.88 - I'll do that okay yeah that's I mean for
1171.16 - people that are are inherently bullish
1172.88 - in Tesla that's a reasonable way to play
1174.84 - it so what happens when a
1179.36 - position doesn't
1181.40 - work so you do a covered call in Tesla
1184.48 - now the stock goes lower now what do you
1186.40 - do for inst Tesla went lower this week
1189.32 - yeah I had cover calls I rolled the
1192.68 - cover calls down yeah you know get more
1195.04 - Jews higher Delta um I'll keep that
1198.88 - premium this week more than likely now
1201.36 - have the stock yeah cuz it won't won't
1203.40 - be taken from me at my breke probably
1206.40 - not Tes but it jumps all over but if it
1209.00 - doesn't I'll just keep the stock and
1210.48 - Monday morning I'll put on new covered
1212.36 - calls just roll new covered calls yeah
1214.56 - yeah okay is there any part of the
1218.00 - trading world that kind of where you at
1221.16 - this point you you feel like I still
1223.72 - don't get this I really understand this
1226.48 - doesn't make any sense to me or does it
1228.80 - kind of Mak sense I mean you own
1230.32 - everything you do now from a
1232.68 - accountability standpoint oh I own
1234.72 - everything I I do um make very quick
1239.24 - decisions and you have to live with the
1241.04 - decisions you make oh for sure yeah 100%
1243.56 - it's all on me so what do you do when
1245.08 - something goes against you look at the
1247.40 - delta look at the profit loss roll down
1250.04 - roll out yeah and do size how often do
1253.80 - you you reduce size well this might be a
1256.60 - little bit of an odity um for me try me
1261.20 - uh my I don't
1263.68 - trade um definitely from a definitional
1267.76 - standpoint of large enough my net lick
1271.24 - is here and I'm trading here and so what
1274.20 - percent of your net L to use most of the
1275.80 - time um it's too low it's too low so
1278.80 - you're saying you're like under 35% yeah
1281.64 - okay so that's okay a year two years ago
1284.56 - I doubled my contract size my my NOA
1288.04 - trch
1289.24 - and then this year I went up another
1291.32 - 50% because I need to trade bigger kind
1294.64 - and I know most people are that's a high
1296.00 - class Problem by the way most have the
1297.88 - other way they're trading way too big
1300.96 - and um I mean in the whole world most
1303.64 - people have a get-rich quick mentality
1306.92 - which forces them to trade to do
1309.04 - everything too big and it usually
1310.76 - doesn't work out you're way better off
1312.84 - doing everything too small proving
1315.08 - concept and then scaling out like we do
1317.44 - it we even with the DTE I'm very happy
1320.20 - taking 50 $50 per um spread sure or you
1324.88 - know 25% whatever I I'm pickled yeah no
1328.44 - no I completely understand that to lot
1330.40 - me too and I'll do that all day long
1332.40 - just the same way I don't I don't feel
1334.00 - any you know I don't care what the
1336.08 - number is just as long as it's a
1337.28 - positive number I care it's $50 or $500
1339.44 - whatever it is it's just positive number
1342.28 - so
1344.04 - let's let's get
1346.36 - into okay how does somebody
1349.92 - trade for 40 plus years and just to put
1354.08 - context around John's account stuff I'm
1357.84 - just going to say that it's plus six
1361.24 - figures to make it clear to everybody
1363.16 - that you know we're not talking about a
1364.24 - small amount of money and um also that
1367.76 - you know targeted return for him he's
1369.92 - been able to generate in the you know
1373.64 - let's call it plus 25 or 30% return for
1377.48 - most of the last seven years and that's
1380.96 - impressive because that's really how you
1383.44 - build wealth and I'm going to be a
1385.64 - little vague on that because I really
1386.92 - want to get into the nitty-gritty of
1388.36 - kind of what do you do so like and and
1391.68 - and I should say that based on our our
1395.00 - pre our chat before we did this you make
1398.60 - about between 10 and 30 trades a day mhm
1401.44 - okay yeah you hit on a real slow day 50
1405.24 - if there's really problems that I have
1407.36 - to address yeah that that makes sense or
1409.68 - or the Market's really busy or there's
1410.96 - lots of opportunity and again how much
1413.16 - of that is in the Futures world and how
1415.12 - much that is sh in the equity World
1417.68 - probably
1418.96 - 80% Equity 80% Equity well that's not
1422.80 - that's very typical for a tasty Traer
1424.72 - just so you know like we're 8020 about
1426.96 - or 7722 something like that I mean I do
1430.00 - a lot of um on the future side I do a
1433.64 - lot of bonds currency some corn and
1437.32 - wheat uh I'm not very good at those but
1439.80 - I do put those on by the way nobody's
1441.60 - very good at those yeah and uh on that
1444.16 - market I they're such big products uh on
1446.96 - the future side I I trade generally um
1450.36 - spreads sure whether it's a future or
1453.12 - it's an equity the strategies to you the
1456.12 - mechanics I mean do you use different
1458.04 - mechanics or the same mechanics really
1459.96 - the same yeah that was something that um
1462.92 - 15 years ago or so I started getting
1465.16 - into the um Futures market and the as
1468.60 - you know different they trade at
1470.16 - different times different ticks all this
1472.16 - weird Nuance no and that's why I liked
1474.92 - your small exchange I hope that comes
1477.12 - back um it's we're we're working on it
1479.84 - right now um but then watching you all I
1483.76 - decided I don't really even need to know
1486.36 - all that detail um I'm just going to
1489.40 - trade it product and different and trade
1491.40 - with the same methodologies that I do on
1493.56 - the option side or the uh Equity side
1495.88 - what about shorter term options the zero
1498.80 - days and things like that the 1 DT zero
1501.88 - DT how much of your trading is zero and
1504.48 - 1 DT well it's growing um you know right
1509.16 - now we have a pretty good um
1512.80 - vix right 18 or oh so yeah little less
1517.72 - right to in 18 yeah so if that market
1521.48 - dries up the trading has to change you
1524.44 - know the style has to change and that's
1526.52 - always the trick is for me anyway to
1529.08 - know lot of volatility sell premium less
1533.44 - volatility when does it start moving um
1536.56 - when does it switch into more debit
1538.56 - spreads and things like that is there a
1541.20 - specific go-to strategy or is there
1542.72 - something like you you know like I know
1544.52 - you trade a lot of earnings I know you
1546.20 - trade some zero DTS um but is there a
1549.80 - specific kind of go-to
1552.56 - strategy um well on the zero day and
1555.60 - it's I'm trading those more often and
1558.72 - I'm you have great studies on those yeah
1561.32 - and so I've been trading them as the
1563.64 - market goes up I'm also now trading them
1566.64 - as the market trends down and also if
1568.80 - it's um flat and what I do with I take
1572.28 - all the methodologies that you have best
1574.32 - times of the day and and those things
1576.20 - it's based on volatility um but I also
1579.20 - overlay a 513 EMA 513 EMA so what does
1583.88 - that mean exp menal moving average um
1586.68 - and that is kind of the 513 um 5 day 13
1591.00 - day oh okay got it and so that that is
1593.36 - like theity with with that you don't do
1596.16 - any of the charting and I um being a CPA
1599.48 - I don't look at any of the numbers
1600.80 - anymore okay um the the numbers are
1604.80 - somewhat meaningless earnings and things
1606.60 - like that to me um it's all about what
1609.60 - the perception of the market the
1610.88 - Market's perception of what's the
1613.32 - strategy are you primar I mean you're
1615.56 - primarily a premium seller yes yeah yeah
1618.04 - okay and are you is it are you always
1621.76 - covered or is there a naked side to it
1624.80 - oh I probably do 70% naked 70% naked but
1628.48 - sometimes when you trade the zero days
1629.56 - you have to cover it just for Capital
1631.48 - reason that's right yeah there's some um
1634.20 - unique let's say SEC rules around that
1637.28 - yeah that you know yeah that'd be the
1639.16 - $120,000 on one lot yes exactly exactly
1642.64 - yeah um so on the I do a lot in the SPX
1648.28 - so you might have a study where it says
1650.48 - oh it's the best time to buy at 10:00
1652.52 - and you do a little debit spread at the
1654.32 - money uh I'll do that but I'll overlay
1657.72 - when the 513 crosses then if it's
1661.48 - Crossing at that same time I know that's
1663.20 - going to uh well I hope it's going to
1665.08 - give a little juice you never know you
1667.16 - never know but I'm trying to um even if
1670.48 - it's a one or 2% more chance of it I try
1673.20 - to what's your kind of core Equity
1674.96 - strategy like if you had like this
1676.88 - afternoon you know Apple has earnings
1679.16 - coming out like what's your Apple kind
1680.92 - of goto strategy well what I if you were
1683.08 - to trade it what I do every single day
1685.96 - um 100 200 300 times a day is look at
1690.84 - the stocks ivr that's the very first
1693.96 - thing I look at then look at
1698.00 - the volume for the stock okay I look at
1701.44 - the volume for the strikes okay um then
1706.36 - I look at the bid ask I'm looking for
1708.80 - tighter bit ask I look at Delta pop
1712.64 - gamma yeah um Theta not too much because
1716.52 - that's kind of already built no problem
1718.16 - so I I look at those things and then
1721.80 - um look at then I kind of look at the
1724.44 - charts a little bit to see you I bullish
1726.24 - bearish a lot of times I'm just delta
1728.04 - neutral okay and that's fine so like
1730.20 - with apple there's not much to juice in
1732.52 - it today but I probably would go delta
1735.12 - neutral 15 if there was enough premium
1737.56 - in it I go two times the expected move
1739.64 - one and a half times expected move is
1741.36 - like $9 the not much interest in that
1744.32 - yeah it could blow through that real
1745.48 - fast right so two times you expect the
1747.12 - move is $18 the premium out $18 was
1750.68 - about 75 total not really it's not that
1754.48 - interesting do you play it uh I rank is
1757.72 - in let's say 70s or 80s do you play it
1760.24 - um probably not okay probably not uh I'd
1763.52 - like to I like to get a little more okay
1767.08 - uh meta I had a$ five
1769.52 - doll um spread on and those were like
1772.52 - nine eight or nine Delta on each side
1775.16 - real far out and um and a lot of juice
1778.88 - yeah um yeah that was a different story
1782.32 - you can trade IBM and get upside down
1785.20 - right two times expect a move on that
1787.08 - today that's right when you start out
1789.68 - the day and you just look at your you
1791.84 - look at the screen you log on you look
1793.36 - at the screen to say okay like is your
1796.72 - thought process
1798.56 - and and I and I and I want you to get
1800.08 - really specific here detail-wise is the
1803.04 - first thing you do adjust existing
1805.76 - positions or is the first thing you do
1808.20 - go in and create new positions always
1810.64 - look at the existing okay when you look
1813.00 - at your existing positions are you
1814.96 - looking at your Delta or are you looking
1816.28 - at your p&l a little bit of both okay
1819.24 - cuz I'm a pnl person yeah cuz I look at
1822.04 - my p&l first to see what's messed up and
1825.00 - then I look at the Delta on those pnls
1826.64 - to see how I have to neutralized go
1828.40 - together of course I do and I don't roll
1830.32 - as much as you do um but I will roll I
1832.88 - roll up and down and uh probably 70%
1835.88 - like I said are um strangles um if the
1840.44 - ivr is low I might do a calendar a debit
1843.48 - calendar you know so really ivr really
1845.44 - drives and that's something that I
1847.36 - didn't have before tasty ivr just didn't
1851.12 - have you been able to keep your size and
1852.64 - check like what happens if you put a
1854.08 - position on it starts to go against you
1856.16 - is your is your first objetive to um to
1860.52 - adjust the position or reduce size or
1863.40 - add to it what do you do yes what do you
1866.32 - mean yes all all the above um I try not
1869.20 - to not to increase my size the first
1871.44 - thing is yeah you know it's always in my
1874.44 - mind the reversion to the meme so if we
1876.44 - get a big pop up or or a big pop down
1879.72 - like we did on with Nvidia or
1882.00 - some okay I feel like yeah that's a
1884.16 - little overdone so I might lay into it a
1886.92 - little bit more and sell more puts um or
1891.20 - sometimes I'll just say well I'm just
1892.60 - going to hold my position and it it'll
1895.52 - float I think the longevity with the
1899.44 - returns it's really remarkable so thanks
