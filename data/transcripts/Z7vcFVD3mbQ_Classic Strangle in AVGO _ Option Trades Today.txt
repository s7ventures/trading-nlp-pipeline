0.68 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.84 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
4.32 - you today January 2nd the first trade of
9.12 - 2025 uh but first as I always do let's
11.96 - take a quick look at the market &ps down
15.48 - $450 now that's a very small move but
18.56 - let's take a look at what's going on
19.72 - here today you have an $80 handle top to
22.52 - bottom on the &ps when I woke up this
25.36 - morning when I went to bed they opened
27.96 - up 13 but time I went to bed they were
30.88 - down 20 handles when I woke up they were
33.56 - up 50 handles they've been all over the
35.92 - place but yet volatility basically
39.12 - unchanged up 18 cents hasn't made a new
42.68 - high since last night 1765 is where we
46.56 - are right now little bit of churn here
48.64 - going on the market uh with now three
51.12 - indices lower that's the NASDAQ the Dow
54.88 - and the &ps and only the Russell are the
57.92 - highest I don't like when the is the
60.40 - highest for the breath of the market
62.16 - myself so I'm going to try to pick a
64.64 - neutral strategy for today let's see
67.16 - what I'm going to do you know I like to
69.52 - avoid earnings so I like to click on
71.72 - this little uh earnings here and get rid
73.80 - of all of these earnings so I can have
75.68 - all the stocks that don't have earnings
78.24 - here uh one of them that came to my
80.20 - attention avgo I'll put it up here for
83.52 - you see where it is as we go a little
86.36 - bit lower there it is
88.64 - avgo uh up
90.76 - $380 if it's up around $3.80 when you
93.68 - make this trade today you probably get
95.00 - filled at a better price than me but $2
98.28 - $235 stock um stocks at a good range
101.68 - today it's up near the higher end of its
104.16 - range even though the well I guess
106.44 - mid-range for the day 235 239 uh being
109.68 - the high so mid-range for the day Ivy
111.88 - rank is lower by two and a half% I
114.60 - prefer this number to be green but it's
117.20 - got a good Ivy rank of 40 one of the
119.20 - highest on the board and it has good
121.68 - option markets let's take a look at
123.44 - these markets they're two 3 cents wide
126.28 - two 3 cents wide pretty good 10 cents
129.32 - wide on some of the larger calls good
132.72 - size markets in avgo here good bid ass
137.44 - differential so what are we going to do
138.88 - in avgo well avgo had that big gap up
141.92 - about a month or so ago it's been going
144.60 - sideways I'm going to play it sideways
147.36 - here today also let's take a look at
149.40 - what I'm going to do I'm going to go to
150.68 - a classic one standard deviation
154.36 - strangle what do I mean by that I'm
156.32 - going to go to around the 15 Delta on
158.88 - each side I'm going to the 200 call on
163.88 - the I'm sorry the 200 put on the put
166.40 - side and I'm going to go up to the
168.76 - 280 uh call that's going to give me two
172.24 - uh short Deltas I got filled at
177.00 - $548 I got filled right at Mid price so
180.44 - maybe you can get filled um right at Mid
183.12 - price also here you can see right now
185.24 - the mid price is 550 which is even
187.16 - better remember the higher credit you
188.88 - receive the better off you are this is
190.92 - pretty much a delta neutral trade here I
193.48 - guess you can move this put up one if
195.48 - you want to be long a Delta and a half
198.12 - or if you move it lower I just went by
200.64 - pretty much on Delta meaning 15 Delta
202.96 - versus 13 Delta um and I also went on
205.64 - price $274 $274 and basically $2
210.40 - 74 so they equal priced options
213.68 - basically equal equal Delta options you
217.04 - are only
218.52 - $35 away on the put side and you are a
222.84 - lot more than that on the call side
225.60 - right so you know you're you're
227.96 - $45 away on the call side for those that
230.92 - are playing at home that's what you call
233.44 - call skew so if you wanted to go equal
236.12 - distance away you'd have to move this
238.08 - this this call in close to be at the
240.56 - same uh if you don't want to play the
243.72 - the skew I play the skew meaning if
246.00 - they're going to give me a higher price
247.40 - further out of the money option for the
249.12 - same credit that's where I go uh this
252.00 - this trade has about two short Deltas
254.40 - too it has a 77% pop a good interesting
257.24 - thing you can see here on the tasy trade
258.84 - platform which is a really nice uh
261.08 - illustration here's that one standard
263.36 - deviation line on top on bottom and this
266.48 - green line is your uh p&l um graph so
271.08 - you'll be able to make money in between
273.24 - or under
274.56 - 195 and in between 280 and 290 above 280
279.64 - uh 285 if you got filled at 50 cents
282.80 - 28550 would be your um break even to the
286.36 - upside your break even to the downside
289.04 - would be1 19450 if you got filled at
293.00 - $550 uh cents so a good outside the
297.24 - standard
298.28 - deviation um trade here this is a
302.20 - classic
303.76 - strangle High IV rank see the IV rank
307.04 - coming in here a little bit but High Ivy
308.72 - rank stock going sideways good markets
312.40 - on each side outside of standard
314.32 - deviation giving us that 77% pop we know
317.44 - we like to have a probably a profit
319.96 - above 65 all I want is time to go by and
323.28 - the stock to go up stock to go down and
326.12 - then allowing me to make a little bit of
328.52 - a profit I got feel at $548 maybe you
