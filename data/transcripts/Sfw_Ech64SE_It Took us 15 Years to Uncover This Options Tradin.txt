16.84 - beta button and it'll pull up this
19.12 - interface after you accept the terms and
21.20 - conditions yes signing away your life
23.92 - yes just kidding it's a cool feature
26.00 - where you can back test option
27.88 - strategies without putting up any risk
29.44 - it's basically a way to see how the
31.44 - strategy would have performed over a
33.52 - specific period of time in a specific
35.28 - ticker symbol you have entry and exit
37.72 - parameters you can customize as well so
39.52 - this is the first page you select your
41.20 - ticker symbol you can there's a they're
43.80 - built in so we don't have you don't have
45.76 - everything now hopefully at some point
48.56 - in the future I don't think it'll be
49.88 - everything but more selection they're
52.08 - adding more consistently but you can you
54.72 - have over 10 years of options data here
56.36 - you can customize and you can do it from
58.20 - this calendar yeah let's let's replicate
60.80 - the trade that I did for the written
62.52 - piece if you don't mind what do we do
64.72 - well I I don't I don't know you're go to
67.52 - we go to spy okay and then just keep the
69.64 - date the same January 1st 2023 January
72.36 - 1st 2023 yeah that's a default at least
74.68 - for this this one here oh why do I have
77.00 - to use your trade why can't I do mine I
79.64 - want to do my trade January 1 okay
82.44 - January 1 so you can select a strategy
84.52 - here you can go with a debit spread iron
87.44 - Condor whatever also build your own yeah
89.96 - just so you know but yes go on sorry I
92.12 - yeah you can custo you can customize it
94.24 - too I just made it kept it simple and I
96.08 - did a short put in spy so the way you
98.72 - can add other ones just so people know
100.68 - you can add legs like this up to four
103.08 - legs and you could change them Buy sell
105.24 - you could do any sort of custom funky
107.24 - thing you want to do you know selling a
109.04 - put spread to buy a call spread whatever
111.88 - whatever you want to do yeah yeah so
113.80 - yeah I did a short putut in spy I did
116.40 - adjust a couple things here so on this
118.24 - interface you can see your trade entry
120.92 - parameters and your exit parameters so I
123.12 - changed the Delta from 30 to 50 oh right
126.16 - at the money the money big risk taker um
129.08 - I also disabled the exact DTE okay so y
134.04 - because spy has weekly options like I
136.16 - don't really care about the exact day I
138.76 - I just want to get as close as possible
140.56 - and just keep this thing running yes I
142.44 - also limited the next one below it I
144.44 - limited the number of active trades so
146.88 - what that will do and I click the second
148.92 - one here oh close the old one and open a
150.96 - new one so with this and I change it to
152.92 - one one so this just ensures that the
155.68 - parameters will not go more than one
157.72 - contract at a time it's it's open close
159.88 - open close you won't you won't have open
162.04 - open open open and have like 10 trades
164.12 - on yes okay and then the only other
166.32 - thing I did here was I closed at 50%
169.28 - profit on the bottom right okay so you
171.84 - can change that to 50% there yeah yeah
174.24 - so 50 Delta put closest to 45 days have
177.56 - only one trade on on a time roll at
179.44 - expiration
180.36 - if it's still there uh and it has not
182.72 - reached the 50% profit but if it reaches
184.60 - the 50% profit it will close and open a
186.56 - new one and open a new one exactly and a
189.08 - couple things to note so you can of
190.92 - course change the quantity as well you
192.68 - can change the Delta and the expiration
195.80 - just keep in mind there you can't so for
198.68 - ease and simplification we're using
200.84 - Delta as opposed to strike because
203.08 - strikes are very different especially
204.56 - when you go back in time when things are
206.20 - lower priced you know if you're doing $5
208.68 - wide spreads in spy 10 years ago that's
212.52 - a way different position than a $5
214.44 - widespread now so when you use Delta it
216.92 - kind of accounts for some of that
219.20 - difference in in relative value it also
222.64 - makes it so that you know you don't miss
225.20 - specific strikes right so not every
228.48 - stock is going to have dollar wide
230.04 - strikes where you can pick exactly this
233.24 - strike so using Delta using the 50 Delta
236.08 - is basically just at the money
237.44 - regardless of whatever the stock price
239.44 - is exactly good and you run it and get
243.20 - your results easy yeah pretty quick yeah
246.04 - so what's cool about this feature is the
247.76 - orange line is your test so the orange
250.36 - line is your back test with all your
251.72 - parameters you can you can see at the
253.84 - top there all the all the things we
255.36 - entered as well short putut every 45
257.72 - days and all the conditions that apply
259.96 - and the Gray Line on this chart is if
261.64 - you were to just buy and hold spy so you
263.60 - can see but they're not the profits
265.36 - aren't together it's price of spy corre
268.52 - correct yeah so this is like spy is at
271.64 - 567 at the end and you've made 8 Grand
274.72 - yeah so they're the it's not just buying
277.20 - and holding it's just the price of the
279.32 - underlying mapped with the profit got it
282.28 - so as you can see short put in spy still
285.92 - does very well especially with these
287.24 - parameters still does very well even in
288.72 - a a ripping Market to the upside yeah
291.20 - your biggest draw down here was likely
293.44 - just now at in the August cycle when spy
296.44 - was was aggressively dipping um but you
298.84 - made it back on on the way back up yes
301.44 - so yeah nice feature here and then
303.76 - that's on the summary tab so the details
305.68 - tab is another way where you can see
308.36 - some more trade metrics and actually if
310.20 - you go back to the summary tab real
