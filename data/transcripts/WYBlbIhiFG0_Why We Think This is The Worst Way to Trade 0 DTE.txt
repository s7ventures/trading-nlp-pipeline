0.16 - zero dtes we try to give you a variety
3.76 - of zero DTE stuff every week um usually
7.00 - those guys are in the SPX pit so we kind
9.08 - of think it's fun to do it down there
10.60 - but um let's have a little fun with this
13.88 - defending zero DTS the what we decided
17.28 - to look at today was basically stop
19.40 - orders and um because we get a lot of
22.80 - questions and I got a lot of emails just
24.44 - overnight alone on stop orders
28.40 - so I mean we'll give it a shot well what
31.96 - let's do it the the simple bottom line
34.96 - is if you
37.52 - combine um stop orders with smart
40.76 - management you can get away a little bit
43.04 - with some stops if you just think stops
45.60 - are going to protect you with no
47.00 - management you're a dead
49.12 - man dead man walking so you the stop
52.84 - order it was was originally looked at at
56.40 - as um you don't have to look at it
58.88 - anymore like that you have a stop order
60.64 - so your work is done really and what
62.40 - you're saying is your work really isn't
63.76 - done with a stop
65.32 - order yeah right like like a stop order
68.68 - is not is is it's not preventive
71.08 - medicine in other words a stop order can
74.52 - complement some smart optimization of
78.04 - early trade management but a stop order
80.60 - on its own is not going to make you
83.00 - money all right in the zero days so
85.96 - using cheap far the money long options
88.80 - allows even smaller the opportunity to
90.60 - sell zero DT premium we have not done a
93.20 - lot of zero DT premium recently because
96.60 - um to be fair you know the markets
99.16 - volatility is low we just haven't done
100.96 - anything we're record highs y um yeah
104.32 - but when you buy long Wings they're more
105.76 - about buying power control than risk
107.24 - mitigation so stop losses which are
109.72 - standing orders to exit a trade at at a
112.00 - certain market price or you could do
114.44 - stop limit as well um if it if it turns
118.20 - too far against you are a common
120.68 - if unreliable tool in the management
122.96 - mechanics stop orders were big you know
126.24 - many many many moons ago um if you
130.04 - noticed on tasty I think ta I think Tony
133.36 - and I have talked about stop orders
135.36 - maybe one time a year for the last 14
137.84 - years and never once have we ever
140.16 - suggested to use one so it is not part
143.44 - of what we do period
146.00 - mhh managing losers is sure to decrease
148.92 - our percentage of winning trades but how
151.04 - does it affect our net profitability and
153.84 - what stop loss levels have performed
155.36 - best for zero DT trades these are the
157.72 - questions that a lot of people have
159.44 - let's take a next let's go to next
162.04 - slide so we did a study when we looked
166.52 - at 50 Delta straddles or 30 Delta
168.80 - strangles at each market open we
171.16 - explored the effect of the stop loss
172.92 - order ranging from 25 to 200% of the
176.16 - initial credit so that means if you sell
179.28 - something for a dollar you're stopping
181.64 - yourself out at $125 or
184.16 - $3 right that's what that means yep yep
187.72 - um for each stop loss level we
189.80 - considered with or um we considered with
193.48 - or with managing winners at 25% of the
196.48 - initial credit that's our that's really
198.56 - our Target and that's what our research
200.08 - shows is essentially
202.84 - optimal all trades were assumed to be
206.24 - executed at Mid price um now
210.32 - the wings cost extra money and stop
212.44 - orders are less than perfect as far as
215.28 - you know good fills let's put it that
217.36 - way let's go to next
220.84 - slide okay so the first one's the
223.24 - straddles now we don't sell a lot of
224.76 - straddles but um you're going to see
226.92 - first of all that that the win
228.56 - percentage um on straddles is is a
231.80 - little bit
235.88 - iffy um they're kind of low that's why
238.52 - we don't do a lot of straddles
240.52 - but if you put your stop loss in at 25%
242.68 - if you put your stop loss in at 50% or
245.48 - 100% or 200% you're still all at 50 or
248.24 - less but the scary part is your average
250.12 - p&l for all those numbers is negative so
252.84 - the bottom line basically locking in a
254.48 - basically locking in a loss when you're
256.20 - using a stop loss order doing exactly
258.12 - what it's supposed to do it's giving you
259.68 - a loss you're locking in a loss these
263.60 - are all locking and losses every stop
266.44 - order straddle at 25% 50% 100% or 200%
270.84 - locked in a loss over time let's go next
273.72 - slide this is two years worth of data
276.60 - now if you do the
278.24 - straddle but you do it side by side with
280.92 - the 25% profit Target your win
284.20 - percentage goes from 40 to 60 from 40 to
288.12 - 70 from 50 to 77 and from 50 to almost
291.44 - 80 all your pnls turn
294.88 - positive so the answer to this the
297.64 - answer to the first question is anybody
300.48 - that trades zero DTE if you're are going
303.00 - to use the stop order and and this is
306.32 - like this is essentially this isn't just
309.44 - some research this is
311.04 - groundbreaking research if you're going
313.72 - to do zero DTS and you think you're
316.08 - going to make money using stop orders at
318.56 - certain percentage you're you're you're
320.64 - off you're just you're not there's no
323.92 - statistical evidence that anything Works
326.68 - in that case if you want to make money
329.16 - Trading zero DTS and you want to use a
332.52 - stop loss at 25% 50% 100% or
336.72 - 200% over time you have to have a 25%
340.32 - profit Target and that's the only way it
342.84 - makes
346.20 - money okay so so so you're saying I have
349.28 - to put
350.08 - in you're not saying both orders
353.72 - right what where are you are you saying
357.04 - putting in both orders like putting in
358.88 - like a bracket order putting in a a
361.80 - stop you're you're you have a you you're
364.96 - buying it you're buying it back for it's
367.48 - not it's not a it's not a one cancels
369.16 - the other just you have to manage the
370.96 - trade so if you're going to put a 25%
372.64 - stop loss in you have to have a 25%
375.96 - profit Target
377.60 - first like like no matter what you
380.16 - basically have to have a 25% profit
381.88 - Target across the board yeah across the
383.72 - board no matter what you
385.12 - do
386.76 - okay that's your resting order
390.64 - let's go to next
392.92 - slide okay so 30 Delta
395.56 - strangles it's the exact same thing if
398.40 - you just use a stop loss order the your
402.04 - win percentage is like the same 33 41 50
404.92 - 57 and every single p&l is a
408.84 - loss go to the next slide Beth if you
412.56 - add the stop loss in there every single
415.44 - one is a win and your numbers go up from
418.76 - 30 something to 62 73 80 and
425.16 - 86 um it does seem to be an there does
427.84 - seem to be an
430.04 - optimal stop loss here on on on around
433.08 - that 50% doesn't it yeah yeah that seems
435.84 - like when it when it goes It goes well
437.92 - against you yeah yeah the optimal stop
440.12 - loss would probably be between 50 and
442.00 - 100% but the reality is you have to use
444.40 - the 25% profit Target in order to make
446.80 - money right right so don't get greedy
449.96 - just if you put an order in the zeros
452.16 - put your profit Target at 25% or 20%
455.08 - Then you can put your mental stop or
456.88 - your stop in above
459.08 - that let's go to next slide makes sense
462.32 - I got it yeah so the takeaways are
464.96 - employing stop loss orders to defend Zer
467.12 - TT premium trades without also managing
469.76 - the winners was a recipe for failure
473.20 - when coupled with rapidly taking winners
477.24 - things got more interesting as with
479.04 - profit targets the zero DT option
481.64 - positions seem to benefit from tighter
483.64 - stoploss orders that's what Tony said
485.96 - around 50 to 100% rather than 200 um and
491.04 - with closer to at the money trades
494.12 - especially performing well when they
495.60 - closed when closed rapidly win or loss
498.32 - so while exiting losers brought down the
500.92 - percentage of winners significantly was
504.12 - also effective at reducing downside
506.16 - exposure and left enough profits to more
508.72 - than cover the puring Wings Bear in mind
511.20 - that when using stoploss orders that
513.48 - once triggered they will fill out a
514.88 - market price which may be worse than
518.40 - where you set them you can set
520.48 - marketable limits you can set limit
522.32 - orders too
