0.16 - how wide should iron Condors be how wide
2.92 - Tony
3.76 - Batista about this wide not this wide
7.80 - got fit in between
9.40 - there um so how watch Iron Iron our iron
14.96 - Condors be and the answer we're going to
17.20 - find out let's do it iron Condors are
20.00 - one of the most popular strategies for
21.20 - new Traders and smaller count sizes
24.04 - however one question many people have is
25.72 - how wide should they be because the
27.56 - regular iron Condors you know the risk
28.96 - rewards are tough but we got to make
31.68 - something happen here so how do you make
34.28 - something happen with iron condos well
35.52 - in today's segment we're going to
36.36 - explore the optimal width for different
39.60 - underlyings and by adjusting the wiek
41.88 - span of iron Condors Traders can
44.56 - optimize their risk reward balance and
46.24 - improve profitability smaller Wings
48.72 - might not receive enough credit while
49.96 - larger Wings may be too expensive to
52.04 - trade with a lower return on Capital we
53.96 - looked at five underlyings of different
56.24 - prices $100 stock $200 stock 300 400 a
59.04 - $500 stock
60.52 - all with similar IVs okay so we do the
64.72 - q's Microsoft Visa which we don't look
67.88 - at very often
69.84 - iwm and xbi and again we did this
73.00 - because we wanted to cover each price
74.56 - range okay
76.72 - MH we calculated the average p&l the
80.52 - return on Capital used for different
82.12 - wings and then all the trades were done
84.16 - at 45 days to expiration and um 16 Delta
88.64 - short strikes manag at 21 DT over 1,000
92.72 - trials were recorded for 12 years of
96.60 - study 2013 to 2025 all right yep we're
102.20 - going we're going the whole Gauntlet
103.64 - with you how wide should it be so for a
106.04 - $500 underlying like the q's the $5 Wide
109.44 - Wings did not have a positive return on
112.44 - Capital while every other wi did it's
116.08 - pretty interesting because pry I would I
118.76 - would have thought it would even have to
119.56 - be wider than that on a $500 underline I
122.20 - would say you know the the 2030 $50 wide
126.24 - iron Condor would have been where you
127.48 - wouldd have to go this is really telling
131.24 - and you know why because there's no way
134.48 - I would have got any of these numbers
136.40 - right agreed I know I wouldn't I mean
139.36 - the $5 doll wide wi that's crazy to me
142.68 - which one of these is optimal I I don't
144.48 - know the answer I really don't but what
147.32 - I do know is no more $5 Wide Wings in
150.32 - the qes yeah that's true well that's
152.04 - right because when you talk about you
153.20 - know
154.00 - $500 uh stocks you're looking at the
156.48 - cu's $500 right I mean I know it's an
158.44 - ETF would
159.68 - you yeah yeah all right so for a $400
164.44 - wide a $400 underlying such as Microsoft
169.00 - the majority of the return on capitals
171.44 - were positive the best return on Capital
173.72 - was the $25 wings so again even in a
177.12 - $400 stock like Microsoft the $5 wide
179.88 - Wings we're not profitable and you look
182.00 - at this thing you're like well I you
184.16 - just can't go narrow in these iron
185.44 - condors and we've been saying this for a
187.36 - long time I don't know if we've come to
188.80 - the $ five conclusion like this but
191.00 - we've been saying this for a long time
192.32 - tight iron condors and that's the
194.36 - quandry in a smaller account you know
196.20 - you you have to have a tight iron Condor
198.36 - it kind of opens you up to um well A
202.28 - Hard Road to profitability so here's a
204.92 - $300 underline and again the $5 Wide
207.92 - Wings no bueno mhm 10 15 20 all worked
213.68 - $5 no but the $20 Wings which has been
217.64 - the case across the board this seemed to
220.08 - be the best um The Proven winner across
223.72 - the board yeah it even it even goes to
225.40 - the zero days from our research that 20
228.24 - even $30 wide iron Condor playing these
231.72 - zero day options uh that seems to be the
234.32 - best bang for your buck also from our
236.04 - research at least yeah let's go um let's
239.96 - go to the $200 and in the $200 stock the
242.68 - $5 Wide Wings which is iwm it didn't
244.96 - work either right and the the $15 wide
248.68 - wings were the best but basically 15 20
253.16 - um which this is a huge it's kind of an
256.36 - indictment on like everything that
259.16 - everybody talks about and teaches with
260.68 - iron Condors you kind of got to get wide
262.72 - otherwise you can't do them yep yep and
265.92 - you gotta get listen you gotta get a
267.16 - wide stance in football you gotta get a
268.84 - wider stance in baseball you need
270.48 - stability s off you got to go wider
273.36 - that's why you're two little pin legs
275.32 - you like to go naked because you don't
276.96 - have that wide stance you can't uh you
279.28 - can't grip the ground got him I'm so
281.80 - happy you explain that to me you're
285.24 - welcome um NASDAQ up 11 Big Boy let's go
289.56 - to the next
292.52 - slide in the $100 stock the $5 Wide
296.84 - Wings didn't work either so there's no
299.72 - $5 Wide Wings
302.32 - anymore yeah yeah this is5 that's it $5
307.20 - gone so those people who do our uh our
310.00 - uh rins and stuff like that don't be
312.16 - calling no $5 iron Condors I don't want
314.20 - to hear it
315.16 - anymore don't be calling in in this case
317.52 - the lower priced the $10 wide wing was
319.80 - the best but still yep yep so some of
324.04 - the takeaways here um and this is kind
327.44 - of super interesting so the results from
331.24 - the study show that in order to achieve
333.88 - a larger return on used capital and
336.68 - average p&l for higher price underlying
338.40 - you need to widen your strikes the
340.28 - amount by which the average penl goes up
342.80 - per $5 change in width decreases after
345.48 - the wing width sweet spot is hit for
348.20 - that underline however if the underly is
350.68 - low priced may be difficult to be
352.92 - consistent using the wider Wing Iron
354.88 - Condors due to the buying power and less
356.72 - return on Capital so for smaller
358.48 - accounts stick to the narrow wings like
360.04 - $10
361.48 - wide for a general guideline iron
364.76 - Condors iron Condor Wings should be
367.68 - between 10 and 30 increasing in $5
371.04 - increments for every $100 increase in
373.28 - price that's pretty good that is that is
376.24 - pretty good however you may adjust those
380.00 - for your own risk reward strategies as
381.84 - long as the potential return on Capital
383.32 - and pnl remain in check so basically
386.36 - what the research team did because we've
387.76 - never done this before is they've
389.96 - essentially said okay so for every $100
394.36 - in price raise so $100 stock go $10 wide
399.60 - $200 stock go 15 a $300 stock go 20 a
403.64 - $400 stock Go 25 and a $500 stock go 30
407.44 - yeah I got it makes sense and we we we
409.68 - we've discussed similar plays like that
413.00 - you know expanding more like um no we
414.92 - never made it that mechanical no we me
416.48 - $300 stocks $30 wide we didn't do it
418.72 - quite as well quite a good job $2 stock
420.88 - $20 wide $400 stock $40 wide kind of
423.36 - making stocks out of um Iron Condor is
425.96 - out of play for smaller stocks on the
427.60 - larger stocks I like the way they've
429.52 - done here by going up by $5 incr uh
432.16 - increments it works out nicely even the
433.92 - S&P is up 20 NASDAQ up 13 Russell up 24
438.00 - the Dow up 260 volatility in by 54 cents
442.68 - um side I got an email here that square
445.08 - is now
446.48 - XYZ uh already so we can't say hey you
449.76 - trade stock XYZ anymore because now
452.32 - there is a stock XYZ do you believe it
455.60 - kind of interesting that they did that
