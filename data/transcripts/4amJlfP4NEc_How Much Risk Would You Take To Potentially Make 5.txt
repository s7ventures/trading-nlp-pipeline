0.32 - So today we're going to talk about how
2.20 - buying power reduction BPR reflects
6.00 - option trading risk now the simplest way
8.48 - to to Define this option buying power
11.88 - basically is your risk right there's no
14.52 - other thank you this segment is now over
16.12 - sponsored by the CB we're all done you
18.16 - take your option buying power and that
20.44 - is the cleanest definition of risk that
22.68 - there is because what could be more
25.44 - accurate than what you're required to
27.56 - put up to make the trade yes exactly I
30.76 - side how much how much risk do you think
32.80 - we're willing to take to make 50 cents
35.76 - right basically you know whatever that's
38.72 - the that's the model that's the model so
41.24 - BPR buy Power reduction refers to the
44.16 - capital requirement that a trade must
46.08 - maintain when holding certain positions
47.88 - in their brokerage account naked option
49.88 - strategies may require higher capital or
52.76 - more buy power to cover the potential
54.44 - losses in case the trade moves against
56.96 - you it's essential to fully understand
58.96 - the risk associated with trading options
60.72 - and BPR is a good measure of helping you
63.12 - to maintain sufficient Capital we threw
65.60 - it up on the screen the BPR formula for
67.56 - naked options and again th this is it's
70.96 - it's usually less than 20% but 20% is
73.72 - the number that we go with the
75.28 - underlying price plays the most
77.08 - important role in calculating BPR
78.64 - followed by the added money value
79.88 - followed by the option premium in this
81.72 - case it's 20% of the underlying price
83.96 - you know minus the out of- the money
85.56 - Value Plus the option premium it usually
87.84 - comes in somewhere between 15 and 177%
92.00 - on naked option strategies there's a
94.16 - couple different ways to get to a
95.40 - minimum number but that's how it works
97.04 - the rule of thumb that we use is about
98.48 - 20% but it's always less than that the
100.44 - study we use spy data we looked at naked
102.64 - positions in the Spy we looked at naked
104.92 - short puts naked short calls we recorded
106.88 - the effect of the underlying price the
108.96 - out- of the money value the option
110.24 - premium um on VPR with each strategy and
113.44 - we use this information that we learned
115.96 - above to figure out the BPR requirements
117.92 - for different strangles now remember a
119.40 - tasty you're allowed to use any strategy
122.04 - regardless of account type even in an
123.72 - IRA and stuff like that the difference
125.60 - is in an IRA you can't borrow you can't
128.04 - everything has to be cash secured
129.28 - there's no borrowing money and so
131.16 - everything has to be cash secured and
133.28 - for the firm because there's no you
134.96 - never borrow money to trade options you
137.36 - just have to have enough money to cover
140.08 - the risk so we make it essentially the
142.36 - synthetic cash security all that means
144.76 - is you never borrow money ever to trade
148.20 - options or futures only borrow money
150.88 - potentially to to trade stock if you
153.04 - don't trade stock you're never ever
154.20 - going to borrow any money the difference
155.84 - is you have to put up a certain amount
157.48 - of money to cover the risk on your
159.32 - option trades that's BPR and in an IRA
161.64 - account you have to put up pretty much
163.32 - the cash secured risk yeah a lot of
164.92 - people will mistake it like they'll say
166.36 - how much is the margin for that trade
167.80 - and even you know I'll say it sometime
169.96 - times you know instead of saying what's
172.56 - not margin right it's not margin there's
174.36 - no borrowing let's go next slide so this
177.24 - slide we looked at um naked short puts
179.52 - and we looked at 16 Delta the the 50
182.56 - Delta which is at the money so we looked
184.08 - at out of the money at the money and
185.36 - then in the money short puts you know
187.24 - and and you can see the difference is is
189.88 - pretty small between doing an out of the
191.68 - money and an at the money and an in the
193.20 - money it's not that dramatic a
195.44 - difference you go from
197.28 - 10,900 to 11,400 and the reason it's so
200.68 - expensive right now in the Spy is only
202.64 - because the Spy is so expensive right
205.04 - right that's it um and let's see what
208.12 - the team wrote here yeah I mean
209.96 - underlying price plays a majority of the
211.36 - role in buying power out of- the money
213.08 - value only comes into play for out of
214.48 - the money options and the 50 and 70
216.60 - Delta puts don't have any out of the
218.12 - money value so that's why they're
219.88 - virtually the same let's go to next
221.52 - Slide the point for this slide was just
223.24 - showing you that it doesn't make much of
224.56 - a difference whether it's in the money
226.24 - or out of the money so when we do out of
228.36 - the money calls or I'm sorry we do naked
230.72 - calls in the Spy it's it's it's going to
233.52 - be very close to the same thing a 16
235.88 - Delta call 10,900 just like it was for
238.60 - the put and the in the money
240.96 - 11,400 at the money 11,400 in the money
243.88 - 11,400 same exact thing there's no
246.72 - difference basically for a put and call
249.00 - so you sell them both you only have to
251.36 - put up one you know only have to put up
253.60 - the same amount of money but you get
255.24 - double the premium that's why we do
256.68 - strangles instead because you don't know
258.08 - which way the Market's going to go
258.96 - anyway here's the 16 Delta strangle and
261.80 - since we don't sell you know at the
263.44 - money straddles very often we're not
264.72 - going to sell an in the money um
266.36 - strangle or straddle so we're going to
268.12 - look at the 16 Delta strangle and the
269.72 - buying power you can see on the put side
272.12 - on the call side and on the strangle
273.92 - side they're all the same so when people
275.76 - go why do you sell both here that's the
277.56 - reason because you get twice the premium
279.84 - for the same amount of money the buying
281.44 - power for a strangle is based on the
283.00 - side that has the higher buying power
284.44 - since you can't be margin on both sides
286.68 - both positions can't be out of the money
288.52 - so you pay just that one amount for the
290.48 - same Delta on putting call options the
292.72 - call strike is much closer to the stock
294.48 - price compared to put but regardless the
296.92 - number comes out to be the same um
299.04 - sometimes there's a little bit higher
300.28 - number on the call side than the put
301.60 - side if there's call skew but in in this
304.52 - particular product there's not I think
306.52 - that there's nothing on these slides bat
309.68 - that would surprise anybody but just the
312.60 - the sheer number of the sheer number
315.52 - here of just being 10,000 $1,000 to sell
318.80 - a strangle in in the SP W just is a lot
321.96 - yes that's all that's the challenging
323.96 - part you know it used to be used to be
325.92 - 5,000 now it's 10,000 11,000 it's just
328.96 - based on price as the price got bigger
331.00 - the the buying power got bigger so the
332.60 - buying power reduction is an important
334.20 - metric to measure risk on a trade it is
337.12 - the risk essentially that's how we look
339.20 - at it it is the risk this the underlying
341.92 - price pays the largest role in buying
343.48 - power and then comes other things like
345.28 - out of the money value and everything
346.64 - else but the difference between in the
348.00 - money at the money out of the money it's
349.80 - all going to be very close to being the
351.16 - same thing in strangles the same Delta
353.12 - put in call options um more money should
356.24 - be allocated towards adjusting the call
357.96 - side and losing position because it's
359.24 - more likely get heard on the call side
361.28 - and the only reason they're saying that
362.48 - is because more things go up than down
364.72 - you know well H it has in the last yeah
367.48 - yeah 20 years yes yes for sure but the
370.80 - point of the the discussion today is
372.88 - just so you understand that that first
375.40 - of all you can't borrow money to trade
377.44 - derivatives options or futures or
380.04 - Futures options only stocks B so there
382.80 - is no margin but you need a margin
385.20 - account to trade it that's just the
386.72 - that's the reg those are regulatory
388.84 - Rules by power reduction reflects your
391.00 - risk very accurately and put and call
394.44 - are naked are going to be basically the
396.24 - same as the strangle
