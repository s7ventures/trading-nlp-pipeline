0.08 - profit targets by Delta zero DT options
3.76 - this is in our zero DT series uh but
6.28 - given the speed the number of zero DT
8.00 - trades maintaining high probability
9.48 - mechanics can be the key for Success we
12.56 - asked the research team to say how do
14.48 - you select the right profit Target for
16.20 - zero DTS because that's the big question
18.08 - we get how do you select the right
20.40 - profit Target 18 months worth of data um
23.28 - we looked at everything from 50 Delta
26.12 - strangles I'm sorry 50 Delta straddles
28.84 - sell both the far out of the money 10
30.64 - Delta strikes this this study has a
33.44 - gazillion pages of research you can't go
35.88 - through it all but you're going to um
37.68 - we'll get to a spot which is really
39.32 - interesting we considered um
42.08 - hypothetical traders who would leave
43.92 - losing positions alone and close winners
46.28 - until using profit targets from 10 to
49.08 - 45% of the credit all trades were
51.96 - assumed to exercise or close at the mid
54.76 - price go to the next side Beth so the
57.52 - mid price is a little bit you know it's
59.52 - probably fair so you got to give up like
60.84 - a nickel or a dime so we wrote on here
63.24 - subtract $1 to $15 from the daily p&l
65.52 - values to account for buying power
67.48 - controlling the long strikes to get
69.36 - realistic results depending on how much
70.92 - Capital you commit to your zero DT
72.56 - positions so basically what they're
74.16 - saying is if you have to buy the wings
75.36 - for Capital reasons subtract $10 to $15
78.00 - a day anyway we looked at the most do
81.64 - right I mean we looked at the worst 5%
84.80 - of all outcomes we looked at the average
86.28 - time of the day central time to close
88.64 - the trade and we looked at the percent
90.08 - of profitable trades all right let's do
92.52 - it let's do it Beth got a lot of stuff
94.80 - here there's like 10 slides so I'm not
96.68 - going to go through everything in detail
98.32 - but the first one we're going to look at
99.96 - is straddles now straddles the reason
102.40 - that's selling the put and call at the
103.92 - money now here's what's important to
105.60 - knowe and this is really easy for
107.60 - anybody to see the average time to exit
110.80 - we got really granular on this thing the
114.12 - average time to exit if you sold them on
116.68 - the opening is 10:06 in the morning you
120.64 - can't ask for more a more more context
124.52 - than
125.40 - this 90% win rate you make 60 bucks and
130.84 - you average at 10 you have average
132.76 - getting out by 10:06 and
135.92 - 87% for the 15% profit Target
140.20 - $116 getting out at 1037 and the last
143.68 - one was at 84% $117 getting out at 1108
148.96 - after 1108 everything starts to go
150.68 - downhill so the whole answer here is
153.76 - you've got anywhere from an hour to 2
156.76 - and 1 half hours that's it if you're
158.76 - selling
160.00 - straddles that's it that's all you got
162.08 - you got an hour to two and a half hours
164.92 - and you're on your own you're Flying
166.28 - Blind kind of thing that's the best we
167.56 - can do for you let's go to the next one
169.68 - we're going to go to strangles and we
171.48 - start with strangles and you can see the
172.96 - same kind of thing this is how granular
174.60 - we got 93
177.36 - 93% success rate closing at 9:51 in the
181.12 - morning an hour and a half after the
183.68 - opening at the 20% profit Target with an
188.12 - 89% and the best p&l was at um 1040 so 2
195.36 - hours after the opening the the the
197.64 - takeaway here is that you've got
200.96 - between an hour hour and a half and two
204.32 - hours that's it life's over for the zero
208.60 - DTE you want the high probability
211.04 - success you know and we put the actual
213.32 - times down here everything starts to
215.12 - fall apart later on in the day let's go
217.64 - next we always talked about how you know
219.28 - if these trades work they work early you
221.04 - should look to get out of them earlier
222.48 - too as you can see here when you go
224.76 - start going down to like the 30 Del
226.28 - strangles the time to exit starts
228.28 - getting earlier so this is
231.28 - 946 you know down from 10:08 to to 1056
236.00 - to
236.84 - 9946 and all the other times get earlier
239.56 - now could you stay a little bit longer
241.04 - make a little bit more money sure but
243.00 - the bottom line here is we're getting
244.44 - out early we're not holding anything the
246.24 - negative numbers are at the 35 45% 50%
249.64 - profit targets a lot harder a lot harder
253.04 - to do it's easy to say this right I mean
255.48 - when you looking at a loss early in the
257.64 - day and you know that you know you're
259.04 - kind of behind the eightball at this
261.04 - point you're like all right what do I do
262.44 - I know what I'm supposed to do very hard
264.36 - to pull the trigger at 25 Delta
266.36 - strangles the 10% profit Target it
268.32 - didn't really work out that well but the
269.44 - other one runes all were okay but you
271.32 - have to get out early again first hour
273.20 - and a half and we're going to go down to
274.72 - the 20 Delta strangles this is kind of
276.36 - the area we live in these are these are
279.32 - tough and but you're still to make money
282.60 - you're holding till about 10:30 so what
284.60 - are we learning from these slides we're
286.04 - learning kind of the 2hour window this
289.20 - is our window it's a two-hour window
291.52 - yeah now I like doing it when the vix
294.72 - one day is really high cuz I think that
296.96 - gives you a lot more Edge Let's go to
299.00 - the next one and this is the 15 Delta
301.20 - strangles and you can kind of see the
302.40 - same thing here there's not much money
304.32 - to be made you got kind of wait a about
306.16 - two hours um and the win rate's really
310.00 - high but the losses you know chew up
312.72 - into those profits and so you know the
315.20 - win rate's High the win rates in the 90s
317.32 - so you guys got the kind of the picture
318.72 - here the close to the money positions
320.64 - perform best when closed if the short
323.00 - options reach 20% of Max profit with
325.08 - short strikes 35 Delta to 20 Delta 25 to
328.04 - 30% profit targets are better
329.36 - performance in general the closer to the
330.96 - at the moneyy was more important to be
332.80 - willing to get out rapidly well
334.32 - performing mechanics tended to exit
337.20 - winning positions between 10 and 11:00
339.08 - a.m. Central Time the riskier strikes
341.20 - benefited from safer management while
343.32 - higher pop short strikes were better off
345.84 - being allowed to run slightly longer to
348.12 - collect a larger portion of a smaller
350.36 - credit the bottom line here is you got
352.36 - two hours and depending on the strikes
354.36 - that you select you should set your
356.24 - expectations around that you're going to
357.92 - make less money selling further out of
359.32 - the money options but you're going to
361.76 - take less risk to
