0.04 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.28 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
3.80 - you today February 11th only 3 days away
7.00 - from Valentine's Day not going to want
9.00 - to miss that sweetheart of yours don't
10.92 - forget flowers always work Candy's
13.28 - really good but don't go in empty-handed
16.08 - all right what are we going to look at
17.12 - in this market we've got an empty-handed
18.68 - market right now even the S&P is down
20.80 - four really doing nothing fairly tight
23.28 - range all day today NASDAQ down 50
26.76 - Russell down 19 and the Dow is a bucker
29.80 - of up 28 no real feeling to anything
32.52 - here but you can notice &ps have really
35.36 - gone nowhere the last two weeks sideways
38.60 - capitulation here with volatility
41.04 - hanging out at
42.68 - 1673 basically unchanged near the low
46.00 - end of its range you know what I like to
47.96 - do I always like to go to my high option
49.72 - volume list I like to click on these
51.80 - earnings and get rid of them so all of
53.72 - the stocks that I'm looking at here are
55.88 - stocks that do not have earnings a stock
58.08 - that I've been looking at and watching
60.04 - is actually making new lows is Tesla
62.76 - down
65.00 - $18.70 uh Tesla ivx 5day change up a
69.08 - whopping 6% that's a big move over the
71.84 - last five days and Ivy rank is 46 Ivy
75.64 - rank expanding uh volatility expanding
78.36 - over the last five days even on the
80.64 - downside notice Tesla when it was going
83.56 - higher here uh this time frame from
85.96 - November to December how volatility was
88.44 - going higher and when Tesla's going
90.64 - lower take a look at it here from July
93.80 - uh back in July of last year as it's
96.72 - going lower IV Rank and volatility also
100.12 - going lower but here we finally got a
102.16 - nice uptick in volatility even with the
104.72 - stock going lower to me that makes it
106.84 - sound like there's a little bit of
108.00 - capitulation so I've got a couple of
110.04 - trades for for you I got filled on one
112.60 - I'll see if I get filled on all three
115.04 - I'm a little bit light on trades today
117.08 - so I'm going to go with three trades in
119.48 - Tesla I've gotten filled on one I'm
121.12 - going to show you the first one you
122.52 - might be able to do it a penny or two or
124.24 - three better than I did what do I do I
126.36 - like to go around I'm going to do a one
127.72 - by2 omnidirectional put ratio spread
131.12 - which is slightly bullish so I'm going
133.00 - to go with the 15 Delta I'm going to buy
135.16 - one of those that's the 280 puts and I'm
137.84 - going to sell two two of the 270 puts I
141.44 - was able to do this for
144.00 - $237 you have a mid price of 2.45 if
147.28 - you're lucky enough to see it now when
149.00 - Tesla's down8
150.40 - and change I was able to get filled
152.48 - right at Mid price or one penny below
155.84 - mid price plenty of liquidity here
158.28 - plenty of volume the world is your
160.72 - oyster this is a trade that has a
162.56 - minimal amount of Delta about eight
164.96 - eight long Deltas because your break
166.72 - even is below 260 260 uh is is is just
174.40 - $245 if that's where you get filled at
176.48 - 245 below $260
180.32 - or around
183.36 - $257 is your break even right where that
186.28 - green line ends you'll notice to the
188.40 - upside there's nothing uh that bothers
191.36 - you to the upside this trade does use
193.04 - about $7,200 in buying power it does
196.32 - have an almost 90% pop 89% pop it does
200.56 - have $13 a day in Theta Decay for that
204.36 - risk that you're taking of 7200 bucks
207.00 - does have a little bit of long Delta
208.88 - because I want lean a little bit long
210.76 - Delta after Tesla has gone down from oh
213.76 - I don't know let's just call it
215.72 - $420 or $430 to
218.96 - $330 down about $100 in the last two
222.84 - weeks I'll nibble on Tesla why not
225.92 - what's another trade that I looked at
227.36 - that I did not get filled on yet
228.96 - hopefully I'll be able to get filled
230.36 - when I get off the show here um was a
233.12 - one by what was a another
236.24 - omnidirectional but slightly bullish
238.52 - trade here I like I want to do a jade
240.92 - lizard I'm going to go with a $10 wide
243.28 - Jade lizard I'm going to do the 355
246.12 - calls I'm going to sell one of those and
248.28 - buy the 365 we like to collect around
251.12 - onethird the width of the strikes this
253.00 - is a little bit shy of oneir the width
255.40 - of the strikes but I like the
257.32 - 67% pop so that would be the call spread
260.84 - to a jade lizard the Jade lizard has a
262.76 - naked put component to it what put am I
266.44 - looking to sell I'm going to go down to
268.48 - a put that gets to at at least $7 and
271.44 - change so I can go down to the 290s
274.04 - which would give me
276.16 - $10.10 or I can go up to the 295s that
279.64 - would give me around
282.04 - $11.30 I probably would up to the 295s
285.80 - for
286.88 - $11.30 this trade would have a 76% pop
290.68 - not quite as a high a pop as the first
293.92 - trade I showed you um which is the 1X
296.12 - two ratio spread it uses approximately
298.56 - the same amount of money a little bit
300.04 - more because my put is closer
302.84 - $9,200 it does have 16 long Deltas but
306.92 - it does give you
308.36 - $24 in Theta Decay versus the $13 in
312.40 - Theta Decay that I showed you just a
314.68 - moment ago those would be that would be
316.56 - the second type of trade I might look to
318.36 - put on here I have not gotten filled on
320.16 - yet soon as I'm done with this podcast I
322.20 - will look to get filled on those two my
324.48 - La my my next one would be a just a
326.80 - straight strangle where can you go down
329.40 - to I found this interesting below a one
332.72 - standard deviation below the 15 Delta
335.92 - you can go all the way down to the 12
337.28 - Delta that's the 270 put and I want to
340.28 - go up to the 435 calls just to give
343.84 - myself well I'm kind of I'm kind of
346.12 - really I don't know fooling myself a
348.76 - little bit here by going with the one
350.44 - long Delta instead of going with the one
352.96 - short Delta if I go a little bit closer
355.36 - but I'm going to stick out here I'm
356.96 - going to go to the 435 calls and I'm I'm
359.68 - going to go to the 270 put trading for
363.32 - around
364.76 - $682 or so this is another trade that
367.52 - has an 80% pop $31 in Theta Decay versus
371.84 - the same
373.28 - $7,000 that I was doing on the 1 by two
376.88 - ratio spread but not quite the Delta
379.88 - risk that I have on the put ratio spread
382.32 - because you have risk to bolt sides on a
384.28 - strangle but we're well outside that one
386.84 - standard deviation matter of fact 435
389.60 - you'd be back near the old highs on the
392.52 - lows on this strangle you're down to 270
395.76 - plus the credit you receive which
397.28 - another $6 and change You' be you'd be
400.52 - going down to around uh I don't know it
403.00 - looks like around the the 26ish level
406.80 - where we fill in that Gap kind of where
408.60 - my break even is on the 1 by two put
412.08 - ratio spread those are my three trades
414.88 - not one not two but three trades that
416.96 - I've showed you today all in Tesla and
418.84 - you know what I'm going to do them all
421.00 - but you know what I need you to do I
423.20 - need you to open Move transfer bring
