0.04 - jumping in this is the importance of
1.44 - managing Jade lizards so let's jump I
3.84 - love that Jacob knows we're on and he's
5.32 - bringing on a jade lizard study I know
7.28 - and I and I'm very curious to see what
8.96 - this is going to say because the Jade
10.32 - lizard in a bull market if you don't
12.84 - manage it early you can go from having a
15.92 - winner to freaking even having a non
18.72 - loss is not a winner right so okay
20.92 - managing Jade lizards Jade lizards are
22.76 - an advanced option strategy for Traders
24.60 - with a neutral to slightly bullish
26.16 - directional assumption looking to make
28.04 - short premium trade true to s Jade
30.24 - lizard a short out ofth the money put
31.48 - option is combined with a typically
33.04 - closer in the out ofthe money call
35.16 - spread the distance between the call
36.84 - strikes is less than the credit received
39.16 - there's no upside risk the downside risk
40.88 - is unavoidable at Tasty we often advise
43.76 - exiting short premium option short
45.76 - premium positions well in advance of
47.40 - expiration what effect has early
49.40 - management had for a persistent seller
51.48 - of Jade lizards all right let's this
53.52 - isn't this is great let's keep moving
55.16 - and he's got it all right okay the study
56.80 - so they're using 15 years 15 years of
59.16 - options data in spy iwm triple Q's Apple
62.36 - Amazon and Google that's a lot
64.16 - considered selling 45 dat lizards at
65.88 - every monthly expiration using a 20
67.96 - Delta short putut and a 40 and 30 Delta
70.92 - call spread okay so with that 40 Del 30
73.52 - Delta call spread you're maybe not
77.12 - covering the width of the spreads I do a
79.36 - lot of back testing on Jade lizards but
81.16 - they but they have to use Delta have to
83.44 - use a Delta so if and so with this study
87.12 - there there may be a little bit of risk
89.56 - to the upside but I like it I love any
92.08 - Jade lizard study bring it and I like
93.60 - that that they're covering their bases
94.88 - because these are the these are the big
96.36 - the big liquid big liquid products all
98.32 - right let's go to the next slide and
100.00 - this is over 15 years the study
101.96 - contrasted holding these positions
103.56 - through expiration with closing them at
105.56 - 21d okay so this is interesting because
108.04 - I you and I kind of say you close your
110.04 - Jade lizard when it's going to go when
111.44 - it's nearing your call spread not
112.96 - necessarily these parameters but he's
114.52 - got 21 days till expiration and when
117.12 - you're using that back testing you can
119.32 - choose close at a certain day or close
122.24 - at a certain percent of profit um and
125.72 - sometimes when I'm looking at it I will
127.00 - look at you know compare closing them at
129.36 - 50% or closing them at 30% or closing
131.92 - them sometimes when it's going through
133.08 - that call spread you're only getting 20%
135.24 - so uh here he has closing them at 21 DTE
137.92 - and they analyze the percentage of
139.40 - winning trades the net average p&l per
141.60 - trade and the conditional value at risk
143.52 - the cvar average of the worst 5% of
146.20 - outcomes okay that's just like this is
147.92 - just the setup this we can kind of go
149.28 - through quickly analyze more of the more
151.08 - of the rest of them number four please
153.20 - okay uh win rate spy iwm triple Q's 79%
156.96 - 7 this is held through expiration 68%
160.04 - average p&l are you surprised that iwm
163.60 - is negligible 2.55 five 2.55 no I'm I'm
168.44 - more surprised that spy has a $38 hold
171.96 - on hold on one second I'm just gonna
173.16 - pull I'm gonna pull up his parameters
174.52 - and spy just want to see what it looks
175.44 - like we Talk Amongst yourselves the next
177.00 - one if you want to well this is 15 years
179.00 - okay so this is 15 years of of data it's
182.12 - also running through covid and I know
185.24 - from testing some of these a lot of
187.16 - these a lot of strategies really take
189.84 - take a big hit as your you know your p&l
192.00 - you'll see your p&l climbing climbing
193.96 - climbing climbing you hit that covid era
196.52 - and it it goes really negative and then
198.72 - it takes from then until now to get back
200.44 - up into the positive I'm not surprised
203.88 - now here we have closed at 21 DTE look
207.24 - at the difference now all of them more
209.88 - higher high higher average p&l but M
212.88 - much much higher in iwm and triple Q's
214.84 - spy minimally higher minimally higher
217.40 - but the conditional value at risk and
218.72 - spy went down by 2third because you're
221.64 - closing them at 21 days you're not
223.12 - letting those puts get close to
224.36 - expiration and the they're all over 80%
227.00 - win rate yeah this is fascinating to me
230.04 - so but I usually don't let my now I will
232.84 - say this I usually do not let mine go
234.84 - until expiration the Jade lizards Jade
236.96 - lizards so I I mean this is the one that
238.88 - I will say 21 I'll either close it and
240.68 - then reestablish it somewhere else close
242.80 - it and manage it I'm never rolling up a
244.48 - put we're never managing it by rolling
246.08 - up a put the one thing you can do in
248.16 - these with the Delta parameters Jenny is
250.24 - you could take and roll down the calls
251.56 - if you needed to because they're pretty
252.64 - wide when you look at this like average
254.64 - p&l we've always said iwm is a good
257.36 - candidate because it's much lower priced
259.60 - you're using much less buying power I
261.64 - don't think it's that the conditional
262.68 - value at risk isn't that much more than
264.60 - spy no but you know you're looking at
266.80 - spy which is so much higher price and Q
270.12 - where you're using a lot less buying
271.60 - power in iwm it I kind of like the
274.00 - average p&l there I do too I do too okay
276.88 - let's see because then there's then they
278.28 - they're going to do it in apple Google
279.52 - and some other things too let's take a
280.88 - look so here's held through expiration
283.72 - okay look at this held through
285.08 - expiration you're losing money on Apple
287.76 - look how much you're making in Google
289.24 - but that's before a lot of this is
291.12 - before the split so you're getting Hefty
293.76 - premium for some of those puts look at
295.60 - the win rates in these I mean what I saw
297.48 - I mean you I expected the win rates to
299.24 - be around 70ish percentile right you
302.16 - know 68 70 72 I consider all those the
304.56 - same number I mean I'm not going to
305.84 - tweak those but to your point in the in
307.68 - the last set I would choose iwm for its
309.68 - low Capital usage especially if you're
311.32 - GNA if you're going to close it at 21
312.60 - days and here now I feel like it's a lot
314.28 - different you look at the SAR and Amazon
315.68 - and Google well now they've all split so
318.20 - now you're looking at a $150 product
320.32 - instead of hundreds of dollars yeah okay
323.04 - so let's see when you manage it at 21 21
325.44 - days the sear is still pretty high in
327.24 - these closes to 21 days well they were
329.28 - expensive products I mean Amazon was so
332.60 - so expensive so okay looking at these I
335.88 - think I think the main takeaway from me
338.80 - is I'm never going to let it go past 21
340.48 - days no I no I it's okay so here's I
345.00 - love this and I love this study and
347.24 - selling jid lizards and running all my
349.52 - back testing yes I I would close at 21
352.48 - days but we do also love the zero DTS
354.52 - and the weeklys but it's different it's
355.92 - a different strategy it's a different
357.52 - they're different that's not that you
358.72 - that's like apples and girs those aren't
360.36 - even the same it's not like a jade
361.92 - lizard if we're putting on a jade lizard
363.20 - in one of these big products we're
364.36 - closing at 21 DTE this way you can't
366.40 - talk about zero DTE in the same breath
368.44 - or even the weeklies we got lots of
370.00 - people who love trading the weeklys and
371.72 - I know most these studies show best
373.28 - results closing at 21 DTE and I think
375.20 - that is for the you know these big
377.24 - products it can't be the weeklys because
378.84 - the weekies are gone after today like
380.28 - the zero DTS are gone it's the it's the
382.76 - Jade lizard and these bigger products
384.44 - close it 21 DTE for the best results
387.36 - yeah I mean hands down what I've been
389.64 - loving too is taking these Jade lizards
391.76 - and putting them over stock positions oh
394.32 - yeah like because because when you're
395.56 - looking at that you're getting premium
396.84 - selling but you've got the directional
398.12 - bias in there and then because there's
399.84 - no risk to the upside if if your product
402.84 - goes up then you pick back up to the
404.44 - upside of the of the Jade lizard it's a
406.36 - double it's a double negative because
407.52 - you've got you're you're doubling down
408.96 - to the downside but I do like that let's
411.20 - look at his takeaways okay final final
413.04 - slide takeaways selling Che lizards can
415.16 - be a profitable trade when looking to
416.60 - collect premium on neutral to slightly
418.24 - bullish assumptions both ETFs and
420.68 - equities closing Jade lizards at 21d saw
423.36 - improvements in all trade metrics
425.12 - considered only in Google were Traders
427.00 - holding out through expiration able to
428.56 - make more money but this was the cost of
430.40 - less frequent winners remember it was
431.56 - only 50% and significantly worse bad
434.20 - losers that had the biggest conditional
436.16 - value at risk the next time you identify
438.28 - a good candidate to sell premium but
439.80 - can't decide on an option strategy
441.40 - consider a jade lizard just remember to
443.08 - manage early I and that is a key
444.96 - takeaway with those Jade lizards manage
447.00 - early and I from my experience looking
449.84 - at some of running the looking at some
451.60 - of the test results managing at 21
454.04 - yields way better results than managing
456.36 - at 50% like if you're if someone says
458.52 - I'm just going to manage at 50% and
459.96 - leave it but then doesn't manage at 21d
462.36 - I think that hurts you in the long run
464.08 - well because I also think it's a battle
465.48 - right you're collecting so much more on
466.80 - the put than you are on that call spread
468.52 - but you want it to go towards that call
470.12 - spread so you want to be making more on
471.60 - the put than you're losing on that call
473.16 - spread so it's a battle I think that I
475.16 - think 50% of a jade lizard is a little
476.88 - bit is a little bit right so I hard to
479.00 - get agree so I think that that 21 day
481.60 - Mark is more important than the 50% I do
484.16 - too I don't know that you're going to
485.20 - hit 50% before 21d so just keep it
487.68 - simple 21 days till expiration I kind of
489.96 - agree
