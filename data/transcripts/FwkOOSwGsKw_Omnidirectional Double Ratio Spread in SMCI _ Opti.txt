0.32 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.40 - the bat batist and I have a trade idea
3.88 - for you today December 5th 2024 but
7.32 - before like we always do let's take a
9.72 - quick look at the market see what's
10.84 - going on entps down four handles very
15.08 - tight range overnight of only 10 handles
17.92 - that's top to bottom meaning the low to
20.60 - the high of the Emin snps was only 10
24.08 - points you can see now it's about 14 and
26.36 - a half points just trying to show you
28.48 - that's relatively tight range relatively
31.20 - tight range to the market but there are
32.60 - plenty of stocks U moving uh today so
35.68 - we'll take a look at those in just a
36.72 - minute NASDAQ down 20 just not a lot of
39.08 - action overnight into the morning
40.80 - Russell down 15 and the Dow down 100
43.96 - everything was a little bit green this
45.08 - morning it's turned a little bit South
46.48 - so far uh later in the morning
48.76 - volatility which was lower 1455 a newish
52.08 - low uh in volatility back to 1470 I
55.84 - don't put too much weight in that
56.88 - volatility kind of going sideways here
58.76 - at 1470 bonds are down seven ticks like
61.80 - I always do I like to come here and go
64.56 - to our watch list I have the high option
67.76 - volume list but you know there are many
69.52 - list there's even a bat watch list if
71.08 - you want to look at the stocks uh and
72.72 - Futures mostly that I look at that's
74.48 - this list right here on the leftand side
76.56 - that I keep on mind there's also a Tom
78.76 - list I think he's down at the bottom
80.12 - right we like to put Tom at the bottom
81.76 - because cream Rises to the top that's
84.00 - why you're watching the bat and the bat
85.96 - watch list is higher than the Tom watch
88.64 - list but there are many things to look
89.76 - at crypto the crypto products that we
91.68 - have dividend Aristocrats if you like
93.08 - one of those people that likes to trade
94.96 - dividends earnings all earnings tasty
97.12 - earnings more liquid all the Futures
99.44 - here's your market indicators here's
101.04 - your high option volume list that's
102.96 - where I am right now but there's many
105.08 - many many more market indicators that
107.60 - you can look at okay so I'm going to go
109.44 - to the high option volume list I'm going
110.84 - just going to put the stock up there for
112.08 - you that I found we're going into smci
115.24 - yes I know smci has been in the news
117.64 - lately it's had a lot of movement here
120.08 - all the way down into the teens because
121.84 - of some accounting irregularities call
123.64 - it what you may stock has rallied back
125.60 - to 41 and change volatility or Ivy rank
128.64 - Staying High at around 42 here in SMC
132.00 - High obviously not as high as it was
134.28 - when Ivy rank was in the 60s and 70s
136.44 - when the stock was much lower here a
139.08 - nice equilibrium higher than it normally
141.48 - is after earnings after earnings usually
143.08 - goes down into the 20s it's about twice
145.04 - as high as it normally is but of course
147.08 - it's high for a reason there's always
148.80 - something going on let's go back to that
150.44 - list here for a minute um let's try to
152.60 - find smci here it is right now you'll
155.36 - notice smci Ivy ranked down 11% over the
159.28 - last five days that's a huge move to the
161.84 - downside not typically what I want to
164.12 - see and why I'm going to do both sides
167.08 - here and I'm going to do both sides not
169.00 - in a strangle form although what I'm
171.04 - putting on does have a synthetic
172.36 - strangle to it but it's something that
174.36 - has a little bit more um more oomph to
177.28 - it uh a Batwing trade I'll show you that
179.96 - in just a moment um Ivy rank of 42 when
182.80 - you look at all the ivy ranks that don't
184.84 - have earnings I click off earnings here
187.60 - you'll notice that a lot of these stocks
190.00 - don't have anything that's in the 40s
191.92 - the first one is boil and I don't know
193.96 - boil you don't really want to trade
195.32 - that's a triple leverag um natural gas
198.40 - product in my mind uh very very hard to
201.28 - make any money in there it really does
202.84 - move a directional trade if you're going
204.68 - to do anything in there very hard to
205.92 - sell premium there but you'll notice
207.48 - none of these without earnings has a ivy
210.40 - rank over 40 that's worth trading here's
213.60 - an $8 stock the first one that you're
216.04 - really going to find is s
218.48 - smci let's take a look at that right now
221.60 - there it is at 42.6 Ivy rank is down
224.88 - over the last 5 Days by 11 so maybe it's
226.72 - a trade that you want to look at and not
228.76 - possibly put on we would love this
230.20 - number to be green when we put on any
232.60 - type of volatility trade let's go in
234.44 - there and see what we're going to do
236.04 - January options 43 days to go you want
238.36 - to stay in the most liquid ones 45 days
240.88 - is the most uh is optimal 43 days is
243.96 - close enough in the weekly options um
246.80 - the stock has had some good movement uh
249.08 - I want to show you something here I'm
250.24 - going to do an
251.36 - omnidirectional slightly well well let's
253.96 - see what the Delta is you tell me what
255.60 - what direction you want the stock to go
257.04 - in it's a double ratio spread or batwing
259.84 - trade like I like to call it I'll show
261.28 - you why in just a quick moment uh but
263.28 - here's what I'm doing I'm going out to
264.96 - around the 20ish Delta option I'm going
267.76 - to buy the 62 call one time I'm going to
271.20 - sell two of the 65 calls that's a 1 by
274.84 - two ratio spread trading for $117 now I
277.88 - want to show you a couple of things
279.32 - before I show you the other side look at
280.96 - where we are on the 20 Delta we're over
283.12 - a standard deviation move to the upside
286.56 - that's because there's a lot of call
288.20 - skew when I do the put sprad here in a
289.64 - moment you'll notice that my credit is
291.28 - not going to be as high and I'm also
294.64 - going to be uh closer to at the money
297.52 - stocks 41 we're at 60 to we're almost
300.96 - $20 uh outside or away from um where the
305.32 - stock is good Standalone trade if you're
307.72 - looking to collect a $117 in credit for
309.92 - $1,200 worth of risk Max profit $417
313.84 - that's because this spread is $3 wide if
317.40 - we closed right at 65 which is unlikely
319.76 - at expiration you still had this on a
321.84 - lot of ifs ifs ifs there you could make
324.56 - $3 on this trade plus the $117 that you
327.80 - sold it for is $4.7 C this would be a
331.32 - short Delta play even though your max
333.64 - profit is up at 65 which is 23 or $24
338.72 - higher than where smci is today $5 a day
342.76 - in Theta Decay 91% pop now since I'm
345.52 - going to have risk to both sides you
347.32 - could take a look here I think it's a
348.72 - nice little learning uh uh example here
351.96 - your probably profit is actually going
353.24 - to go down because even though you're
355.40 - collecting more credit this number will
357.00 - go up or this Max profit will go up
360.32 - um even though you're collecting more
361.68 - credit you have risk to both sides
363.36 - instead of one side your Theta is also
365.28 - going to go up your Delta is going to go
367.56 - down so you're going to have less short
369.68 - Delta on here your buying power is going
371.64 - to stay about the same maybe actually
374.04 - even go down a little bit so let's see
375.76 - what I'm going to do here so on the
377.00 - other side I'm going to keep it pretty
378.40 - simple I'm going to go to the same 20ish
380.64 - Delta option I'm going to go to the 32
383.40 - puts I put this on the stock was about
385.44 - 50 cents lower than where it is right
387.28 - now I'm going to buy the 32 puts one
389.92 - time and I'm going to sell two of the 29
394.44 - puts now we were getting around a dollar
397.32 - uh 17 you now can get A1 uh 89 as a mid
401.56 - price now I got filled at
403.76 - a185 I had to go in about two or three
406.80 - cents below mid price now maybe with the
409.84 - stock rallying a little bit maybe
411.56 - volatility is percolating a little bit
413.68 - maybe you get a little bit more than
414.92 - this I would be really surprised even
417.24 - though the markets are fairly tight that
419.24 - you get filled at Mid price in smci so
422.48 - here's what I do when I put this trade
423.68 - on I just watched it for this few
425.60 - seconds I go in at 192 I don't get
428.08 - filled I cancel replace I go in at 191 I
431.20 - go in at 190 I go in at 189 I go in at
434.20 - 188 I go down to 187 and I probably sit
437.72 - there if the mid price was 189 like it
440.60 - is right now that's how I get filled uh
443.32 - that's how I trade my orders I get I got
445.60 - filled at a185 you certainly can get
447.64 - filled uh it looks like you get filled
449.56 - better than I did on this trade it has a
451.60 - 76% pop just like I predicted your pop
454.44 - would go down because you're getting uh
456.56 - more uh you have risk to both sides um
459.32 - our credit received went up your Theta
462.72 - went up it almost doubled which is
464.28 - awesome uh when you're selling premium
466.12 - you want a high Theta Decay still have a
467.96 - high probability of profit you want a
469.48 - high probability profit you know over
471.08 - 65% your Delta went down from 15 to just
474.12 - about eight or so or 14 to 8 your max
476.72 - profit went up ever so slightly I told
478.72 - you it would go higher and it did uh
480.60 - goes Higher by the amount of credit you
481.84 - received remember we got about a15 or so
484.96 - on the on the call spread you're only
486.84 - getting about 70 cents on the put spread
489.84 - um again whether you whether you're if
491.88 - you're bearish on smci I probably only
493.52 - do the one side the call spread if
495.16 - you're bullish I would probably move
496.52 - these up a couple of strikes and try to
498.44 - collect a little bit more credit your
500.16 - buying power went down to 1356 as I had
503.32 - predict predicted but I still like this
505.80 - why did I I mean I like this trade I
507.56 - like the buying I like all those Greek
509.88 - that went up there I wish I was getting
511.16 - filled where you're getting filled
