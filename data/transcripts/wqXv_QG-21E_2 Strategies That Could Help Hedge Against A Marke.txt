0.16 - strangles and iron Condors finding the
3.52 - right size balance as Market volatility
5.92 - and the possibility of Market correction
7.28 - increase Traders seek to minimize their
10.08 - Risk by improving their odds of
12.32 - success one way to achieve this is by
14.64 - selling smaller Deltas such as 10 or 20
17.16 - such as 10 or 15 Deltas instead of 20 or
20.20 - 30 Delta options for example two
22.60 - standard deviation strangles have a
24.00 - success rate of 95% making them
26.52 - attractive to traders who whose main
28.00 - focus is success rate
30.80 - kind of hard to read that bottom line
32.88 - but let's go to next
34.80 - slide on all they're saying is on the
37.28 - platform the the there's a one standard
40.08 - deviation dotted line and then a two
42.08 - standard deviation line that is correct
44.08 - that is correct I talk about it all the
45.28 - time on my option trades today my
47.72 - podcast regarding success rate both the
50.48 - on SD and the 2 SD strategies exceed
55.00 - expectations but the success rate for
56.84 - the two standard deviation strangles is
59.20 - even better closer to 100% well you know
62.72 - on a percentage basis I don't even
64.20 - actually know if that's that much better
65.96 - but it's but from a from a probability
69.32 - of profit standpoint that's what they're
70.80 - referring to so this just straight stuff
73.80 - we've done this a 100 times theoretical
75.48 - verse Real theoretical and then
78.52 - realized um let's go next
81.28 - slide so as expected two standard
85.24 - deviation strangles have extremely high
87.00 - success rate however they generate a
89.28 - lower average average p&l and a lower um
92.96 - return on capital for each position so
95.72 - just again we're just we're setting
98.24 - we're setting the stage um we're
100.68 - painting a little bit of a background
102.20 - here you can see in spy the one two
104.44 - standard deviation strangles the initial
106.16 - premium the average p&l the win rates
110.56 - and the daily return on Capital and you
113.32 - can see I mean the return on capital is
115.52 - pretty low win rates are pretty high the
117.88 - average p&l is decent and the premium is
120.08 - pretty cheap let's go next slide win
122.28 - ratees
123.44 - great so what would the long-term
126.52 - portfolio performance be for both
130.00 - strategies if we simulated an equally
132.12 - sized account with 25% asset Val
134.44 - allocated to each and man 21 days from a
137.68 - portfolio perspective two standard
139.40 - deviation triangles outperform I'm sorry
142.04 - underperform one SD strangles by
145.20 - 27% however the strategy excels at
147.92 - volatility control so okay now this is
152.68 - this is interesting because this is the
154.28 - question that we get a lot about you
157.08 - know what is an expectation what a
160.20 - reasonable expectation of a return so
164.44 - the reason that we put this up here is
166.28 - because on spy strangles if you sell one
168.84 - standard deviation spy strangles
172.24 - um with a uh with a very high
175.84 - probability of profit in this case I
177.68 - think it was um
180.52 - is it 82% can you go back one slide for
182.32 - a second it got to 97 82 and 97 on a two
185.96 - 82 and 97 okay so go go back to next
188.44 - side Beth so with an 82% probability of
192.40 - profit the one standard deviation spy
194.76 - strangles annualize this with losses and
196.96 - everything else in there comes out to
198.72 - about 133% with a
201.00 - 17% volatility the two standard
203.80 - deviations triangle the annualized
205.32 - return on capital is
207.32 - 99.5% with an 11
210.48 - um 11.5 volatility annualized volatility
214.96 - now you know my
217.44 - rules when we trade we want to make some
220.28 - multiple of risk-free rates that's
221.96 - correct two times risk-free rates or 9
225.00 - and a half% is not good enough for me
227.44 - for the risk that you take right for the
228.80 - risk that you're taking but what about
230.48 - if your risk that you were taking all
231.60 - the time was 80 to 97% doesn't matter
234.84 - same stuff numbers are the same so one
236.68 - stand deviation strangle gives me a 13
239.04 - because all the loss are built in here
240.40 - too gives me a 133% return which is two
243.32 - and a half times the risk-free rate
246.16 - neither of those two numbers are good
247.48 - enough so what do you do now remember
251.12 - we're only using 25% of the portfolio so
254.32 - if we use 50% of the portfolio oh these
256.64 - numbers are going to be double them 26
258.96 - and and 19 right right that works sure
263.48 - so this is where the amount of money
266.00 - that you allocate matters because that's
268.40 - what's built into these numbers this is
270.28 - only 25% of your total portfolio if you
273.84 - get to 50 those numbers are F you know
276.72 - five times risk-free rates and all of a
278.72 - sudden you have
280.28 - something so you have to figure out like
283.12 - what's your risk tolerance yeah well
284.64 - sometimes we show you the most
286.00 - conservative case and sometimes the most
288.00 - conservative case isn't the best case
290.20 - the best case might be a more moderate
292.20 - or aggressive
293.68 - case based on where implied volatility
296.04 - is especially like something like now
298.72 - let's go to the next slide
303.12 - so what about an iron
304.48 - Condor iron Condors are highly popular
307.68 - primarily for its ability to customize
309.52 - the amount of risk through adjusting the
311.16 - wingspans and you can see here we just
313.32 - kind of grafted it all out and you can
314.56 - see from 20 Deltas down to $1 wide let's
317.76 - go to next slide
320.32 - Beth
322.36 - theoretically tight Wings have some
324.92 - advantages they're cheap to trade they
326.72 - have a small Max loss per unit and they
328.36 - potentially can yield High return on
331.04 - investment this is all
333.28 - true but they have some problems um and
337.44 - let's go let's go to the next
340.12 - slide we might come back to this one in
342.76 - reality small iron counters have a lower
344.64 - probability of profit and narrower break
346.88 - evens resulting in a lot more
349.24 - losses yes you're going to lose a lot
351.68 - more times yes so small iron Condors
354.52 - have a much higher volatility in p&l
356.84 - which amplifies the gap between the
358.56 - expected um and the actual return when
362.28 - you look at the um width of the Wings
365.80 - right it's um uh it's it's a
370.64 - little it's a tough way to eek out a
372.88 - living let's put it that way it's a very
375.36 - tough way to you get a living now we're
377.36 - looking at one and two standard
378.64 - deviations here you you know two
380.48 - standard deviations you're going around
381.84 - the fiveish Delta option right yeah but
384.28 - these are these are just these are all
385.92 - Iron condos I know these are iron condos
387.32 - I I was I was just going back cuz I'm
389.76 - emails from people like you know we were
391.84 - really looking you know we look at more
393.52 - the 30-ish Delta option than the one and
396.32 - two standard deviations we do go to
398.00 - around the 15ish Delta which on one side
401.44 - might be standing but not on both sides
403.32 - what's dangerous about this what this
405.24 - slide shows that's kind of scary is that
407.48 - the realized return on capital is
410.64 - extremely low on very small iron condors
413.76 - and you're many times below risk-free
416.32 - rates but this is the quantry with
417.92 - smaller accounts too you know what I
419.36 - mean
420.16 - understand that's we're trying to show
421.24 - that that's trying to show there's a
422.96 - reason for doing small iron Condors very
424.68 - narrow ones which is you learn from it
427.16 - it's tough to make a living also takes
429.00 - much longer for these less risky
431.64 - positions to reach their profit Target
433.28 - like 50% in this case um and that is
437.32 - correct so the number of days in the
438.88 - trade I mean if you want to get to your
440.92 - spot you got to widen the strikes that's
444.08 - all this shows you want to get to your
445.72 - spot you got to widen the strikes if not
447.84 - on the really narrow ones it's super
449.92 - hard almost impossible to get there
452.04 - finally when it comes to the percentage
454.52 - return the wi iron condos give us more
456.72 - bang for the buck in the same amount of
458.24 - time yes they're very close to the
460.80 - strangle returns not exactly but much
463.40 - closer to the strangle returns this is
465.00 - even $10 wide go $20 wide you're close
467.52 - to the strangle returns again what we're
470.52 - showing here is that there's two major
472.88 - takeaways from this takeaway number one
475.08 - is that sometimes you've got to go over
476.40 - that 25% number to like 50 or higher
479.72 - especially in smaller accounts to get a
481.64 - decent return and the second thing is if
483.60 - you're going to do iron Condors you're
485.60 - not other than for engagement purposes
488.64 - and teaching you're not going to do much
490.44 - with narrow iron Condors you got to go
491.92 - wide smaller Delta strangles offer a
494.36 - high success rate and volatility control
496.20 - but underperform in p&l and return on
497.92 - Capital narrowing iron Condors are
500.20 - costeffective for beginners but have a
502.68 - low success rate and a vol p&l with
504.76 - limited profit potential iron Condors
506.92 - are already capping your potential
508.40 - profits and defining your risk R so
510.36 - going too small with them is much worse
512.04 - in the long term compared to going too
514.20 - small with strangles and while smaller
515.96 - strangle strategies provide certain
518.84 - benefits they may not always yield the
520.32 - best returns highlighting the importance
521.88 - of balancing risk and reward and the
523.96 - amount of capital that you use I cannot
526.24 - stress that enough
