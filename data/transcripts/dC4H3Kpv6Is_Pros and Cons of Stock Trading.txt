0.08 - so why don't you guys ever trade stocks
2.44 - after it's been announced that the
3.68 - company is a takeover Target sometimes
5.80 - the buyout price is well above where the
8.60 - underlying is currently trading but you
10.40 - guys stay away why would you just buy
12.12 - those stocks there we really feel like
14.12 - you're picking up pennies in front of a
15.72 - steam roller I mean you know and if the
17.44 - deal falls apart you end up losing big
19.20 - and if the deal does go through the way
20.64 - it way it is you make pennies when the
22.48 - buyout price is well above where the
24.00 - underlying is trading the discount is
26.68 - very measured and it's theoretically
28.92 - accurate because it accounts for the
30.56 - risk of the deal not going through for
32.80 - regulatory reasons or for corporate
34.92 - reasons whatever it is the reason that
37.00 - we stay away from it is because all the
39.08 - excess premium is generally immediately
41.40 - sucked out of that deal and all you're
42.96 - doing is trading the difference between
45.16 - the buyout price and where it's
47.04 - currently trading which to us is not a
49.52 - game we want to play there's not a lot
51.64 - of edge in that game
