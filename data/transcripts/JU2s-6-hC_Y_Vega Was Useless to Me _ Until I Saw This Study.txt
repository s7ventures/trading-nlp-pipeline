0.08 - we're doing something today called
1.80 - evaluating Vega what we're going to look
4.04 - at is theoretical versus realize risk
5.92 - I'm G tell you where we're going with
6.76 - this in a second Vega measures the
9.12 - change in an options value when implied
10.64 - volatility goes up by 1% so most of our
14.44 - trades are short Vega meaning that we
18.04 - want implied vola to go down in order
19.72 - for us to profit we just sell pre we're
21.28 - just premium
22.32 - sellers um a bigger Vega means that we
25.96 - have more theoretical opportunity from
27.76 - IV contraction but also more theoretical
29.72 - risk
30.72 - from IV expansion so the most common
33.40 - pure short volatility trade that we use
35.68 - is is a strangle the Delta of a strangle
37.60 - determines how much vager risk there is
39.92 - the larger the Delta the more risk or
41.64 - opportunity we have from an implied
43.28 - volatility move bigger the credits more
45.16 - money we can make it's more of the
46.24 - credits less money we make but higher
48.88 - probability of profit is there a Delta
50.92 - that we can get the most amount of
52.52 - theoretical opportunity with the least
54.64 - amount of realized risk in other words
56.96 - how do we optimize this trade that's a
58.60 - question um
60.60 - how would we op is there a Delta where
63.04 - we can get the most amount of
64.84 - theoretical opportunity with the least
67.00 - amount of realized risk 27 and a half
70.12 - you're going to go to the 27 and a half
71.32 - Delta I'm going to give you a hint can
72.72 - you want a hint it's closer to 50 I'm
74.56 - going to give you a hint go ahead it's a
76.72 - trick
78.96 - question ah it's going to be closer to
81.40 - 50 I'm gonna say 27 and a half is closer
83.44 - to 50 I don't care about you H it's a
85.20 - trick question I don't care okay so is
88.08 - there a Delta where we can get the most
89.68 - amount amount of theoretical opportunity
92.04 - with the least amount of real the
93.36 - options are perfectly priced there's
94.64 - probably going to be no theoretical
95.88 - anything
96.88 - buto so we did a study four uh 2014 to
101.44 - present 10 years 45 days to expiration
104.00 - we looked at 16 20 30 and 40 Deltas we
106.72 - observed the historical volatility of
108.44 - p&l with manag in 21 days and the
110.68 - current Vega in the Feb 21st cycle
113.56 - theoretical risk award forward and then
115.80 - closest to 45 days so we're just looking
118.28 - at everything mhm let's go next
120.96 - Slide the first one so we said with
124.04 - higher Delta strangles we get higher
126.28 - theoretical risk opportunity for Vega
128.72 - but also higher realized risk so wi
131.68 - Delta maximizes the Vega opportunity
134.32 - while minimizing the actual risk in Cur
138.00 - and so we look down below we see at 16
140.92 - Deltas we have um a smaller Vega there
144.40 - have smaller volatility risk because the
145.68 - strikes are wider and we have a smaller
148.92 - volatility of p&l which means we also
150.68 - make less money at 20 Deltas goes up a
152.60 - little at 30 delt goes up a little more
154.16 - at 40 delt goes up a little bit more and
156.84 - correspondingly the volatility of the
158.44 - p&l the risk goes up accordingly they
160.16 - almost look about three times as much
162.04 - across the board there I don't think
163.24 - there's anything you can pull pull
164.48 - across I mean it be really hard to look
166.08 - at those numbers and see that there's an
167.40 - advantage anywhere right okay so what
170.36 - we're going to do is we're going to go
171.16 - to the next slide and here we're going
172.40 - to say no matter how wide our strikes
175.32 - are the amount of Vega we are short per
177.68 - unit of historical risk is virtually the
180.84 - exact same this suggests that historical
183.76 - realized risk and theoretical risk
186.32 - opportunity increase proportionately
188.68 - with Delta what's so interesting about
190.84 - this is you look at spy you go all the
192.96 - way back to 2005 the realized risk per
195.72 - unit of theoretical risk that's Vega
199.44 - plus volatility of p&l is the same
202.04 - across the board regardless of what
204.32 - strike you use what this is suggesting
206.88 - is what Tony just said a minute ago
209.12 - which is options are so are priced so
212.36 - theoretically perfectly and they scale
214.96 - across symmetrically across all the
216.92 - different strikes that it doesn't matter
220.00 - what strike you necessarily use right
223.00 - now it it might for probability of
224.84 - profit of course it might for the amount
226.96 - of risk that you want to take but when
229.16 - we talk about the theoretical risk
231.64 - versus the opportunity it's exactly the
234.20 - same across the board it's a good way of
235.76 - putting it nicely done 16 20 30 and 40
239.84 - Deltas are all the same so for takeaways
242.32 - Vega is a Greek that can be used as a
244.24 - proxy for theoretical risk reward When
246.88 - comparing the Vega to the realized risk
249.32 - we see that the ratio of Vega to realize
251.32 - risk is the same no matter what strangle
254.00 - you sell this suggests that theoretical
256.32 - risk reward and actual risk and the
259.08 - actual risk incurred are direct directly
262.36 - proportional what's so interesting about
264.48 - this is it essentially says you know
266.76 - what do whatever pop choose whatever
269.40 - strikes you want based on the pop you
270.92 - want that's your probability profit how
272.48 - much you want to manage things like that
274.12 - but your theoretical risk reward and
276.92 - your actual risk are direct directly
280.64 - proportional
