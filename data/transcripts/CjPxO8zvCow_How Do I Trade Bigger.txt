0.04 - so I've been trading a smaller account
1.80 - but I'm about to come into some money
3.60 - how would you suggest I scale up slowly
6.40 - would be my easiest way if you're doing
8.00 - Define risk trades that are $3 to5 wide
10.80 - maybe you might want to go to5 to $10
13.72 - wide more of a synthetic strangle maybe
16.36 - even $10 to $20 wide on an iron Condor
19.44 - or one side by selling naked puts or
21.44 - naked calls when you're trading a
22.72 - smaller account and you're ramping up to
24.28 - a larger account the most important
25.96 - thing to do at first is to prove concept
28.44 - the way you prove concept is I mean
30.20 - essentially you start small you start
32.20 - your scaling up process small like Tony
34.04 - said by widening the strikes rather than
35.88 - adding more contracts you add more risk
37.72 - and then you prove that you can handle
39.40 - the additional risk and then you
40.96 - continue to scale up by widen the
42.88 - strikes and then eventually you add more
44.52 - contracts
