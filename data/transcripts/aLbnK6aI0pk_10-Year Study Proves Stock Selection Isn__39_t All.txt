0.16 - why strategy over product why strategies
3.88 - over product so in our research we
5.92 - consistently
8.08 - emphasize the significance of focusing
10.20 - on strategies rather than individual
11.60 - products we aim to illustrate that in
13.52 - liquid and efficient markets the the
16.44 - controllable elements across different
18.52 - products are implied volatility of
19.88 - notional value as opposed to the
21.80 - unpredictable nature of price movements
24.68 - one of the things that I talk about all
26.12 - the time in different lectures that I
27.76 - give and in different um
30.52 - discussions and things that we teach
32.16 - just in general about entrepreneurship
34.40 - and business and trading is most
37.12 - important thing you can do Mr Batista
39.76 - control the things you can
43.52 - control the things that you can't
46.00 - control like what is the stock going to
47.60 - do today or tomorrow or next week you
50.68 - have no control over that what you do
53.44 - have control over is the strategy that
56.00 - you're going to use the strikes you're
57.20 - going to select the duration you're
58.36 - going to do the current level volatility
61.12 - all those things are under your control
62.92 - MH that's control what you can control
65.28 - is really what you're saying here it's
66.40 - the entry for in life worry about the
69.16 - things that you can control don't worry
71.48 - about the things you can't control
72.64 - there's nothing you can do just worry
74.56 - about the things you can
76.24 - control this segment intends to update
79.12 - and illustrate how this strategic
81.04 - mindset can be applied to liquid
83.24 - products and the reason we care about
85.20 - liquid products is be care we care about
86.76 - you being able to get in and out and we
88.72 - care about the derivatives pricing to be
91.76 - efficient across various asset class
94.36 - classes prompting the question why
97.44 - prioritize strategy over product let's
101.56 - go to the next slide so we did a study
103.84 - um four different underlying spy Q's TLT
106.12 - and gold 10 years of research 60 Delta
108.96 - triangles and we also shorted the 30
110.68 - Delta put as a separate test we looked
114.08 - at 45 days to expiration manag in 21
116.12 - days because we know the short 30 Delta
117.84 - put performed really well over the last
119.92 - 10 years since 2014 we compared the
122.64 - average profit as a percent of the
124.32 - premium collected we looked at the win
126.40 - rate the worst loss as a percent of the
128.96 - premium collected and the average p&l as
131.72 - a percent of buying power so for our
134.64 - claim of why strateg over product and
136.40 - product indifference to be considered
138.36 - valid we need to see the following in
140.16 - the results since the Delta of the
141.80 - strangles is all the same the win rates
144.04 - must also be similar and the size of the
145.80 - average profit and the percent of the
147.84 - premium and the worst loss per of the
150.36 - premium should be similar across all
151.68 - underlyings since products do vary by
153.84 - implied volatility and notional value
155.52 - looking at profit and loss as a premium
158.04 - as a percent of the premium collected
160.56 - normalizes the implied volatility and
163.00 - the notional differences takes those
165.24 - right out of the study so regardless of
168.84 - the underlying with slight variance we
171.04 - tended to see the win rates between 70
173.08 - and 73% of the 16 Delta triangle and the
175.64 - average profit between 7 and 10% is a
178.20 - percent of the buying power um the
180.72 - average loss between 9 and 15 times and
183.76 - the average pnl is a percent of buying
185.44 - Power Ranges to 310 to 510 of percent
189.04 - this is all just going to this is all
191.40 - going to validate the whole concept of
193.64 - this is why we choose strategy over
195.44 - product because the product the cued the
198.32 - Spy the bonds and gold it didn't really
201.92 - matter the win rate was all the same the
204.16 - average profit as a percent of Premium
206.00 - was pretty close to the same the worst
208.16 - loss pretty close to the same and the
211.20 - average p&l as a percent of buying power
213.52 - all really close to the same now could
215.48 - those vary from year to year could the
217.24 - worst loss as a percent of the premium
219.08 - because because that probably happened
220.64 - on August 5th be be something different
222.88 - in TLT and gold in 2025 of
225.60 - course but the point here is it's close
228.20 - enough and strategy over Direction too
230.80 - it's just so much easier to do the
232.08 - strategy than it is to pick the
233.56 - direction yes so even by selling a short
236.84 - even by selling the short putut it falls
239.20 - the suit we tended to see the win rates
240.84 - between 73 and 77% this a big put the 30
244.56 - Delta put and the average profit between
246.96 - 16 and 21% again because we've been in a
248.96 - bull market so when you look here the
250.64 - win rates 77 77 73 73 I mean and the
255.76 - average profit as a percent of the
257.32 - premium obviously it's going to be much
258.52 - higher in this case because the market
259.60 - just kept going higher but and the worst
261.64 - loss is is going to be very similar
263.84 - because that wouldn't affect that one
265.20 - big down move but the average p&l is a
267.68 - percent of buying power significantly
269.20 - higher to one and a half percent 2% 1%
272.04 - 1% but that's just because all you do is
274.16 - sell puts in a bull in a be in a sell
276.60 - puts in a bull market the point here
279.08 - being that the spice Q's TLT and gold
282.76 - were basically all the same let's go to
285.76 - next
287.20 - slide these findings strongly support
290.80 - the prioritization of strategies over
293.00 - individual products and the concept of
294.56 - product indifference despite the
296.60 - significant differences among the assets
298.40 - studied such as varied prices implied
300.84 - volatilities correlations and Market
302.12 - exposures but selling premium with a
304.20 - fixed Delta on all assets results in win
306.44 - rates average profits and average losses
308.88 - that differ by only a small percentage
311.40 - across all underlines this is really
316.20 - interesting again because this is what
318.68 - we Stress Control the stuff you can
321.44 - control optimize your mechanics do what
324.96 - we know is the is is the most mechanical
329.72 - and most optimal thing to strategically
331.84 - to do and don't worry about the
333.12 - underlying product those can be chosen
334.76 - by just levels of implied volatility so
337.76 - some of the takeaways the fundamental
339.56 - principle of emphasizing strategy over
341.48 - individual products in trading and
343.92 - indifference of product involves
346.12 - selecting underlying assets based on
348.68 - preferred notional size implied
350.12 - volatility correlation and I would also
352.12 - say liquidity to this this is essential
354.92 - because the long-term profitability of a
356.72 - trade is determined more by strategy of
359.68 - of the then by the specific product
361.72 - excluding short-term price variability
364.52 - when the same strategy was applied to
366.00 - four different underlying classes each
368.40 - with distinct implied volatilities
369.96 - correlations notional values and
372.28 - profitability metrics were consistently
374.72 - similar across all it's just listen this
378.28 - is what we do
