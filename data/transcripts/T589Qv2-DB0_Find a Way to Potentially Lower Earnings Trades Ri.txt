0.04 - Market measure that our research team
1.48 - put together for you how can we quantify
4.36 - risk during earnings periods um we talk
7.64 - about risk is a fundamental aspect of
9.32 - investing and when we get into earning
12.32 - Seasons it's when I don't know there's a
15.08 - little height more heightened volatility
17.52 - along with heightened volatility comes
19.12 - sharp price swings and also a lot of you
23.80 - know uncertainty whether they're going
25.88 - to maintain those rallies like in Tesla
28.80 - they did maintain the rally for a couple
30.36 - days today's day three by the way I
32.12 - actually don't like Tesla here with the
33.96 - help of back testing found on on tasty
36.32 - which we now have on the web platform we
38.16 - grouped stocks in in four groups based
40.56 - on their product and examined how we can
42.36 - quantify risks of earning season not the
45.36 - easiest thing in the world but let's
46.96 - take a look 2018 to present so 6 years
50.68 - worth of data 16 Delta strangle we're
53.48 - going to look at a bunch of different
54.72 - sectors the tech sector the consumer
57.20 - retail the entertainment sector and the
59.52 - autom SE Automotive sector and then
61.72 - calculated Risk by using different res
63.92 - risk metrics and then compar the results
66.12 - it's a really good study the team put
67.72 - together so the first thing we see is
70.40 - since 2018 we've been able to observe
72.52 - the timing of most earnings
75.52 - announcements and this enables us to
77.48 - evaluate their influence on stock
80.36 - volatility and risk by randomly
83.12 - selecting stocks from the top of the S&P
86.20 - 500 that are available in our back
87.76 - testing tool we can perform cas studies
90.36 - to explore the effects in Greater detail
93.80 - and so um well this first slide is is
97.92 - just all the different earnings traits
100.08 - just showing that that we have lots of
102.72 - data nothing more let's go to the next
105.56 - Slide
107.32 - John this is where we start to get into
109.40 - the meat during during earning season
112.12 - Tech and semiconductor stocks like apple
114.76 - Google and
116.00 - AMD show a solid average win rate of 70%
119.88 - % don't forget this has been since 2018
122.64 - so it's been a pretty good Market
124.76 - however the risks are high especially
126.60 - for Google um with a Max loss of this
131.48 - number doesn't mean anything because
132.52 - it's a but it's a one lot of 3600 and
135.04 - significant volatility AMD with the
136.68 - lowest volatility and and the lowest
139.04 - cbar appears comparatively safer the
141.92 - risk adjusted rois are 19% indicating
145.52 - decent returns but with notable V
147.84 - variability so essentially
150.40 - looking at six years worth of data here
152.40 - and just looking at the tech stocks we
154.36 - threw up some some interesting you know
156.96 - things like hey okay let's sell the 16
160.12 - Delta strangle you end up with the win
161.80 - rate of 70% you end up with a Max loss
165.56 - obviously that's pretty high the max
167.72 - loss is a percent of the buying power
171.20 - is um uh 19% the Sears which doesn't
176.48 - seem too bad as $1800 the risk ad adjust
179.84 - adjusted return on investment which is
184.32 - which coincidentally is also 19% and the
187.36 - volatility of p&l is plus or minus
190.16 - $1,000 okay so that's I mean 19% return
195.80 - for you know that's your earning season
198.48 - all right not bad let's go next
203.68 - slide so we did the same study for
207.12 - Consumer stocks which have a much lower
209.92 - implied
211.12 - volatility right like Nike Amazon Costco
214.56 - they have a win rate is really solid
218.84 - 73% however there were some big losses
222.68 - specifically in Amazon
225.32 - and um when we did the whole thing over
228.52 - a period of time because you can't just
230.00 - cherry pick we found that the return on
233.08 - investment was very modest at
235.48 - 2% showing that you know what these were
238.76 - tough stocks not worth the risk the
242.84 - volatility of p&l was 4,000 the
245.64 - volatility of pnl tech stocks was only
247.24 - 1,000 so the difference here is that you
249.56 - made a lot less money you took a lot
251.20 - more risk and it wasn't a great sector
254.00 - for risk return just you know simply put
257.44 - it just wasn't yes correct if you go to
260.08 - the next slide now again we're just
262.04 - trying to quantify risk we're not trying
263.64 - to like say this is easy or it can be
266.08 - done you know in the future this one
268.72 - here we looked at entertainment stocks
270.92 - we looked at you know Netflix meta I'm
273.64 - not sure I would call Met well media and
275.72 - AMC throwing that in there and the
278.76 - average win rate was a lot higher
282.24 - the average um C the sear was lower and
286.24 - the risk adjusted return on Capital was
288.20 - highest at 21% and the volatility p&l
291.48 - was significantly lower at only $1,200
295.28 - the media stocks AMC Netflix and meta
298.16 - were was probably the best of anything
300.12 - we've looked at so far better than
303.16 - technology and better than the Consumer
305.28 - Stocks by a long shot yeah yeah and if
310.00 - you go to the next slide
312.92 - Sean so this one's interesting because
317.12 - we looked at automotive and we said okay
320.92 - well how well did Tesla Boeing and rivan
323.40 - do you know just trying to grab some
325.92 - stocks now you're in the stocks we trade
328.24 - right yeah we trade we have positions on
330.56 - in Tesla Boeing and rivan for sure
333.00 - rivian were smaller in there because
335.08 - it's only a $10 stock now but over the
337.12 - last eight years has been significantly
339.88 - higher uh Tesla for the high- risk
342.08 - tolerance and potential turns Boeing for
343.76 - moderate risk stable with moderate risk
346.20 - with stable returns and rivan you know
348.60 - for lower price let's call it lower risk
351.36 - investment what's interesting here is
354.24 - that the cabar was significantly higher
357.04 - the volatility of p&l significantly
359.72 - higher the win rate was about the same
362.04 - and your return on investment was
363.52 - negative so part of that's Tesla part of
365.68 - that is you know part of that's Tesla
367.92 - part of that's Boeing which had some big
369.36 - moves but the risk return is negative a
372.04 - couple of before we go to the takeaways
373.64 - from the research team let me give you
375.20 - my just a few of my takeaways from this
379.16 - okay I don't think you can look at any
381.04 - sector and say you know going into the
383.40 - future five or eight years from now six
385.92 - years from now whatever that this trend
388.36 - is going to continue what I think is
390.76 - interesting is that there is a multi
393.96 - there are multi-year sectors here which
396.40 - have done better than others but
398.92 - generally speaking the results the
402.00 - return on investment has been un
405.64 - earnings place has been what I would
408.24 - call very marginal meaning that two of
411.88 - them were basically you know one was
413.76 - unchanged one was negative and two were
415.88 - in the 20% range given the risk that
418.96 - you're taking given all the what they
420.68 - called here the variability of these
422.92 - different things there's not a lot
425.52 - of there's not a lot of evidence here
428.48 - suggesting that for the risk you're
430.60 - taking you got a huge reward that you
433.36 - get the bang for your buck the whole
434.76 - volatility contraction the whole
437.68 - enchilada of strategies moving very
440.24 - quickly in one day I I kind of feel like
442.40 - there's nothing here that stands out to
444.00 - me that says you know that that these
446.20 - are great dues and there's nothing here
448.04 - that says to me that they're not worth
450.32 - doing you know I mean they're an
452.20 - engagement tool like we've said all
453.52 - along they're fairly priced they're
455.20 - random they're an engagement tool let's
457.20 - see what the research team had to say uh
458.92 - there was a tech semiconductor okay I
460.96 - missed that this is just an overview of
462.68 - all of them and so you can see the win
464.28 - rates across the board all in the same
466.36 - category the the max loss gets is is
469.84 - pretty wide the um the sear also pretty
474.88 - wide and what's surprising is that
477.12 - before you looked at this you would have
478.28 - guessed that the tech semiconduct space
479.96 - would have been the riskiest and it
481.56 - turns out it was the least risky for the
483.28 - best return and with the lowest
485.36 - volatility of p&l which is really
487.24 - surprising so in other words you look at
489.44 - this and you're like what I thought
490.96 - would be the riskiest was the least
493.12 - risky of the
494.60 - group let's go to the last slide go
497.32 - figure right right so in our previous
499.84 - study we uh we Quantified stock price
503.00 - movements during earning season and
505.16 - assess the performance of defined vers
508.12 - undefined trade
509.96 - strategies this study focused on
511.88 - quantifying the risks associated with
513.40 - the earnings announcements which is
514.84 - essential um for Traders earning season
518.56 - increases investment risk due to
520.36 - heightened volatility especially in
521.88 - sectors that are more volatile stock
524.08 - movements depend on how earnings results
526.24 - compared to Market expectations to
527.88 - manage these risk investors should
529.20 - diversify their portfolios trade smaller
531.32 - positions and use you know mental stops
533.72 - I would say when necessary these stocks
536.84 - the stocks analyzed are examples of our
539.04 - back test testing tool categorized by
541.48 - products and services they offer you can
544.16 - also use this tool with different stocks
546.08 - to assess their risk reward and
548.48 - volatility we've been spending a lot of
551.00 - research effort using our own tools
553.08 - because we want to show you what you can
554.88 - do with the technology that we've
557.16 - built again to me talking about the back
559.76 - testing tool now on the web of uh of
562.40 - tasty trade correct yeah but to me these
565.08 - results show a lot of Randomness and
568.00 - they show risk where you didn't think
569.40 - there was risk and if you go back one
571.52 - slide Johan to number eight slide number
573.28 - eight for a second you can see here that
575.52 - I mean you would just think that
576.52 - consumer retail would be I don't know
578.92 - the most boring of all those of all
581.20 - those groups and it had it had the most
584.20 - risk and the tech would be the riskiest
586.32 - it had the least amount of risk so it's
588.24 - not always as easy as it seems I'll just
591.16 - leave it there
