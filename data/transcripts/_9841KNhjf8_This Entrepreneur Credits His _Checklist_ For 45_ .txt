0.04 - so what do you trade to get 45% annual
2.32 - insurance so I I've developed the
4.12 - checklist sure I was like okay that
6.24 - worked okay I need to add more money to
8.16 - my account how long that take around 6
10.36 - months running your old business how
13.12 - active are you last year i' I made a
16.04 - around 2800 trades and I get the
19.32 - impression you're not just short puts
21.32 - anymore no no I'd
24.09 - [Music]
28.20 - say hello everybody we're back back
30.92 - looking forward to another amazing
32.80 - rising star today Chris welcome to the
36.24 - show from Dallas yes thank you for
38.44 - having me you're a successful
40.84 - entrepreneur you work all the time but
43.48 - yet you figured
46.04 - out how to integrate trading into your
50.84 - business schedule your life schedule you
53.04 - know your social schedule and you
55.76 - started this all relatively later in
57.76 - life can I say your age sure of course
60.96 - you're 52 right and you started trading
63.60 - about actively trading 47 okay did did
67.40 - you trade stocks or things before that I
69.36 - did I did you know um I I did the
72.04 - typical you know thought you know um uh
75.40 - I could pick the the right stock and
78.72 - so I went down the path of hey this
81.64 - stock I feel is undervalued and sure and
84.60 - so you buy it and then there's a 50%
86.76 - chance it goes up and 50% chance it goes
89.04 - down I I played that game for a while
91.72 - and and just wasn't satisfied with that
94.40 - and especially the returns um and I did
97.48 - other Investments well as well
99.28 - commercial real estate and you know the
101.96 - lack of liquidity on with commercial
104.72 - real estate of my mind I give all the
107.80 - credit in the world to people that make
108.88 - money commercial real estate because I'm
110.28 - like I know how you do it yeah yeah I
112.40 - mean you're you're tying up the capital
114.52 - for two years and how many opportunities
116.84 - within those two years have passed you
118.76 - by and uh not to say I didn't do well
121.80 - with those made some good ones and and
123.48 - not so good ones but there was something
125.60 - about active investing active trading
128.80 - that really caught my attention once I
130.72 - saw tasty live let's do this let's fast
133.60 - forward a little bit in your in your
135.88 - life we'll go we'll skip the military
138.68 - we'll skip some other things we'll we'll
140.72 - Skip and go right to kind of you know
143.44 - you running your own business and did
147.24 - you did you actively seek to learn about
150.88 - active trading or did you stumble into
153.84 - tasty uh it was more of stumbling into
156.60 - it uh like I said you know I I went down
159.36 - the road of picking equities and buying
161.64 - stock and and then progressed to more of
164.52 - okay well I I wasn't getting a return on
167.16 - that uh to other types of forms of
169.84 - investing commercial real estate and
171.84 - other things uh the lack of you know
174.64 - liquidity and they be able to actively
177.08 - invest and then of course you know I I I
179.64 - did did run across you know so I was
181.60 - like options I've heard about options I
183.36 - know that they you know have leverage
185.64 - they give you the
186.76 - flexibility uh a lot of good things but
189.64 - I didn't know the mechanics and so I
192.08 - went down the learning curve like
193.88 - everyone else does Biden natenberg
196.00 - options volatility McMillan's book you
199.28 - know um you went for the heavy stuff I
202.32 - did I have a stack This Tall but I was
205.08 - frustrated because you know good
207.08 - material good knowledge but you sit in
209.44 - front of screen and you don't know how
211.04 - to trade yeah um and then I ran across
213.80 - Mike and his whiteboard oh that was your
216.00 - first con Mike White that was the first
218.84 - connection um and it just made sense you
221.92 - know you know you sell a 30 Delta put
224.24 - and has the The Profit curve and you
226.96 - know I you know have using probabilities
229.52 - and statistics and on the opening Trade
232.64 - It resonated and so I went down a rabbit
235.00 - hole and watched uh Market measure and
238.08 - options Jive and uh um and I was really
241.92 - intrigued by the quantitative approach
245.36 - uh of it using probabilities and
247.56 - statistics and not just not just buying
250.84 - a stock and and and and crossing your
252.96 - fingers that it goes up or down if we go
256.60 - to when you started
258.08 - watching Mike originally and other tasty
261.84 - shows how long did it take you before
264.16 - you could um before you actually you
267.40 - know started placing trades
270.00 - uh it was pretty quick um you know once
272.28 - I understood okay um and I started with
275.76 - a 30 Delta put um and that was you
278.36 - remember your first trade one um I don't
280.80 - remember the exact underlying I just
282.44 - know it was a 30 Delta put my first
284.88 - option trade was buying a put in a oil
290.56 - and gas company called
292.08 - mcder and and I bought put at $3 and I
296.16 - sold it for $450 now this is 1980 so
299.36 - this 45 years ago and uh so I made $150
304.12 - 100 and it was on a two lot so I made
307.00 - $300 so I went home that day and told
310.16 - all the guys we were living in this
311.48 - giant house outside of New York City and
313.72 - I told him I figur it out like I have it
316.72 - all figured out none of us need to you
319.44 - bother working again I lost all of our
321.92 - money all my money all my friends money
324.88 - all of everything they hated me we it
327.48 - was I'll never forget that whole like
329.72 - sequence of events make one winning
331.52 - trade figure out I think I had figured
333.96 - out the basically the keys to the
337.20 - universe yeah and then lost all my
339.44 - buddies buddies you know what's
341.20 - interesting is I'm a little more risk
342.96 - averse um in that sense um you know when
347.96 - I placed my first trade I've been
349.48 - trading for five years yeah and not one
352.36 - trade on an opening trade as have I
355.04 - bought options I have never bought by
358.04 - way is is is a sign of a true tasty
362.56 - Trader you know it's amazing when I say
365.84 - that you know I knew nothing about
367.40 - options before I started watching tasty
369.48 - live that's not an exaggeration no I
371.68 - believe it and uh so I you know my first
374.64 - thing is as being risk
376.72 - averse I I just said I want to go really
379.48 - small and I want to make sure that test
382.12 - the mechanics test you know these
384.72 - probabilities and so again selling a put
388.48 - you know was the first TR a one lot it
390.48 - was a well absolutely a one lot it was a
392.96 - one lot it was a highly liquid trade it
395.64 - was it was probably a trade Tesla you
398.24 - know uh that Apple whatever three or
401.76 - four star liquidity trade um but uh but
406.48 - yeah and then as as I was like okay that
408.32 - worked then I sold you know two or three
411.08 - more puts and then I was like okay the
413.36 - next progression was well let's sell the
416.40 - 20 Delta call let's move the 30 Delta
419.00 - put to let strangle it and um and start
423.48 - using but yes I traded one lot for the
426.04 - first year and a half so you're trading
428.92 - one
429.72 - Lots everything's kind of working and
432.20 - you're saying to
434.56 - yourself why didn't anybody tell me
436.52 - about this or where have I been like
439.48 - what was goinging through your head cuz
441.28 - you're still 47 48 got a couple of kids
445.12 - you know you're you got all this stuff
446.72 - going on you're like how did I not know
448.88 - about this yeah yeah well the first
450.64 - thing I said is yeah I wish I would have
452.28 - been a market maker in at the Chicago
454.76 - Board of tradeing I wish I'd have known
456.20 - this when I was
457.24 - 24 um but then I I I started you know
460.48 - thinking wow okay I need to add more
462.36 - money to my account because if if if the
464.96 - probabilities are working in the fa in
467.20 - my favor on these trades um and I've had
470.48 - this amount of return instead of uh
473.12 - investing it in other other investment
476.00 - deals why not put it in into this and
479.24 - and and sure have a better return where
481.16 - I can control the outcome learn more the
483.84 - one thing I love about active trading is
486.68 - that it doesn't take very long to
490.16 - realize oh this is kind of on me you
493.28 - know and and when you're successful it's
496.00 - I own that success like that's me how
499.40 - long that take cuz that's a key turning
501.68 - point yeah it it it took around six
504.20 - around six months good uh around six
506.88 - months of of of of trading watch ing the
509.92 - markets you know uh analyzing the
512.92 - results of each trade you took like a
515.44 - let's call a mid6 figure account and
517.08 - turned it in to with 45% returns over
521.48 - the last four years so um
526.24 - that's average 45% returns over the last
528.96 - four years that's really amazing and
531.44 - because it's not no not a little account
534.44 - but it's it's decent size it's real
536.72 - money and and that's hard to
540.48 - do in the last four years you know
543.72 - you're talking about kind of starting
546.00 - just post pandemic po yeah it was right
548.36 - after Co yeah right after Co um and and
551.32 - so you've had you know you had that
553.44 - little rally in 20 to 21 through 21 and
557.24 - then the sell off in 22 and then ride
560.12 - back in 23 24 you know like and see
563.88 - you've had some decent two-sided action
566.52 - hasn't been the easiest four years ever
569.08 - that's for for sure and I get the
571.32 - impression you're not just uh straight
574.40 - you know short puts anymore no no I'd
577.64 - say 80% of my trades are strangles
580.40 - that's that's the opening position that
582.44 - I use um you know selling 20 Delta
585.72 - strangle you know a typical day for me
588.48 - is um I start watching the Futures
590.64 - markets around
592.32 - 7715 okay that's if I haven't looked at
595.60 - it on my phone you know at night which I
598.16 - try not to got to sleep TR somewh
601.24 - exactly and then so um you know 8:30
603.88 - open uh there's a lot of activity
606.04 - between 8:30 to 9:30 and so a lot of the
608.72 - trading happens between that time frame
610.92 - sure um and then I've got a job to run a
613.72 - business to run so you know from 9:30
616.36 - until around 2:15 I really switched
619.36 - years and and really focus on the
621.36 - business and around 2:15 the market
623.44 - starts to pick back up in until the end
626.48 - of the close and so uh heavy Trading
629.52 - between you know 8:30 to 9:30 2:15 to
633.40 - around 3:15 when it slows down are you
637.20 - trading all products are you indiffer to
639.92 - product absolutely you know when I first
641.96 - started it was Equity Z right you know
644.24 - once I kind of understood it was the
645.84 - same mechanics you just have through
648.36 - Market awareness you got to understand
650.36 - how Futures move with equities and how
653.88 - volatility is different in the Futures
655.76 - Market once you kind of understand that
658.84 - uh
659.76 - you know selling a 20 Delta strangle is
661.92 - the exact same in crude oil is as it is
664.36 - in the S&P and so um that really
668.16 - broadened my horizons and gave more
670.60 - opportunity uh especially with
672.60 - volatility um you know in depressed
675.40 - times you're looking for currencies
677.76 - you're looking for drawn you're looking
679.68 - for uh you know metals and so I I trade
683.28 - all products okay so let's talk about
685.12 - your Mechanics for a second uh so since
688.40 - you were since you've been born and
690.76 - raised basically hand-fed inside of the
694.44 - tasty ecosystem
696.48 - yeah everybody will be pretty familiar
698.84 - with your you know a lot of the
700.64 - mechanics but I guess my question is
704.60 - like would be first of
707.16 - all how active are you because you you
710.00 - are the CEO of another of a company that
712.40 - you have to run and all that stuff so
714.40 - how active are you on a daily basis very
717.20 - active I mean so last year i' I made
720.88 - around 2800 trades that's great uh the
725.36 - year before that around 1,500 so it's a
728.20 - pretty active day yeah 2,800 trades just
730.52 - to give people an idea is is about 10 to
733.72 - 12 trades a day correct how many
735.92 - positions in total do you carry just on
740.08 - average on any typical day I'd say my
742.48 - average is around 30 positions 30
744.60 - positions now you know if volatility is
747.16 - above 20 yeah I could have up to 50 55
751.16 - positions on you know today I looked at
753.60 - the the vix and you know it's it's 16
756.08 - yeah and I'm a little short but that by
759.08 - looking and being product IND different
760.80 - you can look more at so I'm really heavy
764.04 - into uh currencies right now uh short
766.84 - the dollar I mean bonds yields so
769.88 - selling my positions and you're talking
771.84 - my book right now yeah well that that's
774.04 - where the volatility is right now right
775.80 - ivr is high above above 35 uh
780.20 - and I'm I'm really strict on on the on
782.80 - the mechanics yeah and have you been
786.48 - when you say you're strict on the
787.48 - mechanics are you talking about like the
790.36 - the kind of are you talking about when
792.20 - you adjust and roll or are we talking
793.84 - about when you kind of close out and
796.20 - things like that all of it so I I've
798.80 - developed checklist um oh nice you know
801.52 - from the opening U from the opening okay
804.80 - let's look at I have a watch list of 250
807.96 - you know underly sure you know all all
812.48 - very liquid underlyings
815.56 - usually really tight bit ass spread so I
818.96 - look at uh okay what is the ivr it's the
821.32 - first thing I look at is the ivr above
823.60 - 35 what's the five day change on the ivr
827.04 - is that positive yep um um and then if
830.68 - that if that's the case then I I will
832.48 - glance at the chart and kind of see
834.16 - where it is if it's trading at extremes
837.04 - a high or low a subjective
840.48 - higher low and then uh and then you know
842.96 - if it's in the mid-range I'll strangle
844.60 - it if it's like bonds right now that's
847.24 - that a really low I will just sell the
850.36 - 30 Delta put and and then you know take
852.96 - off the call um but but to answer your
855.92 - question about you know managing it you
858.12 - know if the if the call side gets
860.84 - breached I will roll up I'm not as
863.96 - aggressive as as you are on managing
867.64 - the the call but uh that's sort of the
870.76 - the way because I don't like to get
872.04 - whipsawed yeah um and then closing I'm
875.28 - closing 50 to 60% a profit um um in
880.24 - addition to that you know I follow the
882.52 - mechanics on the the size I think size
885.44 - is by far the most important thing that
888.68 - new Traders need to think about how have
891.64 - you kept your size in check with because
894.16 - your account has grown let's say
896.44 - four-fold or five-fold how is your size
899.20 - is kept in check so I think it's really
900.80 - important that you think of uh
902.36 - percentages not numbers okay um so um
907.68 - each opening position that I have um is
911.52 - no the opening position doesn't take
913.48 - more than one to 2% of net lick so I'm
917.36 - you know I and and I I I'm very
920.08 - disciplined about that I think you know
922.04 - you've kind of taught me size kills yeah
924.76 - um and um and and I I agree with that
929.08 - you know in addition that by having that
932.20 - you know that in place it also opens me
935.36 - up to have free up other Capital look to
937.64 - look for other uncorrelated trades as
940.60 - well um so yeah when you think about
945.64 - investing do you
947.92 - still do traditional investing at all
952.72 - are you still doing you know any
954.40 - commercial real estate or like passive
957.36 - uh Equity Investments no I I don't
961.00 - obviously I I have got a a company
963.20 - sponsored 401k plan for my employees and
966.88 - I actively you know contribute to that
969.32 - uh sure I think that makes sense um but
972.20 - other than that um since I've started
975.52 - doing this four years ago yeah um I
978.40 - can't see doing anything else to be
979.92 - honest with you um you'll do this until
983.24 - for the rest of your life you know this
984.96 - absolutely you know um again the
987.64 - flexibility the Capital
990.08 - efficiency you know having control
993.28 - control of opening trades and what
995.56 - trades to place um again I can't see
998.52 - doing anything else I'm going to bet I
1001.72 - don't know if I didn't never asked I
1003.16 - haven't asked you this in advance but
1004.68 - I'm going to bet that the last four
1007.92 - years your success in trading has made
1012.04 - your business more successful absolutely
1016.20 - um there there's a lot of similarities
1018.28 - you know between trading and running a
1019.76 - business I mean in a business you you're
1022.68 - making decisions every day uh some of
1025.04 - those are big decisions some of those
1026.36 - are small but um every decision you make
1030.16 - you got to think about okay what is the
1032.12 - the probabilities on this what is the
1034.32 - risk sure of of making this decision one
1037.28 - way or the other and what's the upside
1039.24 - and the possible return of that um you
1043.04 - know do you go into a new market segment
1045.68 - do you uh expand head count and and
1048.32 - bring on a new employee all those
1050.24 - decisions I think of in probabilities of
1053.88 - it's the same way in trading every every
1056.08 - trade that you place you've got to think
1058.12 - about okay what is what is the risk uh
1060.92 - of this trade what's the return that
1062.92 - you're going to to get for that risk
1065.20 - that you carry um so I think there's a
1068.04 - lot of similarities in in thinking in in
1070.48 - probabilities and risk um and then also
1073.48 - making quick decisions as well um it's
1076.84 - definitely helped you know um because in
1079.64 - trading you may have an opportunity that
1081.76 - exists in the morning and by the
1083.56 - afternoon if you don't make that trade
1085.24 - it could be gone um same thing in
1088.08 - business you got to make quick decisions
1089.92 - every day that affect the the health of
1091.84 - the business well I think the quick
1093.60 - decision- making piece is totally
1095.96 - underrated because
1098.72 - it you can't make
1102.44 - 2800 trades in a year and not be a
1105.80 - quicker decision maker than you were the
1107.48 - year before it's not
1109.28 - mathematically possible it's like you
1110.76 - know it's just just it's just a it's
1112.88 - just a numers scape so it has to be
1115.84 - better you know you know what I'm saying
1117.40 - so that's that's great let's talk
1120.56 - about because I think this is so
1122.52 - interesting because there are so many
1124.16 - people that are similar to you um you
1127.96 - know with full-time gigs whether it's
1130.16 - running your own business working
1131.32 - somewhere else and then you know
1133.92 - complimenting that and I I I just think
1135.80 - that's so
1137.20 - valuable let's talk about about some of
1139.16 - the things that have gone
1140.52 - wrong in the in like some of the
1143.04 - mistakes where you're
1144.84 - like you know I wish I didn't do this
1148.40 - the Nvidia trade from last year was was
1151.20 - was what does that what does that mean
1153.68 - so uh you know nvidia's had an explosive
1156.68 - run oh I
1157.96 - know um and because I knew that it was
1161.28 - overpriced you know I started out
1163.32 - selling a 30 Delta call you were smart
1165.72 - like I was we both knew that it was over
1167.56 - for us we should know exactly when that
1169.92 - was going to take place right and um I I
1173.28 - got I broke my rule of two you know
1175.84 - think one thinking I know something also
1178.60 - adding to losing
1180.64 - positions um and so I was uh really
1184.28 - short uh
1185.96 - Nvidia um uh it was more of an ego thing
1189.28 - I I I you know I failed to close it and
1193.36 - take the loss um but it taught me a
1196.00 - valuable lesson you know of of not every
1199.56 - trade's going to be a winning trade um
1202.64 - yeah follow the mechanics sometimes the
1204.88 - stock wins yeah sometimes it wins but
1207.04 - and sometimes we do stupid stuff yeah
1209.08 - yeah but there's a good lesson to be
1210.64 - learned in that is but other than the
1212.96 - short Delta you know in Nvidia and the
1216.60 - and kind of sometimes our eos's getting
1218.72 - away we lose our discipline whatever it
1221.08 - is what else you know what other kind of
1224.40 - like you know what other mistakes have
1226.72 - you discovered uh turn the quarter on
1230.28 - whatever you want to say you know the
1231.96 - biggest mistakes that I've made is one
1235.36 - thinking that that something is
1237.24 - overpriced or underpriced and picking
1239.44 - Direction uh that's that's the first
1241.48 - thing and number two adding two losers
1244.72 - and to add to that uh some of my biggest
1247.68 - wins were the fact that you know I did
1250.04 - add to my losers they'll mess up and and
1253.20 - then that plays the psychology so
1254.84 - there's a it's a it's it's a
1256.84 - psychological game as well fear in greed
1259.48 - are real components of psychology and uh
1262.76 - and in trading and um but I think the
1267.28 - mechanics definitely give you a tool to
1271.32 - um to keep you in the in the guidelines
1273.84 - uh and and and protect you from from
1276.32 - that psychology you know of greed and
1278.40 - fear what scares
1281.88 - you I don't think anything really scares
1284.64 - me about the the market um and the
1287.48 - reason why I've traded through you know
1289.80 - in the four years lots of nasty stuff
1292.60 - lot lots of nasty stuff I mean in August
1294.92 - we had a 1,700 uh Point drop in the uh
1298.80 - NASDAQ in two days yeah you know that
1301.00 - scared a lot of people um and you that
1304.76 - uh when I was short the &ps that did
1307.72 - really well but there were positions
1309.36 - that absolutely blew PR past my put
1312.68 - strike and uh and and I felt some pain
1315.92 - on that but you know if you manage it
1318.32 - and if you size appropriately at the the
1320.68 - opening of the trade then you can live
1323.24 - through it um and again those type of
1326.32 - positions that creates more opportunity
1328.84 - if you have Capital
1330.32 - available um and and you're in a
1332.80 - position to take advantage of that Chris
