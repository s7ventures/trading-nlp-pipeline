0.24 - welcome to the life cycle of a trade the
2.68 - series where we break down the thought
4.76 - process behind trade entry trade
7.24 - adjustments and closing order in this
10.16 - video I'm going to show you how to turn
12.12 - a broken wi butterfly into a risk-free
16.21 - [Music]
17.92 - butterfly Tesla okay big move today I'm
21.24 - looking at broken wing butterfly on the
23.64 - upside here on the call side do this for
26.28 - a small credit plays up to about the 295
29.44 - level which is basically the highs that
31.00 - we've seen 265 is my first long strike
34.16 - I'm selling two of the 280s and I'm
36.92 - buying one of the 305 so it's a 15 by
41.52 - 25 long to short spread so you have
44.60 - $1,000 in Max risk here um small 37 Cent
49.28 - credit so you have no risk to the
50.92 - downside but really just playing for
52.56 - like you know a little bit of a v Crush
54.28 - maybe a little Bounce from here see what
56.76 - happens
58.88 - [Music]
61.00 - Tesla has fallen out of bed over the
62.96 - last couple weeks here uh we put on a
66.32 - butterfly on the second so uh just to
70.00 - give you an idea of where the price was
71.36 - it was about
72.88 - 243 A5 uh when we traded this originally
77.48 - the stock is now 219 and change so it's
80.84 - down about 20 points we had a wide
84.20 - butterfly we're using a little bit more
85.88 - Capital than we usually do we were long
87.96 - the 265 short two of the 280s long one
91.64 - of the 305s so we're 15 points wide on
95.52 - the long spread on the short spread we
98.40 - 25 points wide so we were using about
101.32 - $1,000 in buying power we did this at a
103.96 - 37 C Credit it's actually marked right
107.36 - now at about a 30 C Credit as well to
111.80 - close this position and the reason that
114.00 - is is because these far this far out of
116.84 - the- money call spread has gotten so
118.48 - cheap this long option is actually
120.32 - holding a little bit of value so this is
122.28 - a rare case or I shouldn't say rare case
124.92 - but one of the cases with a broken wing
127.68 - butterfly is when you enter the trade
130.04 - you can do it for a credit and you can
132.32 - also close it for a credit and that that
135.00 - is possible because of that closer at
137.76 - the money long spread that holds some
139.52 - sort of value relative to that that
142.56 - wider out of the money short spread
144.72 - which loses a lot of value so that's one
146.92 - thing we could do we could close this
148.28 - out for another 30 Cent credit or so and
151.40 - take $66 in profit or 65 depending on
155.00 - where we get filled on this position one
156.80 - of the interesting things here is that
158.28 - we do have earnings coming up so the
160.28 - earnings are on the 23rd here so just a
162.64 - couple days from now um and into that
166.40 - earnings you obviously have heightened
167.92 - implied volatility you big potential
170.52 - moves especially in a stock like Tesla
172.48 - you can see some wide price action in
175.12 - Tesla so we can actually buy in this
177.40 - risk and give ourselves a little bit of
179.24 - a shot at some added profit if something
182.60 - wild were to happen so from other broken
185.92 - wing butterflies and ratio spreads that
187.48 - we've done before the way that you would
189.80 - do this would be to buy in the risk so
191.80 - if you remember 15 points wide on the
194.68 - long spread that means and we can
196.72 - actually see this on the analysis mode
198.48 - here so we'll go to the ad expiration
200.72 - toggle this on and zoom out a little bit
203.88 - so you can see my risk is right up at
206.60 - about 95 right because I have that 15
209.28 - point yde long spread my Max profit
211.72 - would be you know a big $1,500 profit
215.64 - obviously a low probability of that
217.28 - happening if we do get right up to 275
220.00 - and change uh but my risk is here at 295
224.44 - so if I can buy in my risk to 295
227.68 - meaning sell out of this 305 and buy
230.96 - this
231.76 - 295 I'll free up all that Capital that
234.64 - I'm using the th000 in capital and I'll
237.08 - essentially have this butterfly on this
239.80 - equal with butterfly the 265 280 295
244.40 - I'll have it on for a very um uh for a
248.44 - pretty decent credit actually I mean
250.20 - when you think about it about 15 20 cent
252.28 - credit net credit on the position with a
255.00 - shot at up to $1,500 now when you
257.60 - quantify this shot let's just get filled
259.60 - just to get this uh get this on the
262.12 - board here we'll try and get filled at
263.36 - 14
267.44 - cents let's try 15 all right so we got
270.52 - filled at 15 cents so you can see my
272.32 - average trade price 22 cents so I've
274.84 - locked in 22 cents of profit that is on
278.16 - the table that's mine I'm keeping that I
280.52 - freed up all the capital so I'm not
282.08 - using any Capital to hold this
284.44 - position now the stock is trading all
287.16 - the way down here 220 so it's a very low
289.44 - probability of actually hitting this but
291.32 - how can we actually quantify the
294.16 - probability so when you look at the
296.36 - position you can actually use the
298.20 - probability of touch but if you want and
300.68 - that that is toggled here um but if you
303.64 - want to do just kind of a back of theand
305.56 - Traders a Trader hack for probability of
309.04 - touch on a strike you just take twice
311.84 - the Delta right so you double the Delta
314.28 - a Delta of 11 would give you somewhere
316.48 - around a 20 or 22% probability of
319.44 - touching
320.72 - 265 in the next 25 days at some point
324.64 - within that duration so it gives you
327.08 - about a 20ish % probability of reaching
331.88 - some sort of added value on this
333.72 - position right now it's trading at 44 C
337.44 - so if I were to close this position I
339.12 - would I would take 44 cents in credit or
342.08 - around that if I got filled there uh I'm
344.56 - leaving that on the table in exchange
347.80 - for up to $1,500 in potential profit at
352.08 - a 20% or so probably less uh probability
357.00 - of actually hitting any of that profit
359.32 - so I'm leaving that on into earnings the
362.68 - stock has been flying around uh 265 is
366.52 - Within Reach of where we were just a
368.76 - couple weeks ago so hopefully we get a
372.24 - little bit of a pop on earnings the
373.92 - stock gets somewhere to like 240 250 and
377.52 - I'll get hopefully about a dollar or two
380.24 - out of this position so I'm risking 40
382.64 - cents for a two or3 potential profit at
387.36 - about a 20% probability so
390.08 - uh a long shot but a shot we're willing
392.64 - to take for a little Johnny account to
394.36 - make some big
397.13 - [Music]
398.24 - bucks all right time to close one of our
400.96 - more interesting positions our Tesla
404.48 - broken wi butterfly we turned into a
406.84 - risk-free butterfly gave us a shot into
409.52 - earnings here Tesla just reported
411.72 - earnings yesterday after the close $36
414.96 - move I think it was probably two or
416.44 - three times the expected move here into
418.20 - earnings if I'm if if I remember
420.00 - correctly the expected move was
421.40 - somewhere around $4 or $15 so it's
424.12 - definitely exceeded the expected move
426.04 - here into earnings we're now back to
428.24 - where we're Trad where we were when we
430.16 - started this position you've had the
432.16 - benefit of some time Decay and you also
433.92 - bought in that risk so just to to um see
437.40 - what that uh profit was or that added
440.76 - value that came from buying in that risk
442.92 - it actually netted us another 70 cents
445.52 - because we did this trade at 15 cents so
449.20 - uh or about 65 cents is our net on that
451.92 - position 60 to 65 cents so we've got
456.16 - this equal with butterfly now the
457.72 - question becomes a million-dollar
459.48 - question is do you hold this position or
461.84 - close it and to be completely honest the
465.16 - answer is totally subjective now I have
467.88 - no principal risk on this trade I've
469.96 - booked 22 cents in profit covers all the
472.96 - commissions fees all the other stuff uh
475.48 - that some of the people in the chat get
478.08 - uh excited about but
480.36 - for me in such an extreme move my
483.48 - thought is that you know what I take the
485.24 - profits I take the money and run I've
487.56 - added into this move $160 of value is
491.92 - basically trading at at you know pennies
494.20 - before the earnings so I basically got
496.64 - all of this overnight and for me I think
499.28 - I take the profits here it worked out
501.28 - perfectly if you wanted to hold this and
503.56 - take the shot into the next 22 days uh
507.44 - until expiration totally just
509.48 - justifiable and and your risk moving
511.84 - forward is just the profits you have on
514.04 - the table so you have to keep in mind
516.00 - you have no principal risk left in the
517.96 - trade you can't lose anything you you
520.36 - put out originally as risk but you have
523.96 - 180 some odd dollars in value that's
526.84 - sitting on the table that you are
528.72 - risking through the rest of the duration
530.64 - if this stays out of the money so for me
534.36 - I'm always looking to take profits
535.84 - somewhere between $50 and $200 on most
538.52 - my trades this is the higher end of my
540.16 - trades uh in terms of profits I'm ready
543.36 - to take the money and run move on to
545.56 - something new we can even do something
547.48 - in Tesla into the future so to Route
551.44 - this order uh you'd be buying or you'd
554.04 - be selling out of the 265 buying two of
557.48 - the 280s and then selling out of the 295
561.04 - you can see we we've got a mid price
562.88 - it's probably about 20 to 30 cents wide
565.52 - here depending on where we get filled um
567.88 - and you know the spreads are moving
569.44 - around with the stock moving a little
570.72 - bit as well let's see if we can get into
572.52 - even 160 and we we'll work our way down
575.16 - from
580.08 - there we'll go to
582.36 - 158 all right so we closed that we
584.64 - actually got price improved on that
586.04 - order to 159 so we ended up closing out
589.60 - of that butterfly we we started with the
592.12 - broker wing butterfly 37 we bought in
594.56 - the risk at 15 cents and then we closed
597.16 - today for a credit of $159 which Nets us
600.68 - $181 on this trade uh in just about 20
604.72 - or so days 21 days so a nice little
607.48 - trade here in the books earnings were
609.64 - perfect for us they bailed us out they
611.16 - got us extra profits on that trade so
613.28 - it's a perfect uh execution there we'll
615.84 - see if we can get some more into the
617.32 - future if you want to catch these trades
619.28 - live tune in to Johnny trades every
621.68 - Wednesday at 9:40 a.m. on tasty live
