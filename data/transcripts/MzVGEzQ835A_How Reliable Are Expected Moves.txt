0.20 - a history of scary moves where do you
2.84 - think the team's going with this one Mr
4.76 - batist I have no idea I really don't I
8.04 - mean unless they're looking at like you
9.40 - know the five to 10 per moves I don't
11.60 - know I mean it is Thanksgiving
15.16 - Thanksgiving themed you know so um but a
19.52 - history of scary moves let's take a look
21.40 - and see where the boys are going with
22.84 - this one for new Traders large moves in
24.68 - underline can result in the stuff of
26.96 - short premium nightmares yeah like a 50
29.36 - point up move at S&S today after being
31.68 - down 100 yesterday that's not the stuff
33.40 - that I love but experienced option
34.88 - Traders know that it's unexpected moves
37.72 - that are really scary to help us decide
39.64 - on strike placement implied volatility
42.20 - times the square root of time until
44.88 - expiration gives us expected moves at
47.80 - any time scale how reliable have the
50.64 - expected moves been and does the answer
53.36 - depend on what time frame we look at you
55.80 - want to tackle that it's a I mean I mean
59.16 - it's a it's a tough one here I
61.52 - mean how reliable expect the moves be
64.16 - I'm going to say 80 I'm going to say 75%
66.84 - of the time how reliable of expected
68.68 - moves been I'm gonna say very yeah sure
71.48 - 75 or higher and how
74.12 - reliable good does the answer depend on
77.04 - what time frame you look at sure and
79.72 - yeah sure I'm gonna agree yeah so I'm
82.04 - saying they're very reliable and it does
83.68 - depend of the time frame I think the
86.24 - shorter you go the more accurate it is
89.24 - and the longer you go the less accurate
91.52 - it is but the best way to take advantage
94.04 - of it is somewhere in between that's
95.68 - like that 45 day thing I think if you go
98.04 - out like a year or something it's really
100.20 - hard to know what the expected move is
101.88 - and if you're going out one day that's
103.40 - reasonable but you know again it's
105.40 - harder to profit from that so we did a
107.44 - study using 20 years worth of data we
109.32 - observed the realized spy returns at the
111.92 - daily weekly monthly and annual scales
114.48 - using the vix derived expected moves for
117.00 - that time scale we checked how many
118.92 - times the expected move realized um the
122.16 - moves turned out to be and we observed
124.20 - how frequently the realized move was at
126.88 - least one time two times or three times
129.08 - the expected move in Black Shaw's Theory
131.52 - Theory land these frequencies would be
133.24 - 32 4.6 and 0.3 that's one two and three
138.56 - standard deviations one times two times
140.96 - and three times would be 32
143.16 - 4.6 and
144.92 - 0.3 so on The Daily moves and and again
148.36 - you know remember you're comparing this
150.36 - 20
152.16 - 1.9 and
155.08 - 0.3 to 32 4.6 and 0.3 so the realized
161.12 - moves and then the frequency of the the
164.08 - expected move you know obviously the
166.04 - daily moves it's going to be way under
167.48 - because it has to be okay and that stays
170.20 - in line with everything we talk about in
172.04 - the show let's sell the Delhi premium
173.88 - and hopefully we keep the difference
175.84 - sure so we go from daily moves to weekly
178.08 - moves and in the weekly move world the
180.68 - numbers are even we would argue the
182.56 - numbers are even better so you go from
184.08 - 32 to 17 from 4.6 to 1.6 and from 0.3 to
188.72 - 0.4 that doesn't really matter but
190.52 - you're talking about you know again on a
193.08 - weekly basis the realized moves are a
196.76 - fraction of the whatever the expected
199.80 - move is supposed to be so it fits the
202.12 - scenario that we talk about all the time
203.80 - let's go to the next slide so now we
205.48 - look at monthly moves and monthly moves
207.76 - are not that much different from the
209.24 - weekly move moves not that much
210.60 - different from the daily moves and at 16
213.72 - 1.5 and 0.4 daily weekly and monthly all
217.56 - makes sense for the tasty methodology
219.64 - there's nothing scary about this um I
222.08 - mean you're going to have outliers that
223.52 - bring everything into line but that's
224.88 - the nature of the business sure otherwi
227.40 - otherwise there'd be no premium to sell
229.36 - otherwise there'd be no business yes as
230.92 - soon as you get to annual moves remember
232.72 - how I said before when you go out to
234.16 - like an annual move it's much harder you
236.72 - know I can't predict something a year
238.08 - from now as well as I can predict
239.32 - something a week from now when you go
240.56 - out to the annual moves you can see that
242.68 - the difference between theoretical which
244.92 - is 32 and actual which is 30 is not that
248.44 - great and the difference between two
250.48 - times you expect between 4.6 and 2.4
253.92 - that's still okay but you don't get a
256.20 - lot of like two times expected move like
258.52 - that's the you know that's kind of the
261.00 - regulatory threshold the real one is on
263.32 - the onetime expected move because that's
264.88 - where we set up most of our trades like
266.68 - we're not doing our trades at five five
268.72 - deltas and three delt Deltas we're doing
270.76 - our trades at you know 16 Deltas 20
272.84 - Deltas in that range so one of the
275.76 - arguments for not going out to trade to
278.36 - short premium in the leaps is you just
280.48 - don't have that much of an advantage
282.28 - exactly because volatility has so much
284.24 - time to change so much premium built in
287.28 - the first one of these slides with the
289.08 - with the daily moves you can see that
291.12 - the daily moves here at least one time
293.88 - the expected the daily moves are at 20
297.00 - and 1.9 are less attractive then the
300.04 - weekly and monthly moves so when you
301.84 - look here at the weekly moves this is
303.76 - very attractive compared to the Daily
305.92 - and the annual if you go to the monthly
307.40 - which is the next one which is how we
308.88 - calculate most of the things on tasty
311.04 - this is the best and that's why we go
313.16 - out to 45 days because it's just over
314.88 - that one month period and this has the
318.52 - lowest frequency and the best numbers
321.00 - all around and this is where we live you
323.32 - know why would you do why would you do
325.48 - the yearly when the monthly is you know
328.64 - is twice as good you know seriously I
330.76 - don't know like why would you why would
332.68 - anyone I mean if you see this no I but
334.80 - you know what they think you know I'm
335.92 - going further out there's more premium
337.56 - to sell that kind of thing you know why
339.96 - do it every month you know let me try to
341.60 - do the the easier path sometimes the
343.88 - easier path is not the most uh
346.04 - economical I guess yeah no listen I
349.04 - completely understand I think that this
350.56 - is just an interesting it's an
352.00 - interesting discussion and I think that
354.72 - um it explains a lot let's go to the
356.40 - last Slide John do the takeaways all the
358.24 - daily and weekly levels the vix did a
360.28 - consistent job of
362.16 - overestimating Market moves since the
364.52 - vix is compiled from the 30-day option
366.44 - prices it makes sense that looking at
368.84 - outlier monthly told a very clear story
372.00 - of 2008 and 2020 for all three realiz
375.68 - moves surpassed expect to move far less
378.60 - frequently than black shs theoretical or
380.64 - so-called IV over overestimate and um
383.44 - overstatement at the annual time frames
386.08 - the market clustered more closely around
388.88 - around one expected move only breaking
391.56 - three times the expected move during the
393.24 - beginning of 2008 so essentially just
396.28 - arguing that the the annuals just so
398.76 - much more difficult this plays into why
401.04 - long-term leaps are unappealing for
403.24 - retail sellers because they generate
405.12 - very little Theta uh for their buying
407.12 - power and the strikes at the expected
408.72 - move you know lack significant implied
410.88 - volatility overstatement only 30%
413.64 - instead of 32 and the other ones were
415.84 - down to 16 so it's just a study that
419.00 - says hey this is why we do what we do in
422.44 - our world we have to be less right to be
425.08 - successful good job good job about you s
427.68 - I like the way you navigated your way
429.88 - through those slot
