0.04 - we did a piece the other day talking
1.68 - about skew and one of the things that we
3.60 - learned is that the higher the skew the
5.76 - more prepared people are for a big down
8.04 - move and we always thought that skew was
11.08 - more of a red flag suggesting that
13.00 - you're probably going to get a pretty
14.36 - big outlier move coming soon and what we
16.88 - learned is that it's actually that's
19.20 - probably not the best way to describe
20.64 - skew the best way to describe skew is
22.28 - that um it's really a measure of how
24.68 - many people are buying protection that's
26.28 - why the out of- the money options are
27.64 - bit up so high and right now um
30.96 - me just get you the latest quote skew
33.72 - closed 16278 I don't think skew updates
37.40 - intraday if I'm I don't think it goes
39.68 - tick for tick right doesn't it just I
41.08 - don't believe so I believe you're
42.00 - correct I think it's like once a day or
43.68 - something but 162 78 it's a it's a CBOE
49.48 - proprietary U measure of out of the
51.96 - money put and call buying um it's very
54.28 - high right now so we wanted to take a
56.56 - look and see when markets have big
57.96 - outlier moves where's the skew trade now
60.88 - based on what we used to think we
62.12 - thought okay probably means the skew is
64.08 - pretty high but based on our research
66.48 - from Wednesday the AR we're going to
67.64 - make the argument that it might not mean
69.32 - that it might mean Skuse actually a
70.48 - little bit lower you ready for this I am
72.92 - let's do it let's do it so while in the
75.16 - black shs model log returns are normally
77.76 - distributed in reality the distribution
80.44 - is non-normal with a heavier downside
83.24 - tail for which means negative skewness
86.28 - so the skew is an index published by the
88.44 - sibo which follows similar methodology
91.08 - to the vix but with a higher waiting for
93.28 - out of the- money option prices so a
95.40 - high skew means that the market is
97.56 - pricing in a larger probability for
100.08 - large downside moves which is what we
102.24 - have right now but have large skew
105.12 - values been able to anticipate outlier
107.92 - events yes or no bat not a trick
110.68 - question yeah I I mean a high skew I'm
114.56 - I'm gonna I'm GNA say we have more when
116.20 - when skew is low obviously that would be
117.88 - my my way of answering this okay that's
120.04 - Fair um let's go to the next slide Beth
123.88 - hang on one sec let's go next slide
125.68 - perfect so using the SPX the vix and
128.92 - skew we did we looked at closing dates
131.60 - from 2011 to present so 13 years worth
134.08 - of data we looked at when the SPX had
136.60 - outlier down moves based on the vix dve
139.84 - expected move at the 30-day and the
142.80 - 7-Day and the overnight moves okay so 13
145.84 - years of 30-day 7-Day and overnight
147.48 - moves for big outliers to the downside
149.64 - and we examine the skew value
151.00 - immediately preceding these outlier
152.72 - moves as a baseline over the life of the
156.00 - skew its mean and median values were 130
159.88 - and 128 respectively significantly lower
163.28 - than the 162 right now now again I need
166.28 - to preface this by saying there's not a
168.40 - crazy number of cases to look at I mean
171.60 - there there's enough to do this study
174.04 - but it's not like we had an abundance of
176.24 - cases so although it's statistically
178.72 - significant the one thing that when I
180.84 - was talking to Jacob about this last
182.48 - night the one thing he mentioned to me
184.04 - was he goes Tom yeah but this is on this
186.84 - is every you know there's not a million
189.48 - times when we had these huge down moves
192.40 - so it's hard to you know create enough
194.40 - occurrences but the mean value and the
197.24 - median values were 130 and 128 we're
199.92 - currently at 162 does that mean we can't
201.88 - have a down move now of course not it
203.84 - just means we're more likely to have a
205.08 - big down move if the skew was a lot
206.68 - lower let's take a look well doesn't it
209.08 - didn't make sense to a week ago no it
210.96 - didn't I I would have said skew is high
213.44 - I I would have said here is how I always
215.52 - answered I would have always said that
217.20 - if skew is high the at the money options
220.64 - are are are high but the out of the
223.64 - money options in relationship to the two
225.88 - are a lot higher meaning that they're
227.80 - buying protection now if you look at
229.48 - that the other side of the coin of that
231.28 - would be that a lot of people are buying
233.20 - protection which would then if you look
235.36 - on the other side of that mean that you
236.88 - know when we expect it to happen ain't
238.80 - going to happen and that's the point
240.44 - that I think Jacob brought up which is
241.76 - pretty cool let's take a look at some of
243.40 - the research here so in the 30-day
246.08 - outlier moves and and this is two times
249.12 - the expected move okay um two and a half
251.88 - times the expected move and three times
253.52 - the expected move we had to we had to
255.32 - come up with like research that shows a
257.16 - bigger than normal move right we're
258.44 - looking for outliers so two times two
260.80 - and a half times and three times the
262.12 - expected move which only happens
264.80 - theoretically let's say 2% of the time
266.92 - for two times and the actual frequency
269.12 - is one one and a half% so when we look
271.88 - at this the numbers here suggest that
275.28 - the skew in those cases is always around
278.24 - 130ish okay the mean the mean skew
280.80 - proceeding the median skew proceeding is
283.24 - you know 128 130 132 for two times two
286.44 - and a half times and three times you
287.60 - expect the move those are all close
289.20 - enough to say you know 130 is your
290.92 - number and that's two to three times the
292.92 - expected move that's on a 30-day outlier
295.80 - move the projection so let's go to the
297.52 - next one and look at um I think we did
299.88 - seven days yeah and then we did one day
302.20 - on the 7-Day expected move the chances
304.52 - of a 2% two times the expected move you
307.40 - know 2% 3 times
310.00 - .13 and when you look at the actual you
312.72 - know the number the one thing that jumps
314.48 - off this screen at me was that three
316.92 - times the expected move the actual is
319.96 - three times what it is in the
321.28 - theoretical where everything else is
322.88 - actually a little bit lower but the me
325.00 - the skew proceeding is 128 so there's no
328.80 - cases yet where a 162 skew led to kind
332.88 - of a crash type thing it's always the
335.48 - 130 or anything above that 130ish
337.96 - average right right but the the third
340.64 - line here where it says three times
342.00 - expected move do you see where it says
343.24 - 0.13 theoretical and the actual is 4.4
347.68 - that's the only thing that jumps out to
349.56 - me on this screen that's other than skew
351.52 - is that if you're looking for a big
353.04 - outlier move you're you're more likely
355.24 - to get it at like three times than you
357.04 - are at two times you know two times is
359.12 - usually less than theoretical three
360.52 - times it's greater than theoretical
362.04 - let's go to the one day and see if that
363.56 - Trend continues next slide Beth the one
365.84 - day so in the one day yeah it's the same
368.48 - it's the same kind of thing the skew the
370.84 - skew actually drops even more we went
372.80 - from 130 on the 30-day to 128 on the 7
375.40 - day to 127 or 126 on the one day so all
380.84 - of these SKS are significantly lower
383.88 - than where we are now before you see a
385.32 - huge down move the realized um frequenc
389.80 - these down moves is always going to be
391.92 - less than the theoretical except when
393.36 - you get to the three times the expected
394.92 - move I mean it's a very interesting
397.72 - study from the standpoint of you know
400.92 - one learning that the the greater than
403.80 - expected moves happen with less
406.40 - frequency until you get to the real
408.56 - outliers which are like three times the
410.40 - expected move those are how play how can
412.44 - get play for something that happens less
413.72 - than 1% of you can't you can't that's
415.88 - the whole point you can't but it happens
417.76 - more than it should theoretically that's
419.12 - all they're saying
420.08 - but all of these have a low skew so
422.00 - we're nowhere we're kind of not in that
424.76 - range right now
426.88 - um let's that's why the market was able
429.84 - to come back you mean the S&P are up 21
431.80 - let's go to the next slide so we'll look
433.92 - at some of the takeaways here because
435.84 - this is um I think we covered them but
439.44 - let's just let's just make sure so the
441.44 - vix and normal distribution statistics
443.72 - did a good job of anticipating 2X and 3X
446.24 - expected moves but severely
448.12 - underestimated the frequency of three
449.84 - times skew values that preceded outlier
452.52 - downside SPX moves appeared very typical
455.56 - slightly lower than usual when looking
456.96 - at short-term outlier moves and while
459.20 - the skew represents how prepared Market
461.32 - participants are for outlier down moves
464.04 - even at its most extreme they remain
467.72 - unlikely um and realized outliers
470.64 - frequently come when they are least
472.36 - expected I think that's the main
474.20 - takeaway when the skew is lower that's
476.80 - when you get your outlier moves and the
478.92 - really bad outlier moves happen more
481.28 - often than they should the're really bad
482.88 - ones every all the other ones happen
484.80 - less than they should
