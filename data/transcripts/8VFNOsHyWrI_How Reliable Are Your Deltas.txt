0.08 - the
0.88 - reliability of beta weighted
4.40 - Deltas we get a lot of emails um over
8.16 - the course of whatever it is like it
11.12 - could be a month a couple months there
13.52 - were people asking you know like because
16.40 - tasty defaults everything to Beta
18.52 - weighted Deltas on the top of the page
20.80 - how reliable is that number if it says
22.48 - I'm short am I short it says I'm long am
24.84 - I long how reliable is that number do
27.24 - you want to take a guess percentage wise
29.40 - how reliable that number
33.20 - is I have lots of different positions on
36.24 - so so I'm a good test 72% of the
40.92 - time no it's better than that is it no
46.72 - I'm I'm happy it's overperformed how
49.08 - reliable not enough like numbers no how
51.48 - reliable do you think the number is on
53.36 - just if you were say like is it 90%
55.12 - reliable is it 95 is it 85 80 75
61.28 - 103 you're a little off on that but as
64.68 - far as reliability goes it's about 85%
67.80 - it's about 90% reliable we're going to
70.92 - show you that today how reliable is it
73.44 - well 90% is pretty damn good if you
75.20 - could take all the different positions
76.60 - you have on and some are highly some are
80.36 - very highly correlated some are not that
82.24 - highly correlated some have weird beta
84.44 - weightings some are Futures some are
86.28 - Commodities everything you throw it
87.80 - together it's still about 90% % accurate
90.60 - that's pretty damn good so beta by
93.24 - definition is a fundamental tool for
95.16 - managing systemic risk in a portfolio by
98.16 - comparing all the underlyings to a
99.72 - benchmark such as spy we only use spy
103.20 - this is the Apples to
105.04 - Apples um of the trading business nobody
109.36 - else ever did this for retail customers
112.12 - we came up with this 25 years ago it was
114.76 - really a TP thing we were messing around
117.28 - with a bunch of different tools T TP
120.00 - came up with the idea of beta waiting a
121.68 - portfolio for retail investors we
123.96 - started it we've um kept it you can get
126.84 - this at thinkers slum now you can get
128.32 - this obviously a tasty and maybe there's
131.00 - like maybe another firm I I'm not sure
132.60 - if interactive brokers has it but we
134.48 - changed the whole industry with respect
136.12 - to active Traders using beta weed
138.36 - portfolios there are two equivalent
140.60 - definitions for beta of an
143.24 - underlying
144.84 - um and we get into a lot of the formulas
149.24 - here because we have some physicists and
151.80 - some math professors and other things
154.24 - and people want to see you know the
156.16 - actual um formulas that we're using to
159.28 - create um uh to basically create the
163.56 - definitions that we use on the platform
166.72 - but what what we wrote here is more
169.76 - intuitively this is thought of as how
173.08 - much to expect ABC stock to move given a
176.80 - $1 move in the underline that's our beta
180.16 - waiting and how
182.40 - reliable is this expectation or how
185.84 - reliably does this expectation play out
188.48 - in reality so we use 15 years worth of
192.36 - data which is plenty spies iwm TLT Q's
196.56 - Amazon Google and Tesla for each day in
199.40 - the past 10 years we computed the betas
203.32 - the
204.08 - beta beta weighted Deltas based on the
206.96 - previous 5 years of returns the same
209.00 - methodology as the platforms I'm sorry
211.04 - these are just beta values we contrasted
214.44 - that's just the relationship between the
216.12 - underlying and the snps we contrasted
218.88 - the realized daily moves against those
220.48 - predicted by Beta and the Spy moves via
223.08 - the correlation the average absolute
225.60 - eror as a percent of the daily move and
227.92 - its root mean era similar metric but
230.92 - which penalizes large errors more for
233.96 - context we reported on the correlation
235.80 - between each underlying and the Spy over
237.64 - the whole of the data set
240.48 - again I don't I'm not sure anybody's
242.12 - ever done anything like this before but
244.92 - welcome to Tasty this is actually fairly
247.32 - ground breaking in the sense that I
249.84 - haven't seen this study before anywhere
252.84 - so the correlation with spy if used iwm
255.60 - is 88 and no surprise there if you use
258.08 - Q's .93 no surprise there this is over
261.68 - 15 years TLT it would obviously be the
264.56 - inverse so it's a
266.80 - .32 those all make sense the correl
270.08 - between predicted and realized moves is
273.32 - actually almost what just what you
275.60 - thought um you know it's it's pretty
278.60 - damn close to the to the to the actual
281.64 - correlation with the Spy no surprise
283.96 - there because the numbers work the math
286.72 - just works but here's where we get down
288.76 - to kind of let's talk about the average
291.60 - error it's a percent of the average move
294.56 - so in iwm it's 7.7 in TLT 12.2 and the
299.20 - q's
300.24 - 4.2 so when you think about these these
302.48 - errors are relatively
305.48 - small I mean TLT little bit more but
308.80 - mostly all of our stuff is in stock
310.52 - indices and stock indices it's closer to
312.72 - 5% which means that the beta way dels is
315.16 - like 95% accurate when you look at the
317.08 - big outlier moves which is the root mean
319.72 - Square era they're a little bit higher
322.24 - in iwm and qes but it still basically
325.24 - averages under 10% about 8% so for the
328.84 - outliers so this is really interesting
331.16 - in this sense that the average
334.56 - ERA is pretty low now if we go to
338.16 - different equities go to the next Slide
339.68 - John so Amazon Google and Tesla are
342.04 - equities they only have
343.72 - a
345.72 - 6.69 and 044 correlation to the snps so
350.16 - their correlation is much lower when you
352.32 - have a lower correlation you're
353.44 - obviously going to have
355.12 - higher uh higher error count because
359.12 - because that that's just the way marks
360.60 - work if there's a lower correlation then
362.72 - then everything is going to be a little
364.68 - less IM balance the correlation between
366.88 - the predicted and the real moves spot on
369.76 - freaking spot on Amazing the average
372.28 - error here is a little higher than the
374.00 - indexes of the last slide Amazon 84
376.88 - google2 I mean 12.3 and Tesla 9.3 and
381.52 - then the outlier moves even a little bit
383.60 - greater as well but still pretty well
386.00 - under
387.08 - 10% which means that the number that we
389.84 - show on the platform you know as far as
392.36 - our beta weighted um as far as our beta
395.92 - weighted deltas and our Greeks are
398.00 - pretty damn
399.36 - good very nice agree I mean like in my
402.24 - account I'm taking you know 70 or 80
404.52 - different positions beta weting them to
406.60 - the Spy and coming up with something
407.92 - that has uh an error less than 10% I
412.04 - feel pretty good about that I don't
414.52 - think I could come up with better let me
415.84 - put it to you that
417.04 - way no um that's really interesting
420.64 - that's really really interesting really
422.72 - well done beta weighted Deltas give us
425.32 - an apples to app's way to look at the
426.88 - total systemic risk across our portfolio
429.40 - how much do we expect to gain or lose
431.08 - from a $1 move in the market but the
433.12 - value of that expectation is closely
434.68 - matched with the strength of each
435.84 - underlying Market correlation so less
438.48 - correlated more wiggle room for error
441.68 - typically realized price changes were
444.76 - within 10% of the values predicted by
447.88 - Beta although Q stayed much closer and
451.00 - the lower correlations underlyings had
452.76 - noticeably higher root mean Square
455.48 - errors which meaning they most likely
457.24 - kept they're close to the beta um
460.48 - weighted Delta predictions when they
462.76 - varied they varied big and low
465.64 - correlation underlyings are the key for
467.00 - increase in the number of occurrences
468.60 - but be careful because their beta
470.68 - weighted Deltas are small it doesn't
473.04 - mean that their prices are stable just
475.32 - that their moves are hard to predict
476.96 - there's a lot of good stuff yeah a
479.68 - pretty good little tidbit there too so
481.48 - really good at predicting the the
483.68 - typical move that the stock is going to
485.92 - have but no way of predicting the
487.80 - outlier move and that's why they call it
489.16 - an outlier move right I mean that's
490.36 - really what they're saying yeah don't
491.44 - don't sleep on this study this is good
