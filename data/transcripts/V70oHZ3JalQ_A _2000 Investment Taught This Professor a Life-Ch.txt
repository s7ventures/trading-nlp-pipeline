74.92 - was like okay I remember having somebody
78.40 - at dinner that we I was talking to that

101.56 - the you know all that history there so
103.56 - you know plenty about us um to give
106.24 - everybody a little background because
107.72 - I'm not sure what's popping up on their
109.24 - screen but um civil engineering degree
112.04 - from Virginia Tech Master's in finance
114.36 - from Georgetown um and one of the key
117.80 - that they have marked for me is that you
119.68 - are the proud owner of a number Cherry
121.76 - pin I am well wore wore it here today
125.08 - back when I think I have a cherry pin on
126.44 - right now yes uh nice oh and opening
129.12 - account that was one of the the things
130.72 - that you got back then there you go and
132.44 - you wear proudly I like it and before we
135.04 - get into kind of you know some of your
137.24 - results and some of your stuff I'm I'm
140.08 - really fascinated by so you're an
141.92 - engineer MH you you also you're an
144.76 - entrepreneur yeah you and and you're
147.92 - also teach at two un ities Virginia Tech
151.04 - in in Georgetown correct so you're
154.28 - you're kind of like a techie
157.80 - engineer and then you're also you've got
160.88 - all this other entrepreneur stuff going
163.60 - on in addition to you know you're
166.36 - trading um how much time do you spend
169.24 - watching
170.12 - markets uh I was I was telling uh some
172.60 - of the the team out there uh this
174.68 - morning I I'll have the show on live
177.28 - show on almost every day uh for the
179.48 - first 3 or 4 hours um there's always a
182.16 - screen that I have up that has my
183.80 - account on there just to watch uh nice
186.20 - yeah we can get into the trading a
187.28 - little later you know I don't trade all
189.12 - that actively decently so but um it's
192.84 - it's an awareness thing for me uh it has
194.96 - so much context in a lot of the work I
198.28 - do outside of trading so so what does
200.16 - that mean I mean explain I'll go on a
202.28 - little tangent but I'll answer your
203.40 - question that sure in the uh one of the
205.12 - graduate courses it's a foundations of
206.72 - Finance I mean npv you know formula
209.92 - basic let's talk about time value of
211.96 - money okay um and we have a discussion
214.64 - about well what what sets the time value
216.44 - interest rates you know where are they
217.64 - what do they come from how are they set
219.40 - you know who who determines them what's
220.92 - the the pull them uh and we probably
224.36 - wouldn't surprise you but the vast
225.84 - majority of of students you know don't
228.24 - have that context to the bond market and
231.44 - have never traded a bond or note and
233.76 - don't know what any of the spreads are
235.76 - and you know it's the interest rates is
237.08 - something the bank sets and uh you know
239.80 - get into the next question of well where
240.92 - rate's going and well I don't I don't
242.76 - know well actually yeah there's an
244.44 - entire Market that's do you tell do you
247.08 - tell your students that you trade the
249.32 - markets yeah we get there you you get
251.28 - there yeah okay because I think it
255.00 - probably I I I wish I had professors
257.96 - that well I don't know how easy would
259.84 - have been to trade back then but I kind
262.24 - of feel like I wish professors would
264.48 - trade and then I wish they would tell
266.20 - the students that they trade because
267.68 - that kind of that that it means a lot
269.76 - lot more I actually true story in in an
271.64 - underr class I actually had a student
273.08 - come up and asked if I've ever heard of
274.32 - tasty trade and tasty live he he was a
277.16 - watcher and and was just started traing
279.64 - when we started talking about options it
281.08 - like peaked his you he's like wait I I
282.76 - know that let me come talk to you about
284.80 - it so yeah they're out there but uh the
287.84 - context it just you have to um try to
291.68 - put it in perspective of of whatever
293.72 - environment we're in and especially in
295.60 - real estate which is a lot of the focus
297.08 - of what those Master's classes are on
299.48 - and
300.56 - it provides that you know yeah the only
302.44 - problem with real estate that the only
304.08 - there's many problems well yeah yeah I
306.72 - guess as somebody who's trying to sell a
308.68 - building right now sure but um one of
311.48 - the great things about trading for me is
313.20 - that that it's it's actually something
316.04 - that that it's actionable because of the
318.84 - liquidity in the markets and real estate
321.80 - as as much fun as it sounds like on
324.64 - paper sometimes it's not actionable
327.12 - because there is no liquidity yeah so
329.00 - it's you know correct you could have the
330.52 - you you could have the best building in
333.32 - the city but if you can't transact
335.20 - doesn't matter you're I mean you're so
336.80 - dependent on on you
339.00 - know unlisted financial markets well
341.48 - even non-listed markets they
343.92 - they're regardless of what what's
346.08 - happening there's a bid and an offer and
348.28 - there's some Market somewhere could be
349.64 - wide but there's a market well or or or
351.72 - it could be very low and unattractive it
354.36 - could be high but there's a market
356.16 - there's not always a market in
357.24 - everything else and so the the con
359.64 - concept of liquidity is is quite foreign
362.76 - to um to a lot of people when they think
365.40 - about taking risk and that's one of the
367.60 - things I I just love to hammer home you
370.08 - know um to give to providing context in
373.48 - in your teaching do you think that
374.96 - trading has played a a similar role in
378.36 - you know the entrepreneurial Ventures
380.60 - that you have and in the engineering
383.00 - side of the business that you're you
384.24 - know you're principal in absolutely um
387.20 - trading has taught uh I don't want to
390.24 - call instant decisions but instant
392.40 - decisions you know like you have to make
394.68 - uh with the information you have with
396.32 - the risk you're willing to take on you
398.08 - know do you get in a position or not um
400.52 - that is every day of owning and running
402.64 - a business assessing risk and making
405.28 - quick decisions is something that I
407.56 - preach non-stop but sometimes people
410.16 - have a hard time like hearing that and
413.36 - actually wondering how they're going to
414.92 - apply that yeah there's I mean there's
417.04 - decision Paralysis on so many things in
419.24 - life
420.44 - you can't have that in running a
422.24 - business doesn't mean you're always
423.20 - making the right decision no you don't
425.40 - have to always make the right decision
427.00 - you just have to make a decision correct
428.64 - there's nothing worse than not making a
430.92 - decision but I don't care if you're
432.80 - right just make the damn decision just
434.60 - just pick pick a away and and figure it
436.20 - out later you you'd be surprised but
438.44 - you're going to be right a majority of
440.68 - the time because that's just the way
442.48 - everything works the the uh the favors
447.72 - go to those who make the quickest
450.44 - decisions and for whatever reason it
453.28 - just works out that way um so let's get
457.16 - into trading yeah when did you actually
459.76 - start trading uh I opened first account
463.00 - when tasty works with the time now tasty
465.40 - trade uh had you done anything before
468.00 - 200 yeah I I um opened my first stock
472.04 - brokerage with with Fidelity when I
474.28 - turned 18 okay to invest I mean I wasn't
477.52 - it was never a day trade never uh you
479.60 - know try to speculate um there were no I
482.68 - didn't do options at that time what did
484.72 - you do did just buy stocks just buy
486.40 - stocks I mean that was back when you
488.32 - paid uh like $10 a trading
491.16 - commission commission every time just to
493.64 - enter and exit position and yeah
495.64 - couldn't couldn't do much with that um
497.72 - but it was just to to get in uh you my
499.56 - my dad was in finance uh so I was aware
502.88 - of it um when's your dad due uh now long
506.20 - since retired but um was in higher
507.96 - education Finance got it so he was a
510.52 - professor no uh on the administrative
512.56 - side he has PhD but he was
514.84 - administrative Side Run uh College
517.68 - finances um Cornell some Pennsylvania
519.84 - schools got it so you were Finance yeah
523.04 - my dad was a um uh didn't believe in
526.60 - stocks so it's very hard for me to make
528.68 - the transition because he's like had to
531.56 - relearn yeah smart guy but uh not didn't
535.00 - believe in the stock market um the so
539.20 - your first Venture was just kind of
541.96 - traditional passive buy few shares here
544.96 - or there yeah put put in the mutual fund
547.12 - the the you know set it and forget it
548.92 - stuff set it and forget it go to sleep
550.12 - for 45 50 years and hope when you wake
551.88 - up it's going to be significantly higher
553.96 - yeah still have that account still have
555.76 - the accounts it's higher you know
558.40 - through no efforts of my own um but uh
562.00 - you you said at some point one of your
564.20 - your segments long ago that like you
565.60 - know you don't know how you can sleep at
566.72 - night with that because you know you
568.68 - don't know what risk has on yeah
570.96 - actually that that doesn't bother me
574.32 - sleeping at night with a passive account
577.20 - doesn't it I'm not I don't worry about
578.76 - that from a risk perspective I worry
580.76 - about that from a from a knowhow
582.72 - perspective I worry about that there's
584.52 - no KN there is no noow exactly I worry
586.24 - about that from from what's going to
588.36 - happen in you know in 20 years when
590.80 - you're when you know just as much as you
592.92 - know today and you know you haven't
594.84 - figured anything out you know you
595.80 - haven't experienced anything that's what
597.48 - I worry about yeah um
600.04 - so you start watching tasty in 2012 did
604.48 - you start trading options then or you
606.92 - waited uh I I'll say I paper traded um I
610.72 - had I had the theory in my head CU I was
612.28 - teaching at the time okay my first
614.20 - introduction options was actually
615.64 - academically uh when I was going through
617.32 - my mattress program okay they had a
619.20 - professor who we had to draw out the the
621.92 - option payoff diagrams by hand and
624.44 - understand how these things got put
626.20 - together uh and and something it just
628.44 - kind of clicked with something something
629.96 - yeah wait a minute I can I can quantify
632.28 - the risk and I can uh hedge it in the
634.68 - light so it's not financially hedged but
636.32 - I can I can compartmentalize it um and
639.36 - so then I said all right let me let me
640.88 - start to see what's going on and uh
643.40 - through a front of a friend I was
644.44 - actually on a golf course of all places
645.96 - where I when I first heard the the name
647.56 - tasty trade and uh at the you know the
650.24 - live show at the time and started
652.20 - watching it and you and Tony and
654.28 - figuring out what all that chaos was
655.80 - about but eventually it made sense once
657.48 - you once you got a few episodes and yeah
660.60 - yeah it wasn't it's not something you
662.08 - just turn on and go okay I'll just watch
664.28 - this for the rest of my life yeah so far
666.36 - we're in yeah that's great and um so
670.40 - you're messing around you're paper
671.68 - trading and you're kind of figuring it
674.44 - out kind of and you opened one of the
677.52 - first tasty trade accounts was that the
679.24 - first time you ventured into listed
682.20 - options no so I had cuz I had the
684.36 - Fidelity account for forever um I had
687.20 - got approved on Fidelity to to go
689.52 - through their options and uh not to for
692.48 - those with vality accounts I'm sure
693.72 - they're they're quite happy there but it
695.88 - was a process uh don't don't even don't
698.28 - even get me started yeah there's
699.76 - multiple levels well they don't love me
701.40 - so it's okay I'm good don't worry about
703.04 - it then uh I I traded a couple options
706.84 - at the Fidelity account with what
708.44 - limited Authority and permissions I was
710.40 - allowed to do uh and it kind of made
713.44 - sense um but you know it was a it was
716.72 - not easy to do there was some friction
719.60 - on uh the execution did it bother you
722.40 - that you're restricted from C doing
724.20 - certain things or you didn't realize at
725.36 - the time no it I I very much realize it
728.24 - it it confused me while the restrictions
731.00 - were there um yeah you had to interview
733.76 - to to trade your own money in a way yeah
736.24 - of course um and I'm sure you can make
738.68 - an argument from a firm perspective but
740.36 - we won't go down that rabbit hole no no
742.28 - sure uh and that's when uh you you were
745.60 - launching again tasty works the trading
747.96 - platform at the time and yeah said yeah
749.48 - this is this I like what I hear and this
752.48 - uh this is built by people who are going
753.84 - to click the button so I'll give it a
755.64 - try and and have it look back perfect do
757.92 - you remember what you first did when you
759.08 - started out trading I think that was
760.60 - like that was 2017 mhm yeah open the
763.88 - account and I didn't do anything let
766.28 - left the money sit there for for you
767.72 - know probably a week or two okay uh yeah
770.00 - it's it's one of the things when you get
771.08 - the new car you don't drive it right
772.20 - away yeah sure well you want to smell it
773.72 - for a while you got to see how it goes
775.72 - yeah just admire it yeah uh and then it
778.44 - was um um trying to figure out a plan
781.48 - right like $2,000 account there's not a
783.92 - lot you can do you can't do trade of and
787.88 - can't you can't have 30 positions on um
790.60 - and it really teaches you uh kind of a a
794.40 - perspective on where and how to deploy
797.20 - Capital uh which you you talk about a
799.44 - lot um
802.96 - to size a position with the risk you're
805.68 - willing to take on you want a winner
807.88 - obviously but sure again and you're I'm
809.60 - trying to figure out a way to learn how
811.88 - to win not not necessarily always make
813.92 - the money right away that was kind of
816.28 - part of the whole Genesis of tasty was
819.04 - you know before we can really focus on
822.08 - wealth creation we need to focus
825.00 - on teaching people and showing people
827.72 - that you
829.72 - know how how you can actually have
832.04 - probabilities and in finance that are
835.28 - real um that are you know theoretical
838.40 - that are practical
839.92 - but that are not you know not completely
843.00 - just made up like well and you you know
846.20 - certainly more than I most people hear
848.80 - derivatives and it's an instant
850.52 - association with gambling or or highrisk
854.16 - weapons of mass destruction as Warren
855.92 - Buffett once said sure it's a pretty
857.40 - famous quote Yeah uh and it it comes
859.52 - from misunderstanding right they very
861.16 - much can be if if someone's just going
863.48 - in and buying or selling a position that
865.80 - that they're outsized to do but
869.52 - but but that's that is the nature of
872.36 - Leverage and you know and risk and you
875.20 - know if you want an opportunity to have
879.04 - a high probability of success if you
880.88 - want an opportunity to have um to have
884.76 - some you know asymmetrical upside you're
888.40 - going to have to take some risk that's
891.28 - just nature so so I kind of feel like
895.00 - you're one of those weird case studies
898.04 - time I've heard that what not the first
900.00 - time I've heard that your wife tell you
901.80 - that to uh many times okay I've been now
903.80 - that bro um I I feel like you're one of
906.36 - those studies though in that you had
909.72 - lots of different reasons to trade M it
913.20 - wasn't necessarily about like you're not
916.12 - going to open a very small Tasty Bite
918.60 - accounts and think you weren't thinking
921.00 - at the time I'm going to turn this into
923.16 - you know $10 million still don't think
925.48 - that right you're thinking I'm going to
928.08 - teach myself how to win and I'm going to
930.44 - teach myself about a little bit about
933.32 - kind of I'm I'm going to gain some
934.72 - knowhow about financial markets I'm
936.28 - going to learn about some of the in
937.36 - intricacies of trading and strategies
939.60 - and I can use all this in my businesses
942.80 - and my risk-taking my teaching all that
945.12 - kind of stuff yeah cuz the first time I
947.36 - met you had to be right around when you
949.16 - opened tasty works or just just after
952.68 - and um and you were trading mhm and I
956.48 - mean I didn't ask you any questions at
957.80 - the time you know but it's just like
960.04 - um I
961.60 - remember now asking you you know or you
965.36 - telling me that you were using some of
968.28 - the stuff that I can't remember if you
970.80 - asked me a question can I use some of
972.60 - the stuff in class because we have a lot
974.72 - of professors and or that you were using
977.64 - some of the stuff that we were doing in
979.60 - class which I was like that's awesome
981.20 - you know because I want professors to
983.84 - change kind of the curriculum and bring
987.40 - It Forward a few decades decades 30 40
990.56 - years yeah 30 40 years exactly and so I
992.72 - was so happy that you were doing that
994.20 - and and I kind of remember that you know
996.36 - conversation I've had that with a bunch
997.76 - of professors all over and it's cool
999.88 - yeah so let's talk about the progression
1003.24 - so the first couple of years are you
1005.88 - like you know just kind of Treading
1007.80 - Water uh yeah uh I mean first year first
1010.52 - year of a year I think I pretty much
1011.64 - ended flat like maybe maybe $100 down
1014.36 - yeah which you know $2,000 account it's
1016.40 - a it's a dip but um I was just all defin
1019.88 - risk I'm pretty sure in the first year
1021.36 - yeah could couldn't afford anything yeah
1023.96 - you know I think maybe the affordable
1025.36 - undefined position at the time would
1026.68 - have been like Snapchat when it was you
1028.64 - know like a $8 stock or something like
1030.60 - you sell you're selling the $7 put when
1032.72 - $8 yeah yeah it wasn't wasn't the best
1034.64 - decisions but uh you know feeling out
1038.44 - how uh to manage the position right and
1041.76 - that's something that that really uh
1045.32 - takes time to learn that process of how
1048.16 - to properly make
1049.48 - oh yeah because you know anybody can
1051.40 - manage a winner it's the losers that
1054.28 - that where you start to get it's the
1055.72 - challenge yeah um and you know if if
1058.72 - nothing that early the early years uh
1061.88 - teaches you to be humble pretty quickly
1064.00 - uh you don't know anything when the bell
1065.60 - goes off it makes you second second
1068.56 - guess your Genius you know like like
1070.60 - you've been told your whole life you
1072.28 - know you go through your your
1073.52 - undergraduate degree your graduate
1075.00 - degree you're it's humbling pretty quick
1076.64 - hey my kid's a genius and then all of a
1078.24 - sudden you get humble by the Marcus when
1079.68 - you're like I guess I don't really know
1081.40 - anything Market doesn't care what your
1082.92 - position is that's right doesn't care
1084.28 - how smart you are it doesn't care about
1085.44 - your phds it'll go right through yeah
1087.44 - exactly uh and so so just learning to
1089.68 - operate that environment you know it's a
1092.60 - it's a big box that you're you're
1094.00 - playing in hell yeah absolutely so so
1097.20 - you kind of for two or three years
1100.40 - you I don't know you go sideways spin
1102.68 - your wheels you know like learning uh
1104.80 - learning grinding it up couple wins
1106.84 - couple losses um you know trying to
1110.24 - learn from the losses what what went
1111.52 - wrong did I not manage it correctly uh
1113.72 - did the market just go through me which
1115.56 - happens uh yeah was it too big a risk
1118.24 - for for what I put on or did I just have
1120.92 - the wrong position on you know I don't I
1122.84 - don't know that there was a theme there
1123.92 - it was just trying to figure I hope you
1125.04 - teach your students that sometimes the
1126.76 - stocks win yeah oh yeah but you have to
1129.36 - right right um you could have the
1131.12 - absolute best position on and there's
1133.00 - nothing you can do about it like you
1134.64 - should have been right which you weren't
1136.16 - you know probabilities are what they are
1137.68 - and 5% happens 5% of the you could be
1140.32 - playing poker and have two Aces you know
1142.60 - and both lost that hand yes exactly lost
1145.92 - that hand many times right yeah so um
1148.28 - sitting on 20 to blackjack table yeah
1149.92 - exactly sitting on 21 and you push you
1152.40 - know and it's like how com so let's
1154.84 - start getting into a little bit of the
1156.92 - um you know when you started to turn the
1159.16 - corner yeah like did some did a bell go
1161.68 - off did you figure it out no it was
1163.36 - Comfort um you started I started to
1166.84 - understand where and how
1169.36 - uh I was taking on risk and what that
1171.40 - meant um in the position you know you
1174.00 - see the buying power reduction which of
1175.40 - course is is quantification of it but
1177.28 - what does it actually mean how does that
1178.84 - fluctuate you mostly trading um equities
1181.48 - or indexes or what uh yeah no no Futures
1184.84 - uh no Futures options at that time it
1186.80 - was just would have been listed uh
1189.16 - single stocks or or ETFs are you trading
1191.88 - Futures and Futures options now yeah
1193.72 - okay good yeah when you first like now
1196.12 - we're up to like 2020 you've been doing
1197.76 - this for like let's say 3 years um
1200.68 - you're you're still you have a small
1202.76 - account you're just you're you're you're
1205.40 - learning M you've got you now you're
1207.64 - three years in it's like it's like a
1209.16 - graduate degree yeah you know longer um
1213.92 - and uh and you're not being
1217.44 - rewarded you're not being rewarded
1219.52 - monetarily but you're being rewarded
1222.40 - something else yeah I mean I think I'm
1224.08 - up probably a couple hundred bucks maybe
1225.44 - $1 thousand doll I for for the exact
1227.68 - numbers but um yeah I've learned a
1231.00 - process right uh your your analogy there
1233.84 - to a graduate program it feels about
1235.48 - right like you don't remember every
1236.72 - class and every lecture but but you know
1238.24 - you've learned something along the way
1240.12 - and uh things are easier you start to
1242.24 - know what position what strategy you
1243.92 - want to use environment and when you win
1247.64 - when you win it doesn't matter like even
1249.92 - to this day for me whether it's like it
1252.88 - could be a $100,000 win it can be a
1255.20 - $1,000 win it can be a $100 win it's a
1257.32 - win it's a win I don't don't really care
1259.44 - so freaking win and and winning is part
1264.20 - of this game it's like you have to have
1265.84 - wins MH yeah you have to keep
1267.68 - reinforcing absolutely all right so what
1270.04 - happened in 2020 where your your return
1273.28 - in 2020 was 160% so what happened all of
1277.92 - a sudden um that was you know uh the
1281.88 - world changed um but in a financial
1284.04 - Market the right place at the right time
1286.72 - I mean 2020 was the pandemic yeah so you
1289.48 - were home you know I I had three under
1291.36 - the belt so I'll say there weren't
1293.00 - really any first dat Jitters right I
1294.64 - wasn't coming in um so watching uh IV
1299.00 - Spike across the market um I'll say
1302.68 - knowing for whatever that means no one
1304.16 - knows anything but anticipating that as
1307.08 - with every other time in the market
1308.48 - history it's it's overstated being able
1311.32 - to act on that right that's the three
1313.32 - years of of trading practice to go all
1315.92 - right to deploy the tools that you have
1317.88 - in your tool belt
1319.32 - um and and the returns came in uh you
1322.12 - know great on a percentage Bas still
1324.84 - what strategies were you into them like
1327.28 - what were you doing in 2020 uh probably
1330.12 - just wide iron Condors at that point um
1332.96 - again taking advantage of that the just
1335.56 - absolute massive spike in volatility
1337.44 - across the market um not being
1339.92 - comfortable to go undefined in those
1342.48 - okay I was probably trading undefined at
1344.40 - that time yeah but with such high IV
1347.00 - going okay you know I don't know what I
1348.72 - don't know here and this is when you
1350.64 - know the train comes out of out of the
1352.20 - left side and takes it all out so I'll
1355.00 - put the the guard rails back on a little
1356.76 - bit for my own safety I like um but
1358.92 - still you know wide enough that was able
1360.96 - to to reduce some of the friction of of
1363.68 - the downside of definer strategies and
1366.48 - then so we move forward into
1369.32 - 2021 and in 2021 you make half your
1374.20 - return is half as much but it's still
1375.88 - 82% instead of 160 60 is not realistic
1379.56 - not realistic yeah by the next year 82
1382.08 - 882 is not really realistic either but
1384.04 - still you did it we we lived in I I yeah
1387.04 - we did we did and and that's where
1389.08 - throughout that year I started taking
1390.60 - those guardrails off went more undefined
1392.56 - risk okay and so what percentage were
1395.04 - you defined and undefined prior to that
1397.84 - I'd say probably 90% defined okay and
1400.68 - what about 2021 transitioning through
1402.52 - the pandemic I probably came into 50/50
1405.48 - and and now maybe are in the 6040 defin
1409.16 - being the bigger part there got it and
1412.00 - again it's just is that the primary
1413.68 - change or was there something else that
1415.08 - year 2021 uh no that's primary change
1418.04 - and then you know an accommodating
1419.24 - Market um again I can't overstate yeah
1422.16 - the after the whole mem stock thing in
1424.04 - 2021 stayed away from that yeah well
1426.64 - that's good but I mean after that there
1427.88 - was a volatility contraction kind of for
1429.64 - the rest of the year yeah so it's a
1431.76 - pretty good year and then we fast
1434.88 - forward to 2022 mhm but 2022 you lost
1439.52 - money lost money it's good to have a
1441.12 - losing year I think what happened it got
1443.00 - too big um oh the classic well um I got
1447.56 - too big in that I went into the Futures
1450.76 - market and the Futures Market won and
1453.92 - you didn't realize how big those
1455.40 - products were yeah yeah um I stand by it
1459.00 - as an important lesson to have learned
1460.92 - no one likes losing year but what
1462.84 - Futures Market in particular yes oh yes
1465.80 - yeah just uh you know I I honestly think
1468.52 - I sold the I bought back the down tick
1471.40 - uh in a falling Market to help to to you
1473.48 - know cancel the crash and it went up
1475.20 - after I sold oh thank you very much
1476.68 - you're welcome uh emotionally that's
1478.84 - what it feels like for sure U but that's
1481.24 - all do you know how many Traders think
1482.48 - they sold the bottom like everybody
1485.32 - multiple times it's a fishing story
1487.08 - we'll never know s the bottom Bo
1488.40 - somebody has to right of course
1490.04 - everybody does everybody's watched the
1491.36 - same movie but that year you finished
1493.32 - down 42% yeah so you know up 162 up 82
1497.92 - down 42 did that did it shake you or was
1501.96 - it just like hey you know what this
1503.48 - happens um both really uh it it was all
1507.36 - right what happened and you can pinpoint
1509.08 - CU you had to be pretty cocky after
1510.60 - being up 250% the prior two years um I
1514.36 - I'll be honest I wasn't cuz the Market's
1516.56 - humbling right you have enough losers
1518.92 - where even when you think you're right
1520.64 - and and you're wrong how often are you
1522.16 - trading that in by 2022 uh by 2022
1526.32 - probably two three times a week
1528.88 - pretty light you yeah that's not that
1530.60 - much don't have a lot of capital to
1531.76 - trade with at the time um so a lot of
1535.04 - it's watching and going okay do I have
1536.76 - to manage this or no I'm just going to
1539.28 - sit and see see how this uh did you get
1541.28 - it discouraged at all in 2022 oh
1543.76 - absolutely you know anytime you get
1545.96 - discouraged at a losing trade a losing
1547.96 - air uh but you know take take a step
1551.40 - back and analyze where did the loss come
1554.20 - from was it thematically an issue that I
1557.72 - just had all the wrong positions on or
1560.04 - no it turns out it's you know five or 10
1562.28 - positions that are just too big and when
1565.20 - they down draft they downdraft you know
1568.16 - there's nothing else you can do and so
1569.68 - you you re everything you were teaching
1571.48 - at the time come to question you're like
1574.12 - uh probably right there there's that
1576.04 - moment where you go look like I thought
1577.76 - I had this under control again not not
1580.04 - not in a calculate but I thought there's
1582.28 - a strategy I'm trying to follow well
1583.76 - 2022 was also a pretty decent Siz
1586.52 - selloff yeah and March is where most of
1589.20 - the losses came from in in a strange way
1591.68 - given your your age and given when you
1594.44 - kind you had never seen like there
1597.16 - hasn't been a lot of bare barket no 2023
1600.68 - you make a comeback and you're up 25%
1604.48 - for the year mhm and you um it's a
1608.80 - bounceback year MH um anything changed
1611.96 - in 20123 I mean obviously the market
1614.08 - rallied because you seem to be better
1615.48 - when the market rallies um I'm I
1617.60 - generally trade pretty Market neutral uh
1620.16 - I'll inadvertently have some positive
1622.44 - Delta on but we're talking plus 10 yeah
1625.56 - I mean it it it tend to fluctuate around
1627.72 - on pretty neutral yeah and are you um
1630.64 - your ratio of defined to undefined risk
1633.64 - kind of similar uh now I'm probably no
1636.68 - 2023 oh yeah uh pretty similar okay the
1639.52 - difference was stick to what I know
1642.20 - don't don't play in the big markets so
1644.04 - you didn't do anything different in 2023
1645.72 - except you stayed away from some of the
1647.28 - Futures trades that a little bigger I I
1649.16 - got out of my own way in 2023 yeah uh
1652.44 - which is probably the easiest thing to
1654.04 - do yeah say hey I I had a plan that was
1656.36 - working I spent a couple years learning
1658.32 - this do it don't don't try and Dabble
1661.80 - too much now in 2024 where we are right
1664.80 - now you're up 73% for the year mhm which
1668.44 - is great have you done anything
1670.32 - different in
1671.56 - 2024 uh
1673.68 - more uh expansion into uh undefined risk
1678.24 - and more into um the Futures options
1681.36 - Market uh just outside of es primarily
1684.72 - still in just more um staying away from
1688.20 - the big op the actual future itself more
1690.08 - just into the op got it and what what
1691.96 - kind of actual strategies are you using
1694.16 - primarily ratio spreads in the Futures
1695.88 - options and you're doing like one by
1698.04 - twoos 2 by 3es that kind of thing
1699.84 - precisely yeah nothing nothing too huge
1701.64 - nothing too fancy nothing crazy just I
1703.68 - get that buying power keep it in the
1706.16 - that size account yeah, 2,000 000 per
1708.88 - position buying power yeah the ratio
1711.04 - spreads are very Capital efficient to
1712.92 - the Futures more so than equities are
1715.96 - you doing any what kind you what are you
1718.72 - do in the equity markets CH chasing
1721.04 - volatility whatever it is I'm I'm produ
1723.32 - IND different right if it's got I
1724.84 - shouldn't I am product indifferent as
1727.16 - long as it's liquid um sure which I
1730.04 - think is goes on said but I I'll say it
1732.44 - nonetheless yeah no that's great what do
1735.28 - you think a you need to improve on and
1737.16 - what do you do different this year if
1739.68 - anything hm it's a pretty heavy question
1742.40 - uh improve on I'll say is
1745.64 - um reacting just a little quicker on
1748.00 - putting the position on sometimes I'll
1750.12 - I'll you think about it too much I I I
1752.64 - catch up in what's what's the best
1754.28 - strategy I should use here and sometimes
1755.80 - you just need to put one on and yeah you
1758.08 - can put a second one on if you think of
1759.28 - a better strategy but but put the first
1760.84 - position okay um and I you know I've
1763.76 - probably missed a few moves for that
1765.56 - just waiting what I'm thinking I think
1768.36 - so yeah yeah just the hesitation is like
1771.36 - it should be this I hate by the way I
1773.16 - hate when I hesitate cuz it always comes
1775.48 - back to by me always thinking about it
1777.28 - you know yeah yeah I've also had uh you
1780.52 - know improve on a couple uh losers that
1783.92 - I didn't manage because I was waiting
1785.80 - for the market to come back how
1787.16 - aggressively do you manage as
1789.48 - aggressively as I can with the losers
1791.72 - being the ones that I don't and they
1793.12 - come back and hurt how aggressive are
1794.92 - you in closing your trades are you doing
1797.08 - it you know kind of like our mechanic
1799.44 - show ear 21 days yeah um and there's
1802.92 - even times where I I might I try to stay
1806.20 - as close as I can to the mechanics but
1808.84 - uh if I have a winner who's coming
1812.12 - Tesla's a great example coming into
1813.52 - whatever Nows what they had last week
1815.44 - with I had a winning position on it was
1817.52 - nowhere near 50% but I took it off like
1819.60 - it wasn't wasn't worth no the risk of it
1822.20 - do you trade any binary events uh
1824.88 - occasionally but they probably hurt me
1826.88 - more than they help me you hurt me so
1829.32 - I'm just ask it uh you know the uh one
1832.36 - of my biggest losers this year was was
1834.08 - in the bond position uh around binary
1838.08 - events keep it was defined risk yeah
1841.36 - still hurts when you lose a defined risk
1842.96 - trade I like it that's a good way to end
1845.16 - this um Michael thank you this has been
1848.52 - a really great talk and I think that you
1850.80 - know tasty Nation getting to know you
1852.48 - it's just uh it's a bonus for them and
1854.88 - it's a cool story so thanks so much
1856.60 - appreciate it thanks so much time
