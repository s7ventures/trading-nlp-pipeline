2.20 - over the course of the next 45 minutes
5.12 - we are going to completely change the
7.20 - way that you view the markets and get
9.32 - you ready to start trading volatility
12.24 - not necessarily Direction I'm Jim
14.76 - Schultz Finance phg I've been trading
17.20 - for nearly 20 years now and trading
19.76 - volatility specifically through options
22.12 - for almost 10 now naturally let's begin
24.84 - by addressing the elephant in the room
27.08 - if you're bullish and the market goes up
28.88 - things are going to work out pretty well
30.68 - if you're bearish and the market goes
32.08 - down things are going to work out pretty
33.68 - well like you're going to make money so
35.08 - don't get me wrong direction matters and
37.32 - during the times when you're able to
39.28 - actually nail the directional move
41.20 - things work out pretty well and they're
43.56 - pretty easy the problem is no one really
47.72 - knows where the market is going next not
50.08 - me not you not anybody you might have a
53.64 - hunch you might have a feeling that this
56.76 - stock is going this way or this Market
58.72 - is going that way and so by all means
60.72 - you know do that follow those hunches we
62.88 - all do that I do that you should do that
65.04 - but the important thing to do is just
67.12 - put it in its place understand what it
70.32 - really is in the sea of Randomness that
73.92 - is the short-term directional moves in
77.04 - the market what I want to do in this
79.08 - crash course is I want to show you how
81.60 - you can take the emphasis off of
84.00 - something like Direction that's very
86.16 - unpredictable and put it on something
88.24 - like volatility that might just have a
91.40 - little bit of predictability in it and
94.16 - to begin that Journey let's make sure
96.48 - that we're all on the same page when it
99.20 - comes to option profitability when it
101.72 - comes to generating returns and
103.24 - achieving profitability there are
104.68 - essentially three factors involved
106.92 - Direction time and volatility and when
109.56 - most people get into trading they focus
112.52 - exclusively on Direction without paying
115.56 - much attention to time or volatility but
118.24 - given just how random and unpredictable
120.88 - the market is I think that order of
123.96 - operations is backwards trading
127.08 - Direction can certainly come but it
129.04 - should come after time and after
131.84 - volatility with options and even more
134.04 - specifically short options we can shift
136.12 - our emphasis away from needing to be
138.36 - right directionally and instead trade
140.68 - the simple passage of time and the
142.92 - expansions and contractions of
145.20 - volatility two non-directional metrics
147.84 - in the marketplace that can serve as the
150.32 - foundation to your portfolio one of the
153.28 - first things that you're going to notice
154.96 - when you shift your focus away from
157.08 - Direction and onto volatility is you
159.72 - will have just unlocked A Whole New
162.40 - World of analysis that is now available
165.52 - to you one additional thing that you're
167.60 - going to discover when you shift your
169.16 - focus onto volatility when it comes to
171.32 - your analysis is you now have a whole
173.80 - new way to diversifying your portfolio
177.12 - and not only the risk that you're
179.24 - exposed to but also the opportunities
181.68 - that you find when it comes to your
183.52 - existing positions and the new trades
186.52 - that you might be looking at for most
188.84 - traditional investors volatility and
191.88 - huge spikes in volatility are not
194.48 - normally well received because if I'm a
197.04 - traditional investor and I'm invested
199.24 - just passively long in you know spy then
202.28 - I'm just looking to ride the gradual
204.76 - movement higher in that stock or in that
207.28 - index over time when volatility spikes
210.12 - that usually means the market is
212.20 - suffering a significant drop so that's
214.44 - clearly not going to be good for your
217.04 - traditional passively long investor but
219.96 - for you when volatility comes that's
222.56 - simply going to mean more opportunity it
224.80 - could be exactly what you've been
226.48 - waiting for to deploy more Capital into
229.08 - short option strategies and take
230.88 - advantage of the volatility spikes but
233.60 - also from a diversification standpoint
235.80 - there's one other thing to make mention
238.12 - of while market prices and Market
240.32 - volatility have clearly shown to exhibit
243.64 - an inverse relationship a rather
246.16 - reliable inverse relationship over time
248.64 - where when market prices go up Market
250.60 - volatility is typically going down and
252.36 - when market prices go down Market
253.72 - volatility is typically going up this
255.84 - relationship is not one for one and this
258.24 - relationship is also not perfect there
260.64 - will be plenty of times when market
262.72 - prices are up and Market volatility is
264.76 - up or market prices are down and Market
267.28 - volatility is down that's important
269.76 - because it clearly illustrates the
271.80 - simple fact that volatility is its own
275.52 - independent metric in a lot of ways so
278.44 - it's going to give you a way an Avenue
281.56 - to diversify the exposure in your
284.12 - portfolio that you simply cannot get by
286.72 - just shifting assets into you know fixed
288.68 - income or currencies or precious metals
291.76 - so as we get underway in this crash
294.28 - course here is the first major takeaway
297.16 - trade volatility first not Direction
300.88 - doing so is going to shift the
303.16 - foundation of your portfolio away from
306.00 - the randomness and the unpredictability
308.32 - of daytoday Market movements so here we
311.24 - are inside of the tasty trade platform
313.44 - and I just want to offer a brief
315.68 - overview of a few of the things that are
318.28 - relevant when it comes to market-wide
320.40 - volatility so on the leftand side here
322.56 - forward SL VX so this guy right here
325.24 - this is going to be your volatility
327.00 - Futures going out to whatever the front
329.16 - month might B which I believe right now
330.72 - V is going to be November so you have
333.60 - for/ VX is now trading at 2040 the other
337.76 - market-wide volatility metric that is
339.72 - commonly used if I scroll down on this
342.48 - watch list is going to be the vix itself
344.56 - so this is your Market wide volatility
346.52 - this is often times referred to as the
348.64 - fear indicator or the fear gauge in the
351.56 - marketplace right now you have you know
353.16 - vix trading at 1921 so in terms of
356.56 - trying to get some type of idea
358.68 - regarding what is is market-wide
360.48 - volatility doing often times Traders
362.48 - will look at Future volatility so for/
365.12 - VX wherever the Futures Contract might
366.92 - be right now we're trading the vcycle or
369.36 - the vix the vix which is kind of your
371.88 - spot volatility or your current
373.96 - volatility let's say I'm looking at
375.40 - Apple if I go into the quote overview of
379.24 - Apple so I've got Apple loaded up in the
381.08 - ticker box I bring over this right hand
383.36 - side bar that's available inside of
385.48 - tasty trade I click on the overview if
387.40 - you look down at this IV Index this is
390.80 - going to give you just in one number
393.28 - what the implied volatility is for apple
396.24 - the reason why this is important is
398.16 - because for specific stocks it's a bit
400.40 - of a misnomer to say the implied
402.76 - volatility of Apple is X and the reason
405.32 - why is simply because every single stock
408.32 - has a myriad of implied volatilities
410.60 - associated with it because different
412.12 - expirations have different implied
413.88 - volatilities and different strikes
415.60 - within those expirations have different
417.44 - implied volatilities case in point for
419.68 - Apple you see the IV index is 28.6 if I
423.12 - go to the trade page I simply look at
425.44 - the different expiration cycles look at
427.40 - how the implied volatilities differ from
429.60 - one cycle to the next now you can make
431.28 - the case that's not a big difference but
433.20 - that's not really the point the point is
435.12 - there are different numbers associated
437.76 - with different expiration cycles and
439.76 - then if I open up an expiration cycle
442.08 - like let's say open up November right
443.52 - here with 41 days to go and you start
445.64 - looking at the different strikes that
447.24 - are available inside of that expiration
449.52 - you're going to see different implied
451.40 - volatilities if I change this drop- down
453.64 - menu one of these drop downs from
455.00 - extrinsic value to implied volatility
457.16 - you can clearly see that now I have a
459.76 - number of implied volatilities inside
461.68 - the same expiration cycle for the
463.32 - different strikes that are available
465.08 - inside that cycle so again it's a bit of
466.96 - a misnomer to say the implied volatility
468.92 - for apple is X but tasty trade does a
471.20 - nice job of kind of giving us this
473.48 - average implied volatility of taking you
475.32 - know a lot of the relevant metrics that
476.88 - exist for that stock and giving us just
479.00 - one number number so we have some idea
481.28 - of whether or not we're dealing with a
483.04 - high volatility stock or a low
484.72 - volatility stock especially when we're
486.28 - comparing you know Apple versus Proctor
488.52 - and Gamble now the next metric that I
491.04 - wanted to go ahead and at least
492.44 - introduce you to at this point we're
493.92 - going to have a lot more to say about
495.24 - this as the crash course moves on but
497.28 - the IV rank so right up here you see
499.76 - this ivr for apple is 44.9 now later on
503.68 - I'm going to explain you know what that
505.00 - number means I'm going to explain how we
506.88 - use it in you know trading volatility
509.08 - and all of those things but just know
510.72 - right now that when it comes to you know
512.88 - shifting your focus away from Trading
515.48 - Direction and now trading something like
517.64 - volatility where the foundation of your
519.80 - portfolio is going to look a lot
521.72 - different from what it was when you were
523.60 - so focused on you know Direction
525.84 - exclusively looking at metrics like
527.68 - implied volatility looking at metrics
529.52 - like IV rank these are going to be a big
531.56 - part of what you do on a daily basis so
533.92 - I simply wanted to introduce you to
535.88 - these ideas right here and right now
538.04 - what I want to do now is I want to talk
540.28 - more specifically about the nature of
542.92 - volatility how it changes and why that's
546.20 - important for us as active Traders so
549.16 - volatility is fluid and dynamic just
551.96 - like every other metric in the financial
553.68 - Marketplace and this might surprise you
556.20 - but many of the financial models that we
559.08 - use every single day they actually
561.92 - assume constant volatility in the
564.84 - marketplace the reason why that is the
566.92 - case is allowing for changing volatility
569.20 - in Financial modeling a phenomenon more
571.44 - formly referred to as
573.96 - heteroskedasticity really complicates
576.44 - the fine-tuning that's necessary in
578.72 - these models to capture the complexities
582.08 - of the real markets even if they can
584.48 - only do so partly but for us as
587.96 - practitioners as Traders we're not
590.48 - really super concerned with the
592.28 - theoretical obstacles that you know
594.12 - Academia might run into we just want to
596.60 - know hey how can I improve the risk term
599.92 - profile of my portfolio and so that's
602.32 - why something like heteroscedasticity
604.60 - might present a lot of problems to you
606.92 - know Financial Academia for us as
609.48 - Traders it's actually a really really
611.84 - big deal because it gives us a ton of
614.28 - opportunity Cas in point when it comes
616.76 - to market conditions you basically have
619.80 - three different states that the market
621.96 - could fall into from a volatility
624.28 - standpoint you have expansion you have
627.04 - contraction and you have a low and as
630.00 - Julia show in figure 2.2 inside of the
633.12 - Unlucky Investors Guide to option
635.56 - trading volatility expansion occurs 10%
638.76 - of the time volatility contraction
640.64 - occurs 20% of the time and volatility
643.32 - lows occurs 70% of the time as the name
646.64 - implies volatility expansions are when
648.68 - volatility is rising quickly volatility
650.84 - contractions are when volatility is
652.32 - falling quickly and volatility lows are
654.56 - when the volatility is typically stable
657.12 - with a general tendency to slow grind
659.80 - lower over time as the market slowly
662.72 - Rises well it is these different states
665.00 - that we want to take advantage of and in
666.76 - a perfect world it would be simple we
668.60 - would just sell volatility when
670.28 - volatility is Contracting or we're
671.76 - inside of a volatility LW and then buy
673.84 - volatility when volatility is expanding
676.04 - but unfortunately that perfect world is
678.60 - not the world that we live in and that
680.36 - we trade in so we are always up against
683.52 - the randomness and the unpredictability
685.96 - of the market and we can never know with
688.64 - certainty what's going to happen next
691.12 - still we can use these empirical
693.56 - findings to our advantage doing this we
696.64 - find that volatility is usually moving
699.08 - lower either quickly during a
700.68 - contraction or slowly during a low and
703.08 - this accounts for roughly 90% of the
706.00 - days in the market it is only 10% of the
708.68 - time that volatility is significantly
711.44 - expanding it's fairly easy to see that
713.80 - selling volatility would appear to give
715.60 - us a far greater number of opportunities
718.68 - than buying buying volatility this is
720.80 - the case because selling volatility can
722.64 - benefit greatly from volatility
724.44 - contractions or volatility lows whereas
726.92 - buying volatility might only be able to
729.56 - cash in during those far more seldom
732.44 - volatility expansions to be fair we are
735.20 - painting with a fairly wide brush here
737.84 - volatility sellers can certainly make
739.88 - money during volatility expansions and
742.20 - volatility buyers can also make money
744.32 - during volatility contractions p&l is
747.84 - multifactorial however it doesn't change
750.20 - the fact that if you're in a market
752.04 - where volatility wants to go lower where
754.48 - volatility is usually falling man you're
756.96 - going to have a far easier time being on
759.84 - the short side of that volatility trade
761.92 - than you would being on the long side of
764.48 - that volatility trade no one knows
766.44 - what's going to happen next when it
767.68 - comes to Market volatility there might
770.16 - actually be just a wee little bit of
773.00 - predictive power that we can tap into
775.48 - you know if I go into a stock like
776.84 - Amazon let's say go into the trade page
779.16 - and I'm inside of November with 41 days
781.04 - to go I've got my expected move right
783.04 - there in the center of the screen you
784.44 - know if I set up something like a short
786.52 - call spread to be bearish on the stock
788.80 - you know I sell a 195 call I buy a 200
791.56 - call you know this is a very very
793.28 - classic short premium strategy that's
795.40 - defined risk you can see the maximum
797.00 - loss is 335 the maximum profit is 165
800.20 - and all the other trade metrics that are
801.80 - associated with this trade but now let's
803.52 - say I clear this away and I want to do
805.08 - something that's undefined risk and
806.40 - maybe I have a neutral bias on Amazon so
808.72 - I could just just you know I could sell
809.88 - a 170 put just going right outside the
812.16 - expected move there and I could sell a
813.68 - 205 call going right outside the
815.68 - expected move on the upside and now I
817.28 - have a neutral strategy where I'm going
819.00 - to benefit the most from Amazon staying
821.48 - between my strikes if I go over to the
823.12 - curve view here you'll see that a bit
824.68 - more clearly curve you click on the
826.24 - analysis button and you can see the p&l
828.72 - diagram that is just nicely presented
830.84 - here inside of tasty trade kind of shows
833.12 - us where we make money where we lose
834.68 - money where our risk is our break even
836.72 - points and all of those things just kind
838.32 - of painting with a very very broad brush
840.84 - to show you what is available inside
843.04 - Tasty Tray and these are only two short
844.52 - premium strategies there's a whole
845.96 - another hemisphere with long premium and
848.36 - debit strategies and we'll look at those
850.08 - a bit later inside of this course
852.32 - specifically going back to the table
853.96 - view take a look at one of the metrics
855.96 - so you have a couple of drop- down
857.52 - columns where you can select different
859.52 - variables to look at for your trade
861.84 - analysis and you can see I could choose
863.48 - you know Theta gamma and all kinds of
866.04 - other metrics well right here I have
867.72 - Vega selected for a reason Vega is one
870.96 - of the Greeks that is a first derivative
874.12 - of the black Souls model and it shows us
876.80 - how sensitive that strike is going to be
880.48 - to any changes in volatility because
883.16 - it's going to show you how many cents is
885.32 - my option contract going to move by when
888.04 - volatility changes by one point here's
890.52 - the most important part for what we're
892.28 - trying to do here it's not so much the
894.72 - magnitude of the Vega it's actually just
897.28 - the sign of the Vega when when it comes
899.48 - to specifically a strategy like a short
901.84 - call spread right when I have a short
903.24 - call spread and you can see I'm selling
904.76 - the 195 strike so I'm going to be short
907.24 - 24 Vega I'm buying the 200 strike I'm
910.20 - going to be long 22 Vega the net result
913.08 - there is minus 2 Vega so you are going
915.64 - to be short Vega you are going to be
917.60 - short volatility you are going to be
919.36 - able to benefit from any falling
921.52 - volatility let's clear this strategy
923.36 - away and let's look at an altogether
925.12 - different strategy if I were to sell a
927.04 - strangle let's say just using the
928.56 - expected move as my anchor for strike
930.56 - selection if I sell the 170 put and I
933.12 - sell the 205 call let's say just kind of
935.40 - outside the expected move on both sides
937.12 - the most important part here is yes you
939.16 - can look at probabilities you can look
940.48 - at credits you can look at deltas and
942.12 - thetas and the thing that I want to look
943.76 - at right now though is the Vega impact
946.80 - of this strategy remember if you sell an
949.08 - option you're negative Vega if you buy
951.32 - an option you're positive Vega now when
953.40 - we looked at the call spread just a
954.72 - second ago we were selling one option
956.60 - and buying another option as part of the
958.52 - spread so we had to take the difference
960.20 - to figure out what our net Vega exposure
962.56 - was well when you have a strategy like a
964.32 - strangle this is something that can
966.36 - really capitalize on falling volatility
968.72 - because you are selling options on both
970.96 - sides of the market I'm selling a 170 p
973.08 - and an 18 Vega and I'm selling a 205
975.32 - call and a 19 Vega so there's no
977.40 - watering down effect there's no buying
979.68 - back Vega from long options in the
981.44 - strategy like we saw with the call
982.96 - spread my point and my purpose of doing
984.92 - this right now is just to show you the
987.32 - potential of what shifting your focus
990.08 - away from Direction can do for you by
992.28 - looking at things like volatility by
994.00 - looking at things like ivr which we're
995.68 - going to look at a bit later on by
997.00 - looking at things like option Vega to
999.40 - actually capture and measure just how
1001.56 - sensitive your positions are to any
1003.36 - changing volatility that might happen in
1005.00 - the marketplace what you're going to see
1007.32 - next might shock you volatility has been
1010.96 - shown to possess a mean reverting
1014.24 - characteristic and to understand what
1016.80 - that means we could actually take a few
1019.08 - approaches we could take a mathematical
1021.04 - approach we could take an intuitive
1022.88 - approach or we could take an empirical
1024.92 - approach so let's take a look and
1027.04 - discuss each of those three first
1029.96 - mathematically many academics and
1032.04 - researchers over the years have
1033.68 - demonstrated and powerfully so that we
1036.28 - can assume Market volatility is what is
1038.48 - known as a stationary process a process
1041.64 - where any data points that lead the
1043.72 - variable in question away from its mean
1046.52 - are met with additional data points that
1049.08 - fight to bring the variable back to its
1051.44 - mean or in other words what goes up must
1054.60 - eventually come back down and vice versa
1057.00 - second we could take an intuitive
1058.72 - approach to volatility mean reversion
1060.20 - we're given the natural e and flow of
1062.68 - the financial markets Global events and
1064.92 - just the natural uncertainty in the
1066.60 - world it makes a lot of sense that
1068.44 - periods of steadiness and stability low
1070.56 - volatility will be followed by some kind
1073.12 - of shock at some point volatility
1075.12 - expansion in periods of chaos High
1077.80 - volatility will will be followed by calm
1080.52 - volatility contraction that's very
1082.56 - intuitive and it just makes a lot of
1084.24 - sense but third and most relevant for
1086.60 - our purposes here we could take an
1088.92 - empirical approach and simply say
1091.40 - regardless of what the mathematical
1093.04 - Theory might support or our own
1094.64 - intuitive analysis might suggest what
1097.08 - does the actual data say because in the
1099.92 - end that's all that matters right I mean
1101.80 - that's the trump card that's the Arbiter
1103.36 - of Truth the results themselves well not
1106.64 - surprisingly the tasty live research
1108.48 - team has looked at volatility mean
1110.72 - reversion a number of times in a number
1113.32 - of different ways over the years but one
1116.04 - study the team did back in August of
1119.20 - 2022 really highlights and illustrates
1123.04 - the power of volatility mean r verion
1125.48 - especially from the short side of the
1128.08 - option contract so first when looking at
1131.16 - the vix data that were available going
1133.64 - back to 2000 in this study we see that
1137.20 - the probability of an update or down day
1139.72 - in the vix itself on any random day was
1142.76 - skewed slightly in favor of a down day
1145.32 - in the vix 53 to 47 this makes sense
1148.84 - because the probability of an upday or a
1150.68 - down day in the overall Market on any
1152.60 - random day is skewed slightly in favor
1155.00 - of an update 53 to 47 over time the
1157.72 - market has experienced positive drift so
1160.04 - an upward bias to reflect this drift
1163.00 - makes sense and since market prices and
1165.16 - Market volatility are inversely related
1167.68 - it then follows that we would see a
1169.80 - slight downward bias on any random day
1172.96 - in the vix but what happens after we've
1175.80 - had a consecutive streak of down days or
1178.92 - up days in the vix do the probabilities
1182.40 - change yes and in some pretty remarkable
1186.20 - ways after a series of down dayss in the
1188.80 - vix the probabilities of what the next
1190.72 - day will do don't change much they stay
1193.08 - clustered around 50/50 between an upday
1196.36 - and a down day but as the down day
1198.76 - Street continues we can see there is a
1202.04 - slight shift in favor of the next day
1204.64 - being an upd in the vix showing some
1208.00 - volatility expansion so in other words
1210.56 - there does appear to be a tiny bit of
1213.12 - mean reversion after volatility has been
1215.72 - contracting for even just a short time
1218.72 - but the remarkable part comes after a
1221.28 - series of updats in the vix because now
1224.36 - we see something very different here the
1227.04 - probabilities do begin changing in in
1229.36 - some significant ways from the very
1231.48 - first update the probabilities move off
1233.72 - of 50/50 and they begin to Cluster more
1236.40 - closely around 6040 in favor of
1240.20 - volatility Contracting and mean
1242.28 - reverting back to a lower level so when
1245.36 - volatility is low you could certainly
1247.60 - make the case that this is a good
1249.76 - environment for some long volatility
1252.36 - strategies some debit strategies like a
1254.72 - long vertical spread a calendar spread
1257.44 - diagonal spread like that would be a
1259.16 - good strategic way of thinking about how
1262.36 - to take advantage of that environment
1265.24 - and while the stats might largely hang
1267.68 - around 50/50 there might be a tiny
1270.84 - little Advantage as that street
1273.16 - continues in terms of a big volatility
1275.96 - Spike or some kind of volatility Spike
1278.52 - coming your way you could certainly do
1280.84 - that but the real benefit of taking
1283.68 - advantage of volatility mean reversion
1286.32 - is on the other side after
1289.12 - volatility has expanded that's when we
1292.12 - can step in with a short volatility
1294.72 - strategy like a short vertical spread
1297.04 - iron Condor short put short strangle
1299.96 - whatever and take advantage of a market
1303.00 - that is clearly shown a propensity to
1306.64 - want to revert back to a lower level of
1310.08 - volatility which also lines up nicely
1313.36 - with the different volatility conditions
1315.44 - and volatility scenarios that we just
1317.56 - learned about with contra actions and
1319.16 - lulls you know kind of governing 90% of
1322.60 - the market days that we trade in the
1325.56 - overall market so you take these two
1327.68 - things together and you have a really
1330.00 - nice environment for short volatility
1333.16 - trades so the big takeaway here is the
1336.04 - volatility mean reversion that the
1338.08 - market has exhibited can be quite
1340.92 - advantageous especially from the short
1343.80 - side of the option contract okay so now
1345.68 - we have established a New Foundation of
1347.80 - trading volatility
1349.04 - we've taken a look at changing
1350.24 - volatility and we even have some
1351.60 - evidence for volatility mean reversion
1353.88 - what I want to do now is begin to put
1356.28 - all these pieces together in a way
1358.76 - that's going to help us trade and this
1361.28 - is where taking a closer look at implied
1364.12 - volatility and implied volatility rank
1367.12 - come into play yes market-wide
1369.64 - volatility metrics like the vix or the
1371.96 - vix Futures give you a nice context the
1375.16 - broader context of what might be
1377.28 - happening you know RIT l in the overall
1379.68 - Market indexes but when it comes to
1382.16 - specifically selecting a strategy in a
1384.88 - specific stock you want to dial in you
1387.84 - want to really hone in your focus on
1390.32 - what's going on in that specific stock
1392.84 - with its implied volatility and its
1395.64 - implied volatility rank so let's begin
1398.56 - with a closer look at implied volatility
1400.92 - implied volatility essentially measures
1403.20 - how volatile that specific underlying
1405.60 - stock is expected to be over whatever
1408.00 - time period perod you might be
1409.12 - interested in higher implied volatility
1411.08 - means more volatility and wider ranges
1413.32 - are expected in the stock and lower
1415.00 - implied volatility means less volatility
1417.36 - and narrower ranges are expected in the
1419.40 - stock furthermore IV is one of the
1422.28 - inputs into the black Souls option
1424.00 - pricing model that is used to determine
1426.76 - what the options price should be along
1429.08 - with other metrics like the stock price
1431.28 - the strike price time to exploration
1433.28 - interest rates and any potential
1435.76 - dividends the most important thing for
1438.08 - us here is the relationship between the
1441.16 - option price that eventually comes out
1443.04 - of the black Souls model and the IV of
1445.68 - the stock that goes into the black shs
1447.64 - model simply put if IV is higher then
1450.36 - the option price will be higher and if
1452.24 - IV is lower then the option price will
1454.28 - be lower and if you're looking for a
1456.40 - deeper dive into all things option
1458.24 - pricing we actually have a separate
1460.24 - crash course that's already on the
1461.80 - YouTube channel so you can give that guy
1463.72 - a look whenever you're ready but here
1465.60 - the main takeaway is this if you're
1467.20 - buying options with Reit strategies like
1469.32 - we've talked about before then using
1471.12 - these in stocks that have lower IVs can
1473.64 - make some sense but what's even more
1475.60 - effective if you're selling options with
1477.56 - credit strategies like we've talked
1478.96 - about before so short vertical short
1480.64 - strangles short puts Etc then using
1482.96 - these in stocks that have higher IVs can
1485.88 - certainly make some sense this is an
1488.00 - oversimplification and implied
1489.68 - volatility is not the only thing that
1491.76 - you should consider when you're doing
1493.52 - your trade analysis as we're going to
1495.32 - see here in just a couple of minutes but
1497.48 - this is a really really good starting
1499.72 - point for understanding how implied
1502.20 - volatility impacts the option premium
1504.72 - which is going to play a big role in
1507.08 - whatever trade you do so now that we
1509.72 - have a basic understanding of how
1512.20 - implied volatility is going to impact
1513.80 - our trading let's shift our Focus over
1516.36 - to implied volatility rank or ivr while
1521.00 - IV is a metric that gets input into the
1523.92 - black Souls model ivr is a separate
1526.72 - measurement that actually looks at IV
1528.96 - relative to itself over some period of
1532.04 - time let me show you what I mean what
1533.72 - the ivr does is it looks at the range of
1537.44 - implied volatility for that specific
1539.80 - stock over the last 12 months and then
1542.40 - it tells you where the current IV sits
1545.12 - in that range so for example let's say
1547.56 - the range of IVs for Apple over the last
1550.08 - 12 months was a low of a 30 IV and a
1553.52 - high of a 50 IV if the current IV was 40
1557.44 - then that means app's IV is right in the
1559.96 - middle of the IV range over the last 12
1563.20 - months so its ivr would be 50 showing
1566.08 - that it's sitting at the 50th percentile
1569.16 - of that IV range and if Apple's IV was
1572.20 - 35 then it would be five IV points into
1575.96 - the 20 point IV range from 30 to 50
1579.16 - which would be the 25th percentile so an
1581.64 - ivr of 25 similarly let's say you've got
1584.60 - Amazon with an IV range of 25 on the low
1587.08 - end and 65 on the high end following the
1589.80 - same process if Amazon's current IV is
1592.12 - 30 then it's five IV points into a 40
1595.56 - Point IV range which would be an ivr of
1598.28 - 12.5 now there might also be times where
1600.96 - you see ivrs that have moved outside of
1604.28 - the zero to 100 boundaries this is
1607.00 - actually pretty simple to deal with it
1609.12 - simply means that the current implied
1611.00 - volatility is either lower than the
1613.68 - previous 12-month low or higher than the
1616.88 - previous 12-month High more specifically
1619.72 - if you see an ivr of -10 that simply
1622.64 - means the current implied volatility is
1624.88 - 10% lower than the previous year's low
1628.48 - or if you see an ivr of 106 that simply
1631.24 - means that the current implied
1632.36 - volatility is 6% higher than the
1635.20 - previous year's high so our big takeaway
1638.04 - here is just as we observed volatility
1640.80 - mean reversion when looking at the
1643.00 - market-wide metrics like the vix we want
1646.20 - to take that same principle and apply it
1649.08 - on a stock bystock basis but use more
1652.68 - finely tuned metrics that apply to that
1655.44 - specific stock so like their implied
1657.52 - volatility or their implied volatility
1660.08 - rank that allows us to better capture
1663.16 - any opportunities that might exist for
1665.36 - that stock when it comes to volatility
1668.16 - mean reversion and that's exactly what
1670.44 - we're going to do next when we put all
1672.68 - of this together and show you how to use
1675.16 - it to begin trading volatility but the
1678.80 - first question you might have is all
1681.20 - right Jim I'm ready to start trading
1683.00 - volatility but I got to know what
1685.60 - actually constitutes High volatility
1688.68 - which is a great question and it's an
1690.32 - important question and for the answer
1692.76 - we're again going to turn to the tasty
1695.36 - live research team so back in August of
1697.92 - 2023 the research team did a very simple
1700.68 - study showing the difference between
1702.68 - selling 16 Delta strangles on stocks
1705.68 - with an ivr below 30 and stocks with an
1708.36 - ivr above 30 and the key takeaways are
1711.48 - twofold first notice that regardless of
1714.76 - the ivr environment under 30 ivr or over
1718.72 - 30 ivr selling premium was a profitable
1721.60 - strategy but second while the win rates
1724.12 - are essentially the same in both ivr
1726.44 - environments the p&l between the two is
1728.92 - drastically different where your average
1730.92 - daily p&l in the under 30 ivr category
1734.00 - was 25 cents a day but the average daily
1736.68 - p&l in the over 30 ivr category was a15
1741.04 - a day or over 3x what you earned with a
1744.20 - lower ivr now look I can respect the
1747.72 - fact that you may not want to sell
1749.48 - volatility when an ivr is at four or six
1753.04 - or nine because you don't want to get
1754.84 - caught in the Whirlwind that is a huge
1757.12 - volatility expansion that makes sense
1759.52 - but if this is the first time that
1761.36 - you're looking at Short options in
1763.32 - Earnest then I wanted to at least take a
1765.36 - couple of seconds and just point out the
1767.52 - ubiquity nature of their effectiveness
1770.52 - in all market conditions because that
1772.76 - might be rather surprising to you but by
1775.52 - all means when ivrs are low and implied
1778.44 - volatility is suppressed like that might
1780.92 - be the time to mix in your debit
1783.72 - strategies your long verticals your
1785.44 - calendars your diagonals Etc and we'll
1787.64 - take a look at those in just a few
1789.48 - minutes but in terms of trying to figure
1791.92 - out you know where is your reference
1794.04 - point between High volatility and low
1795.64 - volatility using 30 as kind of a marker
1799.80 - in the sand in terms of high ivr and low
1803.40 - ivr that's a pretty good reference point
1806.56 - that's a pretty good starting point for
1809.36 - your analysis but again ivr much like
1812.40 - everything else in the marketplace is
1814.24 - fluid and dynamic and so it should be
1816.60 - just that a starting point for your
1818.56 - analysis right some Traders might prefer
1821.12 - to lower that number to where now
1823.32 - they're looking for you know ivrs of
1825.12 - only 20 or 25 and they're comfortable
1827.68 - selling premium other Traders might feel
1830.24 - a lot more comfortable when the ivrs
1832.08 - have really expanded to 35 or 40 and
1835.60 - that's when they pounce with short
1837.32 - premium strategies there is no right or
1839.48 - wrong answer here there are a number of
1841.08 - ways that you could slice this up but if
1843.12 - you're just getting started and you're
1844.92 - looking for a clear reference point then
1847.12 - use 30 adjust it over time based on your
1851.16 - style your risk tolerance your account
1854.04 - size your experience level all those
1856.64 - different things so let's dive into
1858.76 - tasty trade and let's set up some short
1862.04 - volatility trades together okay so you
1864.92 - are now ready to begin trading
1867.32 - volatility like where do I even begin
1869.64 - tasty trade makes it fairly easy to do
1872.28 - that so you go inside of the hamburger
1874.40 - menu that's right you click on the watch
1875.88 - list now there's all kinds of different
1877.76 - watch lists that you could choose from
1879.24 - the two that I would strongly recommend
1881.20 - you start with you can play around the
1882.56 - other ones start with either the tasty
1884.60 - default or Tom's watch list the great
1887.20 - thing about you know the tasty default
1888.84 - which we'll click on here these are all
1890.56 - going to be stocks that are pre-screened
1893.00 - for liquidity these are all the big
1895.44 - names the big players that everybody in
1897.88 - the market is trading the next thing you
1899.64 - want to look at is you have this IV rank
1902.40 - as one of the dropdowns that you can go
1904.68 - ahead and sort the list by well again if
1907.92 - I'm looking for opportunities to sell
1910.48 - premium I'm going to want to click on
1912.28 - this and sort from high to low so I
1914.20 - clicked on it once now it's sorted from
1915.72 - low to high I click on it again and now
1918.00 - it's sorted from high to low and so now
1920.64 - I'm in a situation where I can very
1922.24 - clearly see this is the IV rank of these
1925.28 - different stocks you can see on the list
1926.76 - we've got IBM we've got chipotle Etc so
1929.72 - there are many many many different names
1931.92 - to choose from so let's say I open up
1934.12 - Starbucks which has an IV rank of almost
1936.36 - 75 and the stock price is $97 I open up
1939.56 - Starbucks click on the trade page I go
1941.56 - into let's say the November cycle with
1943.44 - 41 days to go again they have earnings
1944.92 - on November 7th so this may or may not
1946.60 - be a good trade when it comes to putting
1948.20 - it on right now going into the earnings
1949.84 - date but given the fact that so many
1951.44 - individual stocks have earnings coming
1952.76 - up I'm not going to be able to avoid
1954.04 - that right here and right now because of
1955.48 - the time of the year that we are doing
1957.80 - this video so let's bypass the earnings
1960.40 - impact for the purposes of what we're
1962.00 - trying to accomplish right now if I open
1963.68 - up November you know let's say that I
1965.80 - was bullish on Starbucks well one of the
1968.52 - strategies I could use a very popular
1970.68 - strategy when you're bullish on a stock
1972.96 - is you could sell a put spread so I
1974.88 - could go in here and I could sell the 95
1976.80 - put and I could buy the 90 put and I
1978.84 - will be able to collect a $1.74 credit
1981.32 - 62% pop positive Theta positive Delta of
1984.80 - course because it's a bullish strategy
1986.28 - your p50 is 77% my maximum loss is only
1989.52 - the difference between the width of the
1991.36 - spread and the credit that I collect and
1993.00 - so all the trade metrics are looking
1995.08 - pretty good on this specific strategy
1997.60 - but again what I really want to focus on
1999.88 - here is the volatility impact you know
2002.68 - you have the Vega here where you're
2004.60 - looking at how sensitive is this Strate
2007.96 - y to changing volatility well this is a
2010.16 - spread so I'm selling volatility on one
2012.24 - leg and essentially buying volatility on
2014.48 - the other leg I'm short 13 Vegas here
2017.16 - I'm long 10 Vegas there so my net Vega
2019.92 - exposure is -3 because I'm short 13 and
2023.00 - I'm long 10 so by being short three Vega
2026.36 - I am going to have some negative
2028.28 - volatility exposure remember that when
2030.84 - the market Rises volatility typically
2034.04 - goes down so look at how well you can
2037.16 - strategic Ally play you know the market
2039.64 - or Starbucks in this specific instance
2042.16 - by setting up a short put spread in that
2044.44 - if you are correct and the stock rallies
2046.92 - because you're positive Delta you want
2048.68 - the stock to move higher then you're
2050.24 - probably going to see the implied
2052.08 - volatility of Starbucks go down because
2054.96 - most stocks do follow that relationship
2056.96 - volatility is its own metric some stocks
2058.88 - when the price Rises the volatility Also
2060.84 - Rises and when you know the price goes
2062.32 - down the volatility goes down that does
2063.76 - happen too but most individual stocks
2065.68 - are going to follow suit with the
2067.76 - overall Market where you have the
2069.04 - inverse relationship between volatility
2071.64 - and price and so by choosing something
2073.84 - like a short put spread you're able to
2076.08 - capitalize on any volatility contraction
2078.56 - that might happen in the marketplace
2080.04 - which could also be accompanied by a
2082.16 - market Rising a stock going higher which
2084.44 - is going to be really really good for
2086.08 - your short put spread strategy here but
2088.12 - an altogether different strategy that
2089.92 - you could choose that's very similar in
2091.52 - a lot of ways but different in some
2093.40 - significant ones is you could just you
2095.24 - know clear this away and let's say you
2097.04 - want to go into with an undefined risk
2099.08 - strategy that's going to be able to
2100.56 - better capitalize on any volatility
2102.84 - contractions so maybe you go in and you
2104.68 - just sell a 90 put so now you can see
2107.04 - this is still a bullish strategy similar
2109.36 - to the one we just had it's even more
2110.76 - bullish than the short put spread but
2112.36 - now you have a higher probability of
2113.92 - making 50% which makes sense because
2115.72 - that's the general relationship between
2117.32 - undefined risk and defined risk but now
2119.44 - you have short 10 Vega right there's no
2122.08 - long Vega there's no defined risk so now
2124.68 - you have more exposure to volatility
2126.80 - contraction now of course it's been said
2128.68 - before for every gimme there's a Goa so
2130.60 - you might be wondering R jim I've got
2131.96 - this gimme of more Vega I've got this
2133.36 - gimme of more volatility exposure where
2134.88 - is the gcha well what happens if
2136.20 - Starbucks goes down you're going to get
2137.64 - hurt more than you would with that short
2140.08 - PPR of course it's games and gotas you
2142.16 - know it's pros and cons it's trade-offs
2143.72 - it's always trade-offs you could make
2145.24 - your whole career for your whole
2147.20 - investing life just selling puss from
2149.48 - start to finish I know many traders who
2151.20 - have done that have been really really
2152.48 - successful you've got positive drift
2154.08 - you've got negative Vega you have so
2155.40 - many things that are working for you
2156.72 - that are in your favor so there's a
2159.24 - couple of examples of what you can do
2161.60 - with short volatility trades and of
2163.28 - course there's so many other things that
2165.24 - you can do I mean the permutations and
2167.20 - combinations that are available in the
2169.00 - world of options even just on the short
2171.08 - side alone are almost literally endless
2174.40 - and so use this as a starting point to
2177.16 - uncover additional short premium trades
2180.00 - that you can begin to add to your
2181.64 - portfolio now of course there might be
2183.96 - some times when you want to play a debit
2185.84 - strategy maybe play for a volatility
2187.80 - Spike so let's hop back into tasty trade
2190.20 - now and work through how to set those up
2192.48 - as well there are a million other things
2194.28 - that you could do I've only begun to
2196.16 - scratch the surface but I just kind of
2197.80 - wanted to push you out of the nest with
2199.32 - a couple little examples and a couple of
2201.12 - examples that will probably resonate
2202.88 - with you if you're coming from a stock
2204.48 - world if you're coming from a long-term
2206.24 - investing world where you like playing
2207.92 - the market to the upside well short put
2209.56 - spreads and short puts are going to do
2211.40 - that just like we did on the short
2213.08 - premium side let's set up a couple of
2215.00 - long premium trades that would benefit
2217.08 - from vol ility expanding so let's go
2219.44 - into the watch list here go back to my
2221.80 - watch list I've got tasty default I'm
2223.64 - going to sort my IV rank from low to
2225.88 - high cuz now I'm looking for a low
2227.40 - implied volatility opportunity to you
2229.16 - know put on a debit strategy it's going
2231.04 - to benefit from volatility expanding
2233.16 - well one thing that catches my eye here
2234.92 - is QQ this is the NASDAQ index you know
2237.60 - the IV rank is 27 so it's not super low
2240.48 - it is below 30 from that study but even
2242.68 - even though the study was more focused
2244.00 - on you know short premium and selling
2245.88 - premium strategies still this is is not
2247.76 - a terrible opportunity for buying
2249.64 - premium and there aren't too many low
2251.44 - volatility options right now you've got
2253.12 - the vix at 20 you've got vix Futures at
2255.32 - just over 20 as well so there's just not
2257.20 - a ton of low volatility opportunities in
2259.16 - the marketplace right now so if I go
2260.68 - into QQQ a classic strategy to take
2263.72 - advantage of volatility expansion is an
2266.44 - at the- money put vertical so let's say
2268.60 - you're bearish on the NASDAQ and you
2270.52 - want to position yourself to take
2272.12 - advantage of volatility expansion well
2274.00 - what you could do you've got the stock
2275.48 - at 486 and some change you could step in
2277.88 - here you could buy a 490 put and you
2279.80 - could sell a 480 put so this is an at
2281.92 - the money vertical you see the
2283.20 - probability of profit is right around
2284.68 - 50% that's typically what we want with
2286.56 - an attim money vertical this is usually
2288.48 - a directional shot that you're taking in
2290.36 - the stock but from a volatility
2292.40 - standpoint the nice thing about using a
2295.52 - long put vertical is it does set you up
2298.28 - with positive Vega it's not a ton we
2301.28 - want to make our money on the short
2302.92 - volatility side of the market but you do
2304.76 - have a little something here where
2306.24 - you're buying 66 Vega you're selling 64
2308.88 - Vega you're going to be slightly net
2310.96 - positive Vega so you do have a little
2312.88 - bit of long Vega exposure which is nice
2315.84 - because you're also going to benefit
2317.76 - like if I go to the curve view here you
2319.24 - can see I make money if QQQ goes down
2321.64 - it's a bearish trade that makes perfect
2323.08 - sense if the market prices are going
2325.40 - down Market volatility is often times
2327.28 - going up and so this is a situation
2329.56 - where man I could get paid on the Delta
2331.76 - from the market going down but I also
2333.24 - get paid a little kicker from volatility
2335.44 - expanding because I'm positive Vega so
2337.84 - this is one way to set up a positive
2340.56 - Vega volatility expanding trade using
2343.68 - just an equity index and of course
2345.24 - there's a number of different ways that
2346.52 - you could do this you can t take this
2348.12 - example explore other stocks other
2350.04 - underlyings and things like that but one
2351.92 - of the other strategies that is even
2354.44 - more positive Vega is you could go in
2356.88 - here and you could set up a calendar
2358.32 - spread and so again you've got QQ at 486
2361.24 - 487 maybe you want to say Okay I want to
2363.84 - be neutral on the NASDAQ index I don't
2366.76 - really want a ton of directional
2368.36 - exposure either way at least not right
2370.04 - now but I want to play for some
2371.92 - volatility expansion well again focusing
2374.08 - on this Vega that we see here on this
2376.16 - little column on this drop down a
2377.96 - calendar spread of course is I'm buying
2380.16 - the back month I'm selling the front
2381.84 - month they're overlapping strikes so
2383.96 - here I'm in November with 41 days to go
2386.44 - maybe I sell this 485 put so I'm selling
2389.72 - 66 Vega at the 485 put I minimize
2392.48 - November I open up December and I buy
2395.00 - the same strike the 485 put so the
2397.48 - strategy is going to cost me $4 but look
2400.00 - at the Vega impact that you're going to
2401.64 - have on this strategy you're going to be
2403.52 - long 20 plus vegga so you are going to
2406.52 - have a lot of positive volatility
2409.20 - exposure you can make the case well Jim
2410.72 - if volatility expands you know the
2412.00 - market may go down a lot more it may not
2413.44 - stay around 45 that would be bad for
2414.96 - this strategy and so on and so forth and
2416.76 - I would not necessarily argue with you
2418.40 - so maybe you want to adjust your strikes
2420.04 - maybe you want to move these things a
2421.16 - bit lower my purpose here was just to
2423.44 - again give you a couple of examples of
2425.56 - how to trade volatility from both the
2427.36 - short side and the long side my
2428.88 - overachievers out there y all probably
2431.00 - noticed how I just kind of glossed over
2433.24 - like all right let's say you're bullish
2434.72 - on this stock let's say you're bearish
2436.88 - on that stock let's not talk about how
2438.44 - we arrived at that you know directional
2440.48 - bias let's just assume that it's there
2442.36 - my overachievers are probably thinking
2443.88 - wait a minute wait a minute wait a
2444.84 - minute how did you come to that
2446.80 - conclusion well again when it comes to
2449.04 - day-to-day movements I firmly believe
2451.68 - it's all completely random so you can
2453.76 - use the charts you can use the balance
2455.48 - sheets you can use the whatevers to
2457.36 - determine you your own personal
2459.36 - directional bias in that underlying
2461.28 - stock but if you want you know some
2464.56 - guidance if you want some reference
2467.16 - points for your overall portfolio
2470.08 - directional metrics then I would
2471.92 - encourage you to check out the portfolio
2474.76 - management crash course that's already
2476.88 - on the YouTube channel and if you sit
2479.56 - tight for about 3 seconds it's actually
2481.92 - going to start right now
