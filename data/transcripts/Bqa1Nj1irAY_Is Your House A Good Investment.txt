0.08 - is real estate and particularly your
3.32 - house a great investment for
6.07 - [Music]
10.40 - you so just in case you have that
13.04 - burning question what is the growth in
14.80 - housing prices in the top 10 cities in
17.12 - the US so they pulled this data from
19.68 - Zillow so the question is for a lot of
22.64 - people is your house your the house a
25.84 - person's house is typically their
27.76 - biggest dollar investment okay so they
31.04 - say well I'm buying this house is an
32.72 - investment okay that's fine and I
35.44 - understand it um you can do things in a
37.44 - house that you can't do in an apartment
38.92 - you can paint it any color you want you
40.64 - can have pets you can you can you can
42.92 - have all sorts of stuff in your house
44.72 - that you couldn't have in an apartment
46.80 - and a house real estate can be a stable
51.00 - way to build wealth over time so
53.96 - generally speaking and this is my
56.44 - experience again data point of one year
59.16 - real estate in general goes up about 2%
62.60 - a year okay now that's very zip code
65.20 - specific so you can look at a zip code
67.76 - and you know in Silicon Valley and that
70.68 - might have gone up 30% a the year or you
73.88 - know a hot Market you know in Miami or
77.08 - you know Austin Texas or wherever um you
81.08 - can get very specific pockets of real
84.16 - estate that just jump dramatically
86.64 - higher and even fall as as dramatically
90.36 - um than 2% so 2% though is kind of what
94.36 - I consider a ballpark number and you
97.24 - know I have some real estate Investments
99.00 - and that's kind of what they do so and
102.12 - this is what they found in the the
103.68 - United States over the past year August
105.60 - 20123 August 2024 real estate went up
108.52 - about 3% now I don't know what that
110.68 - means okay is it houses is it land is it
113.56 - whatever but this is what they what they
115.56 - pulled up and what jumped out in
117.68 - particular was some things like New York
119.88 - La in Chicago and Chicago I'm very
121.84 - familiar with I live in Chicago for over
123.48 - 20 years own some property in Chicago I
126.20 - know the Chicago Market fairly well 6%
130.44 - is pretty high um and the reason why I
134.04 - would I would take some of this data
136.72 - with with a little bit of a little bit
139.28 - of uh skepticism is that I know Chicago
143.04 - Illinois has been losing population for
147.36 - years now people have been immigrating
149.24 - out of ill Illinois for other states
152.28 - that is also true for Chicago maybe not
155.16 - as dramatically as the rest of the state
157.76 - but people Chicago has been losing
160.48 - population I think uh the the the the
163.96 - way to think about it is there's just
165.64 - enough birth and and I think the birth
169.16 - rate is high enough to maintain it but
170.96 - people are leaving Chicago so who's
173.68 - coming in and driving up this this these
176.00 - prices up 6% in uh in the city I don't
179.16 - know it might because 20 to 20 20 22 to
182.20 - 23 was weak and this is bouncing back
184.72 - the same is true for New York I know New
186.64 - York was getting pum particularly the
188.72 - commercial uh real estate commercial
190.76 - real estate in Chicago too has been
192.40 - pummeled so are these numbers accurate
194.64 - well they're accurate in as much as
196.24 - Zillow has reported them and Zillow
198.52 - knows the data it's looking at um you
201.72 - know and again it's zip code specific
203.88 - and Chicago is a city of neighborhoods
206.60 - you know this is a dozen different
208.08 - neighborhoods each with its own
209.36 - particular flavor of real estate so some
212.12 - can go up a lot more than others some
214.04 - are more active than others and so this
217.12 - may you know the Chicago number and the
219.00 - same is true with New York and La there
221.28 - may be Pockets that went up a lot more
223.48 - than others and that may be why you're
226.32 - seeing this stuff anyway and you know is
229.60 - this meaningful is this something you
231.00 - should say well my house in Boston went
233.24 - up 7% therefore I made 7% return on my
236.24 - house I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say
238.60 - that like I said it is is zip code and
241.44 - neighborhood specific and house specific
244.40 - and if you're not hitting all those
246.56 - major points the 7% you may be up 1% you
250.80 - don't know you don't know until you
252.48 - actually try and sell your house that's
254.40 - why yes I understand the appeal of
256.40 - owning a house I get it I get it I get
258.28 - it and I have other real estate in you
259.92 - know it's I get it and they're
261.08 - generating rents and that's another
262.68 - Revenue stream for me but trading is way
266.36 - more liquid than real estate trading
267.96 - options is way more liquid than real
269.52 - estate estate you can also Define your
271.68 - risk better than real estate and we're
275.04 - going to talk about a couple defined
276.28 - risk trades here so yes saving up money
279.80 - for a down payment on a house great idea
282.48 - excellent go buy your house but soon
284.96 - after start saving up to fund a trading
287.52 - account get that couple of thousand in
289.44 - your trading account and start trading
291.20 - that is going to teach you more about
293.84 - money and the the market and managing
297.04 - money and finances then your house will
299.92 - okay so because Traders AG in dog years
303.16 - okay one expiration for an option Trader
306.24 - is like you know two years in any other
308.64 - job so that that's my point So the
311.56 - faster you get to start trading the
313.44 - better let's take a look at a couple of
314.76 - trade ideas the guys are looking at so
316.88 - metals have been on a run recently with
318.64 - copper Futures up nearly 3% today this
320.84 - was a couple days ago what happened was
322.76 - China really had some uh big stimulus
325.52 - package they announced who knows whether
327.60 - it's real or not and the IDE
330.40 - China is one of the biggest copper
332.36 - consumers in the world and FCX free Port
335.48 - mcor is one of the biggest copper
337.52 - producers the guys looked at selling a
339.88 - strangle in there let's take a look at
342.00 - FCX
343.96 - FCX as a earning are coming out October
347.12 - 17th and has a nice run up massive rally
351.84 - here um if you wanted to let's take a
355.08 - look at the skew so it's trading right
357.12 - around let's say 52 so here's what the
359.80 - way I look at this if I go
362.60 - down three points Market's closed right
365.16 - now so the data is a little screwy let's
367.16 - look at the 36 day options see if
369.76 - they're a little better yeah they're a
371.32 - little bit better so Stock's trading at
373.12 - about 52 I go down um three points and
377.04 - the options about $130 or so up three
380.60 - points to the 55s it's about $140 so
383.60 - right now there is skew to the upside so
387.40 - the market anticipates um more Alles
390.76 - stronger um performance in FCX if you're
393.96 - willing to take risk through earnings
395.48 - you could consider uh selling a put in
398.16 - here again a $52 stock uh if I sold the
402.12 - 47 puts um you know only requires $551
406.92 - of of of capital Max profit 70% Theta of
411.12 - 248 Max risk if the stock goes to Zer is
414.04 - $4,600 but there's a 90% probability
416.96 - making half its Max profit of $35 before
419.60 - for um before expiration so that's
421.96 - something if you were bullish on FCX I
424.80 - know the guys were leing to strangle but
427.16 - um I'm not sure if uh you want to sell a
429.24 - call going into this the second trade um
432.76 - that they were looking at is a is a Visa
434.88 - iron Condor uh $277 stock so it's more
438.40 - expensive Visa has been a news-driven
440.36 - trade recently with antitrust lawsuits
442.48 - raised by the justice department St
444.04 - between 260 and 290 for the better part
446.40 - of
447.12 - 2024 currently sits in the middle so
449.60 - let's take a look at that and what
450.80 - they're talking about Visa has decent
454.00 - decent liquidity it's sold off pretty
456.48 - sharply of these past couple of days but
458.60 - as the guys were saying it's it's right
460.88 - in the middle of where it's been they
463.76 - were looking at an iron Conor earnings
466.36 - are coming out on o 22 on October 22nd
469.20 - so you have to be willing to take risk
470.96 - through earnings if you're going to look
472.76 - at this trade they are looking at the
475.00 - October U the 20 the 250 260 put spread
479.48 - in the
480.80 - 29535 sell the 260s buy the 250s and so
485.88 - that's what they're doing right now the
489.04 - the put spread after the the market sold
491.56 - off it's a lot closer on the put side I
494.44 - would consider pulling this down just a
497.92 - bit let's go down to these strikes see
500.12 - what we get and then pull this down here
502.28 - 285 295 to adjust the strikes it's still
505.56 - the same idea just incorporating the
507.28 - sell off in the stock again um 54% IV
511.28 - rank means its options are relatively
513.28 - rich and the reason I might consider an
515.76 - iron condor in a stock like Verizon
519.36 - $271 is that naked options have really
522.32 - high margin requirements if I just went
523.84 - in and sold the 240 put in the 2 285
527.88 - call Marg requirement is $2,400
530.40 - $4,000 yikes that that's that's pretty
533.20 - steep so if I go in and turn this into
535.88 - an iron Condor I'm getting about a third
538.60 - of the width of the strikes on this
540.08 - trade getting $3 credit for 10p Point uh
543.04 - iron Condor 10 points between the
544.72 - strikes that gives me about 30% of the
548.12 - strike wi that's a good Target uh buying
551.08 - power effect remember the short strangle
552.64 - at about4 what $4,000 Mar this has 688
556.16 - still a little Rich okay it's a little
558.00 - steep Max profits 312 um max loss is 688
562.88 - 74% probability of earning half that or
565.80 - about $150 before expiration generates
568.76 - about $3 80 of theta not a bad trade if
572.04 - you are willing to trade through
573.64 - earnings that's that's the decision here
