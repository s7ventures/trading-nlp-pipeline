0.20 - avoiding pattern day trading how do you
2.16 - avoid pattern day trading Tony Batista
3.88 - have more than $25,000 in your account
6.00 - or trade futures or Futures options fut
7.80 - Futures options yeah 100% or trade with
10.08 - one day to go or trade one day to go
12.28 - yeah so there are a couple ways to avoid
14.08 - pattern day trading rules if you have
15.40 - less than $25,000 and if you want to
17.80 - trade zero DTS because this is our zero
19.44 - DT piece a you can trade the es options
24.00 - or the mees options they have no pattern
26.00 - day trading rules different regulatory
28.04 - body B um well obviously you get over
33.64 - $25,000 um and uh
38.04 - C there you go one trade with one day to
41.24 - go yep yep so what we're going to do for
44.00 - this study well I'll read this to you
45.64 - and then we'll explain zero DT option
48.08 - markets very popular so far research has
50.84 - found that selling zero DT at Market
52.76 - open was very
55.52 - profitable but this can run a foul of
59.16 - pattern day trading rules because you're
61.08 - only allowed three round turns um and
65.12 - that can in one week and that can run
67.36 - out really quickly MH
69.96 - so do we gain or lose that's SPX options
73.48 - included too yes yes yes so do we gain
76.44 - or lose if we instead sell the one DT
79.60 - like the night
81.36 - before and cover at the next
85.68 - opening so it's not a round trip in the
88.52 - day is what you're avoing sell it like
90.88 - sell tonight yep buy it back tomorrow
92.96 - morning yep winner or
97.56 - loser I don't know I'm goingon to say
101.00 - loser just because of the magnitude of
103.08 - the moves of the opening okay Tony says
105.28 - probably a small Loser yeah um I don't
109.20 - think it's GNA be much of anything win
111.28 - or lose because I've done this a bunch
112.64 - of times and I haven't made or lost very
115.28 - much money let's go next slide
119.96 - so we did a study think the win ratio is
122.08 - going to be real well let me put it to
123.20 - you that way so like I don't think we're
124.60 - gonna do two years a study for two years
127.92 - um we're going to sell options on the
130.04 - close we're going to buy them back the
131.92 - next morning okay and we're going to
135.40 - look at the pnl from these positions and
137.96 - we are going to um we're not going to do
141.84 - it on Friday to Monday okay so just
144.44 - Monday Tuesday Tuesday Wednesday
146.20 - Wednesday Thursday Thursday Friday right
148.40 - that's it no Friday Monday all trades
152.00 - were assumed to exercise at Mid price
153.60 - that means close at Mid price and buying
156.36 - power controlling the long strikes are
158.12 - still needed that's up to you if you
159.96 - want to buy the wings whatever okay
162.52 - let's go to the next
165.36 - slide so here's the here's the the
168.96 - here's what we got this is our evidence
171.00 - today so we're going to do this with 40
174.64 - Delta strangles 30 Delta strangles and
176.56 - 20 Delta
177.72 - strangles sell them the night before for
180.84 - every single day for 2 years buy them
185.04 - back the next morning straddles 68% 40
188.56 - Delta strangles 67% 30 Delta strangles
192.76 - 69% and 20 Delta strangles
196.72 - 71% the win percentage didn't really
199.12 - matter what you
200.24 - did very interesting yeah the net pnl
204.28 - for the overnight trade that did matter
206.80 - the bigger you sold kind of the more
208.88 - money you made so the straddles the 40
211.76 - Delta strangles made about double of
214.64 - what the 30 Delta and the 20 Delta
216.64 - strangles made and you and the amount of
219.52 - risk you took was about that's the sear
221.76 - was about the same all along so the
224.12 - reality of this study says essentially
227.00 - you want to sell something tonight sell
229.52 - a big sell a straddle or a big
232.08 - strangle and that's how you're going to
234.72 - do the best
236.44 - MoneyWise don't sell the cheap stuff
238.68 - yeah because you can you don't need like
240.00 - a bird poop like an elephant that's
242.60 - right makes sense we'll do this tonight
245.96 - Thursday for Friday counts here okay
248.48 - let's go to the next
250.92 - slide so selling zero DT premium is
254.12 - generally successful over the past two
255.60 - years provided the winners were managed
258.36 - aggressively that means on the opening
260.36 - essentially but PDD pattern day trading
263.56 - rules make it almost impossible to place
265.84 - and manage zero DTE trades without
268.16 - incurring additional account
269.96 - restrictions if you have less than
271.96 - 25,000 if you have over 25,000 none of
274.12 - this matters PDD can be skirted by
277.36 - selling the 1dt options on the previous
279.32 - close and then manage them the next
282.08 - morning holding these short positions
284.44 - overnight was net profitable but
286.92 - incurred an occasional large loss when
289.40 - the overnight prices made dramatic moves
292.76 - ironically the rules intended to protect
295.52 - retail in investors may push those um
299.96 - looking to trade zero DT trades into
303.24 - more risk because you got to take
304.36 - overnight risk right it's kind of crazy
307.52 - that's the disingenuous portion of those
310.48 - archaic and idiotic rules hopefully that
312.72 - rule will get changed hopefully that
313.88 - rule will be
314.92 - changed um but stay small and give it a
318.12 - shot if you want good job good job out
320.16 - of you good job by the team we're GNA
321.40 - take better results than I would have
