  "is this the end of BPR breaking losses what does that mean BPR breaking losses let's take a look before 2020 there was never there was never a loss on an early managed 16 Delta strangle in the Spy that exceeded the initial buying power requirement including 2008 H that's pretty interesting the worst case as a percent of initial buying power reduction before 2020 of a trade happened in 2009 with the trade's loss of 21 days to expiration closing at 56% of the initial buying power reduction spy in",
  "56% of the initial buying power reduction spy in 2020 we experienced the first loss that breached the buying power reduction before the 21-day DT Mark that was 1.1 times 110% of the initial buying power that shows you how good how strong that number is for really being able to predict kind of like you know maximum risk okay yep in 2024 markets across all assets have had some big swings and this is trans translated into some sharp losses any single but has this translated sharp losses on any",
  "but has this translated sharp losses on any single trade similar to 2009 or 2020 we're talking about risk right now is buying is the BPR really the Beall end all for what your losses can be that's the real question here let's go to the next slide so we looked at the spies The Q's TLT and gold that's PS NASDAQ bonds and gold we looked at these since the beginning of the year beginning of this year we observed the worst losses I mean we're basically 11 months in we observed the worst losses for",
  "11 months in we observed the worst losses for short 16 Delta strangles we computed the magnitude of each product's Works loss relative to the buying power on this trade just for the last year so this is like looking back at kind of something similar to what we do for you know uh buying power reduction that kind of I'm I'm sorry similar what we do for context of like ivr going back 12 you know 50 52 weeks but let's take a look so go to next Slide John so despite 2024 being a tough year to trade",
  "John so despite 2024 being a tough year to trade for many reasons and you know what to be fair every year is tough yes every year has its hurdles there's no such thing as this was that even it doesn't have hurdles volatility just collapses or it stays too low sure yeah I don't like that line because there's never been an easy year since I've been in this business since 1983 for me you know what the easiest year of my entire career was I don't know 1985 why because I didn't have like for some",
  "know 1985 why because I didn't have like for some reason that entire year I didn't just hit on all cylinders I just hit on all cylinders I don't even think I had a losing week that year in 1985 and I made a crazy amount I was so you peaked at 85 is basically what you're saying I I got it 28 years old and I peaked 40 years ago ago listen most people peak in high school you you know if you got to look at you know one floor the ceiling peed in 85 you peaked in 85 I peak in 87 not too not too long",
  "peaked in 85 I peak in 87 not too not too long after you 87 was a good year too yeah yeah okay I think I peaked an 85 though I could have peaked in 87 one of the two uh that's not bad because you're right I mean most people in high school yeah yeah yeah some people don't even get to peek in high school despite 2024 being a tough year for many reason the BPR of a naked short premium trade seemed to carry sizable buffer beyond the worst losses for each asset tested this year we have seen the",
  "for each asset tested this year we have seen the worst losses between 9 and 24% I would have thought August 5th would have been bigger so$ 16 Del to strangle the worst loss in 2024 as a percent of buying power spy 9% Q's 24% TLT yeah those numbers seem they seem low to me year-to dat performance yeah you know what I would have thought wouldn't you think August 5th would have been bigger than that yeah but I've been wrong before I know I you don't have to say it that way many times but I would",
  "have to say it that way many times but I would have thought August 5th would have been bigger throughout 2024 the implied volatility across all asset classes consistently ranged between 15 and 25% on average as a result the break evens for nearly all short premium positions have been quite broad with it which is a significant factor in presenting extreme losses I will say that we did have in 2024 we had this one crazy move on the morning of August 5th where we exploded to about 45 legit 40 you",
  "5th where we exploded to about 45 legit 40 you know 45ish in implied volatility by the next day we were back down in the in the low 30s you know low 30s but we did have one explosion it was a Friday Monday which completely reversed by Tuesday um which is crazy but which is another reason why it's so difficult even if you buy protection against that kind of move because there's no way you could have got out there's no way you could have got out on when do you lift your hedge again right I mean",
  "on when do you lift your hedge again right I mean that's because because how you going to lift your hedge what if they go down the next day right you don't know sure but it's easy to cherry pick yeah so in 2024 so far the worst loss of a short premium is percent of buying power moderate with the worst Market being the q's which total 24% of the trade's initial buying power when implied that's because we came back into play when implied volatility is high it's rare to see a loss exceed the",
  "is high it's rare to see a loss exceed the buying power since break evens a very wide start I agree but John can you do me a favor can you go back to this slide too I just want to see did they wait till right there okay so this is the reason that August 5th I couldn't figure out why August 5th didn't show up here here's the reason because we observed the worst losses for 45 days managed at 21 days so they didn't have to cover the August 5th the bacle on August 5th 6 7th rightly so because don't",
  "on August 5th 6 7th rightly so because don't don't email me because I I I was like there had to be a way worse loss on August 5th but assuming that you did it just by the sold a 45 days managed a 21 days so that part is a little bit misleading just to put it out there because there was a moment of panic on that you know August second and 5ifth mhm yeah third was Saturday fourth was yeah yeah so third and fourth were the weekend so the 2 and the 5ifth and so there was a moment of panic when the",
  "5ifth and so there was a moment of panic when the numbers were much higher than that but then if you waited till 21 days when you actually make the adjustment there was it was nothing at all okay that's fair"
