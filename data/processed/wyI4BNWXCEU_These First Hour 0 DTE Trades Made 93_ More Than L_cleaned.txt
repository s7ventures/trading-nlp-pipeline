we're calling this segment revisiting rolling zeros um we talked about the zero DTE uh I'm sorry we talked about the the one day um vix today was trading at the lowest level we've ever seen it under six 595 or something and we talked about you know this is not a great day for zeros we also talked about funny thing is we also talked about um rolling zeros in the past and which what that means by the way is if you put a trade on and it's a zero DT trade and you make some money on it and you or and you want to just push it further along or you want to change the strikes or you take a profit you want to you know do something else with it our research in the past has shown that it's it's not you're better off being one and done than you are trying to be a hero and do multiple trades a day you remember this right yep okay so what we're going to do today is we're going to revisit that because we have a lot more data than we had before beautiful let's go to the next slide and we're going to see if the results are the same so for retail Traders looking to take advantage of liquidity in the zero DT markets aggressively managing winners appears to be the key to success but what is the term aggressively managing winners actually mean yeah let's put some context around it right so mostly we've considered closing winning positions but if it's still early in the day rolling the strikes to try for another win sounds like it's an appealing approach let's test the performance of rolling mechanics of our new larger zero DTE data set remember zero DTE trades are about a year and a half old now so now we have have you know 18 months worth of data as opposed to a year and um we're building up one of the biggest data sets on the Zero DTS that anybody has for our crazy tasty think tank so using 20 months of data in the so it's 20 months now I'm sorry I thought it was 18 it's 20 in the zero DTE SPX trades why do we do SPX because it's cash settled easy there's nothing after this and easy industry standard industry standard Cash settle just means that there's when the play is over at expiration wherever it fires if it's in the money it's your strike plus whatever the difference is that's how much money you have in your account now you don't get extra money your KS already there in your account like when you see your p&l moving because p&l is dynamic it's there but there's no stock to next B bing bada boom yep examine the 2030 Delta strangles we working very well lately because we've had no movement sou off and we are at extreme lows on volatility and volatility has been crashing it's 20 and 30 Delta strangles managing a 25% of Max profit losers left alone contrast to the Daily results for traders who based whether to close or roller positions on how many hours remained in the trade so all the trades were assumed to exercise or to be be filled at Mid price and the buy and to and the cost of the BPR controlling the long strikes was neglected so what that means is we didn't buy long strikes against these to reduce the buying power so if you wanted to if you need to do that which most people do subtract 1010 to $15 from the daily p&l for more real realistic results that you're going to find here and sad enough on this study they're leaving all this the losers alone why do you bother me every day they're leaving all the losers alone on this study so we're going to do the 30 Delta strangles first we're going to look at winning days and what you see here is closing on winners you 90% rolling until 10 85% rolling until 11 um 80 78 it's not that bad but the problem is it's the money so the average daily p&l is better when you're just one and done okay you take your Prof 25% boom you're done thank you very much let's go play golf don't try to make more out of this right right when you try to make more you actually make less mhm you're your percentage of winning days goes down that's not even that significant but but the money doesn't justify it I I makeing more money you're working less time you're making more money so this is a crazy stat the line the number the second line but it's consistent with what we found 6 months ago and 8 months ago in other research that we did but now we have 20 months of data so the numbers are even the numbers are better bigger data set better numbers and this is as clear as day you're better off not trying to force it late in the day and taking whatever you can get early on in the day way better off let's go to the next slide so this is the 20 Deltas triangles and because it's further away you can see that the percent of winners is here huge 93% and here the numbers look exactly the same the average daily p&l because you're collecting less money is um $48 instead of $78 but all the other numbers are significantly lower and and your risk is higher that's what the SAR is on the bottom so your probability profit goes down your carar goes up and your um and your average daily p&l goes down this is a no-brainer so the next time when people ask you about the Zero D on the opening take your winner go home go to go to another trade do something else not not in the zeros anything else you want to do clear as day Mr Batista I love it I love it I mean uh no nothing nothing crazy about this study in so you're not looking to complicate things no I'm not trying to make this you're really kind of simplifying it yes let's go to next slide beautiful so over the recent past the best short premium zero GT positions have been the earliest ones because people write to Tony and I almost every single day about zero DT positions we probably get 50 to 100 emails a week about zero DTS and most people are not focused on the first hour or two of the day most people are focused on the last hour like it's the whole cash settlement thing what happens this everybody talks about last ER because if you're doing spy you have the assignment risk right yes SP spy is is I know you can get smaller in there and I love the idea that you can get smaller in there and there are other cash settled products uh that that that are smaller there's just not enough volume in there SPX is really you get smaller in there by buying the wings which we talked about but but in the Spy you have assignment risk in the es options on the zeros you have it it converts to the Future so you have F Futures assignment risk in SPX it sells to cash to deal with any of that stuff that's what people like but but for but it's a big contract and the capital required to trade it is expensive but what most people don't realize is that first hour that's that's you know that's your that's your that's your prime time that's your meal ticket the longer trades the longer Traders I'm sorry the longer Traders were willing to roll winners rather than close them the smaller the proportion of winning days they had this was um this generally knocked down their average p&l and managing zero DT trades in smaller accounts can make it tricky to avoid the pattern day trading restrictions as well so you want to be careful there fortunately for the little guy simply closing Winters and walking away appears to be the best thing to do with a winning zero DT what's your Takeaway on this snof you have to be careful if you're if you have the pattern day trading rules because you don't want to shut your account down and there's nothing we can do about it we are really hoping that's Ira also like if you're under 25,000 in an IRA you're going to have the same what we're really hoping for is that with the new SEC person we can finally make some inroads um with respect to pattern day trading rules we don't know if that's the case we're just hoping
