  "mastering pop when to choose high probability trades pop is probability profit by the way following our recent study on probability of reaching 50% profit before 21dt where we explain that pop probability profit represents the chance of making at least one penny on a trade we received a follow-up question a bunch of follow-up questions from viewers when to choose high probability trades and should we start by trading high probability strategies to address this we conducted another study focusing",
  "address this we conducted another study focusing on high probability option strategy strangles and examined the risk reward tradeoff okay that's cool let's see where we're going with this so we did a study from 2006 to 2024 18 years strangles of 21 days in the all the spy compared the risk reward trade-off at different Deltas sold extremely high probability strangles and compared the success to potential losses that's the key here we discussed the pros and cons of starting out with a high",
  "the pros and cons of starting out with a high probability trade strangles are considered high probability trades whereby the Trader has bet on the market not reaching some Far Away bounds so we choose how far away the bounds are through different Deltas pretty straightforward right now just all the stuff we talk about every day and here's when we start getting into kind of some of the sweet spot now Tony and I are in that kind of when we talk about neutral strangles with we're usually in that",
  "neutral strangles with we're usually in that Delta of about 20 10's a little too cheap 40's too high 30's possible if we like to go directional on one side but for the most part we're kind of stuck in that around that 20 area we're not suggesting we didn't Circle any of these say one's better than the other we just wanted to Circle something to say if you sell a put in a call with 20 Deltas each your theoretical probability is 60 but your actual is 71 when we look at this from a risk reward",
  "is 71 when we look at this from a risk reward side it seems to us that for the money that we make it just seems to be the sweet spot for the risk that we're taking and we like that plus 70% probability of profit so that's increas what kind of really turns us on right yeah increasing the Delta decreases the pop it's always you take more risk you make more money if you take more risk you make more money but you're going to lower your chances of making more money and so what happens when we push",
  "more money and so what happens when we push the Delta to an extreme and increase the pop as much as possible you know so so that go as far as we can out of the money what if we went to to like a five Delta or a two Delta we can get to a 95 92% or a 97% and the PD the median p&l drops down again now none of these not suggesting any of these are any better or any worse but you have to optimize it some you have to pick a sweet spot by decreasing the Delta by a large amount does indeed create a",
  "the Delta by a large amount does indeed create a high probability trade however the p&l reduces by a large amount as well so the question is where's The Sweet Spot like Jim just talked about The Sweet Spot in the Decay curve where's The Sweet Spot in Delta is it two Deltas is it worth taking all that risk for 20 bucks is it worth it for $37 or do you like that $94 better or do you like that $135 better I mean these are all really tough questions none of this is easy so let's go to next slide so",
  "none of this is easy so let's go to next slide so it's important to note that if the market experiences a sudden move in the wrong direction the losses could be great and wipe out the credit you received through the small increments and high probability trades as such high probability trades might be worth it when we're just starting out to learn the mechanics and the platform however one should learn to incorporate lower pop trades into your trading to collect more credit all what we're really",
  "to collect more credit all what we're really saying here is find a spot that works and don't go to either extreme so in other words don't go to a two Delta or five Delta cuz you're going to find that that gets frustrating don't go to a 30 40 or 50 all the time because you're going to find that that gets frustrating the lower Deltas get frustrating because because when you lose you you you know you lose more than you can make when you the higher Deltas get frustrating because your pop so low so",
  "Deltas get frustrating because your pop so low so find The Sweet Spot now what we found over the years is that 16 to 22 16 to 25 is our sweet spot so wrapped around 20 22 18 2022 that's our sweet spot and that's how we've optimized everything in the Decay curve and in The Sweet Spot you can figure it out on your own but but like nothing is mispriced but that's what we've come to that's what we've come to settle after all this time let's go next slide so the takeaways your Pop level will depend",
  "slide so the takeaways your Pop level will depend on your risk tolerance as higher pop trades you usually come with lower credit higher pop may be good when you're just starting out to learn the mechanics it's a great way to learn because if you don't if you're learning through winning it's great and you win way more than you lose however one should learn to accept a slightly lower pop for higher credit one should become more confident because you want to get a bigger return on Capital you know",
  "want to get a bigger return on Capital you know if you're going to achieve some ex some return that you expect over risk-free rates you're going to have to take a little more risk to get there it's all about risk and reward you're 100% correct so not"
