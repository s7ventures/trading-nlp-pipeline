  "Welcome to the Life Cycle of a Trade series. In this video, I will show you how to place a synthetic covered call on Intel. The E-mini S&P 500 futures are up almost 100 points, following PPI and CPI data. Let's dive into the trade.",
  "Today, we can discuss the strategy of an in-the-money short put, which is similar to a covered call. Selling an in-the-money put with a 64 Delta is equivalent to being long stock and short a call. This can be visualized on the risk profile analysis. With a covered call, you have downside risk to zero and limited upside potential.",
  "When selling a 21 strike call, you have capped upside potential and limited risk. This position uses about $385 in buying power in a margin account, providing extra leverage. If you are comfortable with the downside risk, this strategy can be beneficial.",
  "At the table, we sell the 21 strike call at 90, using almost $881 in buying power. The risk profile is similar to a short put, with capped upside potential and equal risk and reward as a covered call.",
  "When selling a put, the short call will have the same extrinsic value as the in-the-money put. This strategy acts like a covered call and allows you to potentially acquire shares of the stock at a reduced basis. Place the order to execute this trade.",
  "synthetic covered call and an in-the-money short put at 243. We have about 90 cents in extrinsic value to capture to the upside. If the put expires out of the money, we can make up to $243. We will manage this position along the way.",
  "We have an Intel in-the-money short put synthetic covered call position. E-minis are up 32. We entered this trade on the 15th near the low of Intel's price.",
  "covered call is the same as being long the stock and short the same strike call. When the stock was trading at about $19, selling the $21 strike in the money put was synthetically long stock and short the $21 strike call. The risk profile, max profit, and max loss are all the same. The benefit in a margin account is added leverage with the in the money short put.",
  "Short put options are margined at around 20% of the notional value. For example, a $21 strike in-the-money put would be margined at approximately $500. In comparison, buying stock is margined at 50% of the notional value. This means that a stock trading at $20 would require about $11,000 in capital to hold. Short puts offer a similar risk profile to covered calls but at a lower upfront cost.",
  "half the upfront cost, benefiting from a quick move with a short put now out of the money. Sold at $243, now trading at $113 due to news or a market rally. Taking profits and freeing up capital by closing the position.",
  "We will route this trade at A13 to free up capital. It was a good trade with a $129 profit on $400 in buying power. Time to close the position and take the profit."
