  "welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video I'm going to show you how to place a synthetic covered call all right so today we're going to take a look at Intel we've got the e- mini S&P 500 futures up almost 100 points here nice little rally after PPI and CPI um we've done a couple synthetic long stock positions cover calls and whatnot um I think today is we could expand on that again",
  "um I think today is we could expand on that again with an in the- money short put an in the money short put is synthetically the same as a cover call so when you sell a put uh that is in the money that Delta the 64 Delta is the same that you would have if you were long stock and short the call and we could see this on the analysis mode when we go and take a look at the risk profile when you do a cover call your long stock so you have uh risk all the way to zero and you have capped upside via",
  "the way to zero and you have capped upside via wherever that call is so this the same risk profile would would exist if you are long the stock and short the 21 strike call now you can see the position uses about $385 in buying power this is um in a margin account so you get extra leverage which is which is great if you're okay with the risk to the downside just to show you what the difference would be so if you are long the stock and then if if we go to the table here we sell the 21 strike call",
  "go to the table here we sell the 21 strike call at 90 you're going to use almost $881 in buying power now when we go look at this risk profile again you can see it's the same exact thing as we had with that short put you have a capped upside potential uh above where the short put was here above where the short call is the same amount of risk to the downside as you would with a cover call has the same amount of risk on the position has the same amount of reward because you're selling the same",
  "amount of reward because you're selling the same amount of EX trans value the short call is is going to have the same amount of extrinsic value as the in the money put and it'll act exactly like a cover call this selling the put allows you uh as well to wheel into the stock so if you want to buy shares of the stock this will be synthetically shares of stock at expiration uh with a nice basis reduction here of about 90 so uh we're going to go ahead and place this order we're going to do a",
  "go ahead and place this order we're going to do a synthetic cover call an in the money short putut we're going to drop it down to 243 [Music] here all right so we got filled at 243 that puts us at about 90 cents or so in extrinsic value that we can capture to the upside if the put expires out of the money we can make up to $243 that's the credit we sold it for if it expires out of the money uh you want to stick around though cuz we're going to manage this along the way all right we've got a",
  "manage this along the way all right we've got a quick one to to manage here our Intel uh in the money short putut synthetic cover call position e- minis are up 32 uh we had a great entry on this Intel position obviously didn't plan that out but it happened very quickly so perfect for us uh we traded this on the 15th uh so it's basically marked the low or near the low of where intel was trading when we were looking at the trade uh it was a a synthetic cover call so um in the money short put is",
  "cover call so um in the money short put is the same as being long the stock and short that same strike call so our position when the stock was trading about 19 selling the 21 strike in the money put was synthetically long stock and short the 21 strike call uh same exact risk profile same exact Max profit Max loss everything is the same uh the benefit in a margin account to this sort of trade is that you you get some added leverage with the in the money short put so short short options and",
  "in the money short put so short short options and options in general are generally margin to about 20% is of whatever the notional value is so the 21 strike uh in the money put would be margined at somewhere around three4 $500 if you buy stock you're margined at 50% of the notional value of that stock so a stock trading at $20 is would use about $11,000 in capital just to belong that stock so we had the same risk profile as a cover call but but at about half The Upfront cost to hold that",
  "but at about half The Upfront cost to hold that position and that's really the biggest benefit to this sort of strategy now we got this very quick move we had this short put it's now out of the money we sold this at $243 uh it's now trading at A113 we had a really nice move on some news or potential takeover you know rally in the market who cares what the news is this position is a nice profit so we're going to take our money and run here and free up that Capital so we're gonna route this at",
  "free up that Capital so we're gonna route this at a13 um not much more to say it was a good trade uh it's time to go on this position so there it is $114 uh $129 profit on about 400 bucks in buying power so really really nice return on Capital there over just a couple of days uh perfect trade Take the Money and Run when it comes to you"
