  "probability of a turnaround for different instruments, specifically 16 Delta SPY strangles, can be determined by analyzing the likelihood of a p&l flip after reaching a certain loss threshold within a 45-day expiration period. Strangles are known for their large p&l swings throughout their duration.",
  "45 days to expiration, a 16 Delta spy strangle measures the probability of a positive turnaround after incurring a loss of x% of the initial credit. The chances of the strangle becoming profitable before 21 DTE depend on the extent of the initial loss.",
  "If you experience a large loss, it may be difficult to recover. However, a small loss may be easier to bounce back from. For example, after a 10% loss, there is a 79% chance of a turnaround. Please note that this does not guarantee profitability as market conditions can change.",
  "P&L sign can flip again within 21 days. If down 10%, there's an 80% chance it will become positive. Selling at $5 means being down 50 cents. Studied six underlyings over 14 years: SPY, QQQ, gold, Amazon, Apple, and Google.",
  "In a study of 16 Delta strangles with 45 days to expiration, we analyzed the probability of a strangle having a P&L less than 50% of the initial credit. A P&L turnaround is possible after incurring a loss. If the P&L is down 50% of the initial credit, it is considered a significant loss.",
  "A small negative P&L of 10-20% of the initial credit in a strangle trade can often be recovered, with a probability of around 70% within 21 days. For example, selling a $4 strangle may result in being down 40-80 cents initially, but has a high chance of returning to profitability.",
  "return to profitability is almost 70%. As the strangle loss increases, the probability of a turnaround decreases. A P&L turnaround becomes unlikely with a probability under 50% if the contract loss exceeds roughly 50% of the initial credit.",
  "The chances of coming back after a big loss are less than 50%. With a 16 Delta strangle 45 days prior to expiration, the probability of a loss larger than 50% in the Spy is 24%.",
  "In the last 14 years, the Spy has had a 50% return, QES 24%, Google 30%, gold 32%, Amazon 34%, and Apple 38%. Selling a 16 Delta strangle has a one-third probability of a loss exceeding 50% in the Spy.",
  "One third of the time in the SPY, it's one quarter of the time strangles with volatile underlines. Strangles with more volatile underlines tend to have greater profit potential but also have more volatile P&L swings, with a higher likelihood of a negative swing larger than 50% initial risk.",
  "a negative P&L swing larger than 50% of the initial credit. The probability of a turnaround after such a loss is around 50% for SPY and around 47% for Apple and Google. It's not impossible for these trades to turn around, with a success rate of around 40%.",
  "If you sell something for $4 and it goes to $6, it will turn around four out of six times. If you do nothing, it will turn around four out of 10 times. It would be interesting to see the impact of reducing your Delta by 50%. It may be volatility related as well.",
  "A 16 Delta strangle with a small negative p&l has a high chance, almost 70%, of turning around. However, if the loss exceeds 50% of the initial credit, the recovery chances drop to below 50%. This strategy is more effective on more volatile underlyings.",
  "Trading 50 strangles on volatile underlyings can offer higher profit potential but come with greater risk. It is important to set conservative loss tolerances and focus on adjusting Delta tolerances for more effective risk management."
