  "the probability of a turnaround for different instruments I think you're going to like this one I don't think the results are going to surprise you Mr Batista but I think you're going to like this strangles are prone to very large p&l swings throughout their duration but How likely is it for a strangle p&l to flip after incurring a certain amount of loss so let's just determine the probability of a turnaround after reaching a loss threshold for 45 days to expiration 16 Delta spy strangles the",
  "45 days to expiration 16 Delta spy strangles the probability of a turnaround is defined as the probability that a strangle p&l become positive prior to 21 DTE after incurring a loss of x% of the initial credit so you get the premise here right yes you put a strangle on you're down something go goes bad what are the chances that it comes back got it I don't know the answer I'm goingon to say I mean it's hard to I they'll quantify what percent it depends on the amount of the loss obviously if you",
  "on the amount of the loss obviously if you have a huge loss you're probably not going to come back if you have a small loss you probably are going to come back that's what I'm guessing but let's take a look first a note an example of what we mean by a loss what we mean after a loss of 10% of the initial credit the probability of a turnaround is roughly 79% this does not mean these trades will necessarily be profitable 79% of the time because the p&l sign make flip again you know before after 21",
  "p&l sign make flip again you know before after 21 dtes but if you're only down 10% it's about 80% chance going to come back and at some point be positive that's good to know let's go and 10% just means if you sell something at $5 you're down 50 sense right that's it sure it's not that big right let's go let's go next slide so we looked at a bunch of different stocks we looked at six different underlyings spies Q's gold Amazon Apple and Google 14 years worth of research this is a massive study",
  "years worth of research this is a massive study 16 Delta strangles 45 days to expiration looked at prior to 21 DTE for each instrument we we determined the probability that a strangle has a p&l less than 50% initial credit has a p&l turnaround after incurring the loss let's go to the next slide when I say less than I meant a p&l of down 50% of the initial credit so if you sold something for five bucks you're down 250 okay that's that's more of a real loss when a strangle has a small negative",
  "a real loss when a strangle has a small negative p&l between 10 and 20% initial credit the probability of flipping and becoming positive prior to the 21 days is very high upwards of 69% let's call it 70% so it is very reasonable that if you sell something for let's just say you sell something for $4 just as an examp example because that's probably more closer to an average sale $4 you sell a $4 strangle your chances of being down 40 to 80 cents and then coming back to profitability is almost",
  "and then coming back to profitability is almost 70% so chill lacks let's go next slide sure yeah it's fine let's go next slide as the strangle loss becomes larger the probability of a turnaround decreases I think that makes sense to everybody a p&l turnaround becomes unlikely with a probability under 50% if the contract loss exceeds roughly 50% of the initial credit so this now gets all of a sudden very interesting so you start out with a small loss the chance of coming back are very good you",
  "loss the chance of coming back are very good you get a big loss you sell something for $4 you're down $2 so now it's trading for $6 right the chances of coming back is less than 50% no no bueno yeah well you gotta do something still Yeah well yeah of course but just pointing it out your Chan of coming back are less than 50% let's go to next slide so with the 16 Delta strangle 45 days tax prior to 21 days the probability of having a loss larger than 50% in the Spy it's 24% the qes it's 30 Google",
  "50% in the Spy it's 24% the qes it's 30 Google 32 gold 34 Amazon 34 and apple 38 that's just the last 14 years worth of research so that gives you some context on top of yesterday's context which we talked about dollars at risk which is super interesting today um this gives you some context about hey if I sold a 16 Delta strangle you know what is the probability of having a loss bigger than 50% of whatever I sold and the answer is it's wrapped around a third one third of the time in the Spight",
  "a third one third of the time in the Spight it's one quarter of the time strangles with volatile underlines go ahead what so that doesn't change anything in my thinking like you know no I'm not I'm not I don't think it will right quantify with my risk is going to be yeah you know strangles with more volatile underlines tend to have greater profit potential but they also tend to have more volatile strangle pnls and they're more likely to have a negative p&l um swing larger than 50% initial",
  "a negative p&l um swing larger than 50% initial credit so the Spy is about 25% and the other ones are about let's call it a third okay let's go to the next slide so in this one here we looked at the probability of a turnaround after a loss larger than 50% and in the spa you get about a 50% chance of a turnaround cuse and Google 47 the other ones all in the 40s so it's not impossible at all you're going to get four out of 10 times these things are going to turn around so you sell something for",
  "going to turn around so you sell something for $4 it goes to $6 four out of six times it's gonna four out of 10 times it's going to turn around and that's if you do nothing right this is if you do nothing this is if you do absolutely nothing it'd be interesting to see what it would be like if you you know you roll down and you reduce your Delta by 50% what it would be I have to imagine um that it Vol well I guess it'll be volatility related too it would be nice to see maybe we can have a",
  "too it would be nice to see maybe we can have a piggyback on this one maybe the research team could do something with that too yeah so I yeah I thought those numbers were good really interesting you know it's less than sorry less than 50% so takeaways a 16 Delta strangle with a small negative p&l has a high chance almost 70% in the case of the Spy of turning around however if the loss exceeds 50% of the initial credit the recovery chances Dro to below 50 strangles on more volatile underlyings",
  "below 50 strangles on more volatile underlyings offer greater profit potential but are prone to higher less recoverable negative penal swings warranting conservative loss tolerances I don't think you can adjust your loss tolerance as easy as you can adjust your as easy as you can be more aggressive with your adjustments yeah your Delta tolerance that's where you should be looking at right yeah y exactly agree"
