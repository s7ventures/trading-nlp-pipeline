  "when you do zero days um we recently had a rising star on that was doing a lot of zero day trades and then he did a bunch of like weekly options and some monthly options against the zero days and a lot of people wrote into us like hundreds of thousands of people watched the videos and they wrote into to us about um uh you know different different mechanics that he was using and we decided to do a little piece of research because we got so many emails on the wings so it's it's $120,000 Vic to",
  "emails on the wings so it's it's $120,000 Vic to sell a one lot triangle in the SPX on a zero day okay just so give you some context 120 grand for a one day Zero DTE that you're holding for trying to make you know a few dollars so it's not really a um it's not really efficient use of capital so so people buy wings and by buying Wings you take the $120,000 down to a couple thousand bucks right so buying the wings makes sense it reduces your um it's just Capital efficient there's nothing else to",
  "just Capital efficient there's nothing else to it it's not a risk thing it's a capital efficiency thing so we've looked at a bunch of different things like how far out should would buy the wings um and should we do the wings in the zero day where they're just going to where they're going to rip or should we do the wings longer dated seven days should we do the wings 30 days out should we do the wings at what particular strike you know just to just to how how wide should they be just to be the",
  "to how how wide should they be just to be the most um mechanical and optimize the wings as best we can so that's what this segment is today long dated wings for zero DTS how far out should we go to lose the less the least amount of theta and to give ourselves kind of to optimize the trade so so it's not the most Capital efficient way but it's very Capital efficient and yet it optimizes our our premium risk so undefined risk trades have higher probabilities of profit and upside potential and",
  "probabilities of profit and upside potential and similar toine RIS strategies so placing these trades in zero DTS however is Impractical because of the regulatory buying power requirement minimums for the spot price and the strikes but neglect time until expiration because of this we've been exploring using very cheap zero DT options to turn our zero DT strategies into wide iron Condors but instead of purchasing the wings that are likely to lose all their value in the zeros what if we use",
  "lose all their value in the zeros what if we use longer dated options to form what we call short-term diagonal or effectively Vic we used to call this like a strangle swap same thing right we're we're selling a front month strangle we're buying a back month strangle to Define our risk but really for Capital efficiency selling a front month strangle buying a back month strangle you can call it you can call the um Double D call whatever you want it doesn't matter it's a strangle swap let's go to",
  "doesn't matter it's a strangle swap let's go to next slide it's all done for Capital efficiency so we did a 2-year study using the zero DT SPX options at the market open we sold 20 30 and 40 Delta strangles and we paired them with the 30 DTE so going out one month and instead of going to the expected move like we've done in the past which showed to be very effective we went to 510 and 15 Delta options rather than the expected move We examined either closing the strangles if they reached 25% of",
  "closing the strangles if they reached 25% of Max profit or simply leaving them on to expiration the wings were sold back just before the close so we closed everything out there's no holding the wings here a lot of people like to hold the wings just because you know they then they could put the trade on tomorrow they don't have to get in and out we computed The Net Daily performance including the wings in the guts and the resulting buying Powers noting that the averages of the wings um",
  "Powers noting that the averages of the wings um occasionally but but they were sold for you know less than cost all the trades were assumed to be done at Mid price um let's go to the next slide and we'll see some of the results so this is our preferred strangle Vic this is the 20 Delta short strikes this is kind of where we live and if you go the key thing here is if you go your p&l per day with a 25% profit Target including all the losses that you carry forward and everything else what's nice",
  "you carry forward and everything else what's nice about this is that you make money using the 15 the 10 and the five Delta long strikes but without management meaning you don't take your profits 25% you lose money no matter what you do the average daily p&l is still a positive number and the average Wing cost per day we're just putting it up there about 40 bucks a day so why is this relevant um it is because it shows you how important it is to manage your trades early it's all about managing",
  "manage your trades early it's all about managing your trades early that's all it is you know 90% of the time your trades work if you do this it's all about managing trades early let's go to next slide so if you go to the 30 Delta you make more money because you take more risk you're you're you would argue here that your p&l per day losses without management isn't that much worse and you make over double the money so this becomes attractive your wing cost is the same so this actually becomes not",
  "cost is the same so this actually becomes not bad at 30 Deltas so cons absolutely consideration and if you go to the next slide Beth it's a 40 Delta and if you go to the 40 Deltas here you make even more money and your loss per day isn't that bad either so the argument here is it doesn't matter so much if you do the 20 Delta Which is less risk the 30 Delta which is kind of in the middle and the 40 Delta which is a little bit more risk but the reality of all these you get paid for taking the",
  "reality of all these you get paid for taking the additional risk your average daily p&l is a positive number your wing cost stays the same no matter what and you can pick your poison but the whole key here is managing a 25% that is your entire key that is you know that's the whole game anything jump off the screen at you no no I mean I guess the you I have a I have a the question would be more on like data availability so it's a two-year study and over the last two years every every 10 it's a",
  "and over the last two years every every 10 it's a twoyear study using data every 10 minutes zeros and in the last two years VA has been relatively constrained yep um so that's the only it's not even a caveat just something to just to note that it informs the last the the study it has definitely had an impact um on this study no question about it um the last two years have been um very good for zero DTS if you go to the next slide we'll T tie some of it together so in the takeaways selling zero",
  "of it together so in the takeaways selling zero DT premium is just what Vic said especially close to at the money has been very profitable over the recent years um if you've taken profits aggressively and that's because the market hasn't had a lot of huge moves selling the naked Zer DT premium is prohibited for regulatory reasons however um if you don't buy the wings or you don't diagonalize it the longer dated wings were significantly more expensive than using the zero wings but much of that",
  "than using the zero wings but much of that expense was recouped when the position was sold out it only cost you $40 a day the zeros are much more expensive than that in total um in total the costs were similar but the bprs were higher uh for the diagonals than than iron condors and what did they write here even if um even if it's so much lower than selling the naked triangles yeah I mean of course naked strangles are kind of out of the question um after exploring a variety of ways um to control",
  "after exploring a variety of ways um to control the binding power for zero DT strangles or zero DT strategies in general um using very cheap zero DT options seems to be the most costeffective way of doing it which is a market measure we did in the past but if you wanted to buy the 7 days or 30 days it's a little bit more expensive it might give you a little bit more peace of mind but you can do that as well it doesn't it doesn't change your probability of profit at all let me ask you a question",
  "of profit at all let me ask you a question then knowing seeing that the the 40 Delta is most profitable with the management would you knowing that you're preferred is the 20 Delta short strike would you change your trading to go to 40 Delta or would you personally stay with the 20 Delta with the 25% uh management I I I you know it's really funny because we Tony and I tend to use the 25 Delta right between the 20 and 30 it's usually what's ever closest so like it's easy to sit here and go we'll",
  "so like it's easy to sit here and go we'll use the 20 or the 30 but you have to kind of see what the premium is when you get there and if you looked at it today You' probably go well the 30's got the most juice relative the 20 is too cheap so it it really just depends um we're usually around the TW when we do it early in the morning we're around the 25 if we do it the night before we're at the 20 if we do it a little bit later in the day we're at the 30 so it really just depends we don't do 40s",
  "the 30 so it really just depends we don't do 40s in general but fig we're we're a little behind here so I'm gonna we've been playing catchup all day um we're going to take a short break Victor sitting in for the bat and Tom sof he's Victor Jones and tomorrow you'll have Liz and Jenny it's been a packed week and Tony will be back on Monday Scott's up next Vic we'll take a short break cool"
