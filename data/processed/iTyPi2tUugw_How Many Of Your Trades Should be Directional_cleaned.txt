I have recently become a bit more directional in my trades I know you don't usually talk about it but would you say that 75% of your trades are directional or is that too much you know what I would say 100% of my trades have a directional bias to them not necessarily bearish or bullish neutral is a directional bias too I wouldn't say that 75% of my trades are directional maybe it was yesterday but I would say that over 50% are directional and the other 50% are pigheaded 100%
