  "we're calling this open to 90 minutes minding your zero GTE so we like to do things early and bat this is early this is the first 90 minutes of the day let's see what we got so zero DT markets in liquid underlyings are some of the fastest and most exciting arenas for retail option Traders while longer dated options can profit even under more languid approach big word there experienced Traders know that careful attention and Rapid management are keys to success in the zeros how telling is the",
  "keys to success in the zeros how telling is the initial performance of a zero DTE trade and what can we do based on checking in at the 90minut Mark you think you're bet since we've shown that after 12:00 trades usually go arai I'm going to say the first 90 minutes are telling I don't know it's a pure guess let's take a look so we're going to use 18 months worth of data we've stepped up our game and we're going to use zero DT strangles at the market open and we're going to do them 10 20 and $30",
  "open and we're going to do them 10 20 and $30 out of the money we checked the position after 90 minutes and separated the results between those were up and those were down investigated closing or leaving the positions alone at this point as well as the performance of a fresh reentered position 90 minutes into the trading day well I can tell you right now that reentering after 90 minutes is going to perform way better than leaving them alone but my gut says that closing after 90 minutes is the",
  "my gut says that closing after 90 minutes is the best thing cuz that's been my experience close after 90 minutes and get out of D managing winners is really managing Winners close out at 90 minutes and get out of Dodge you have a 90 85 90% win rate close after 90 minutes get out of Dodge if you have to stay in reenter but if you staying in and you don't reenter you're dead that's my that's just my gut based on what I've learned so far caveat naked's short options are extremely buying power",
  "naked's short options are extremely buying power inefficient so almost all accounts should purchase far to the money wings that just reduces your buying power climate which will reduce your daily p&l by 5 to by 5 to 15 cents depending on how much buying power you're willing to commit the Assumption here is that we didn't buy the wings but we assume that if you do you're going to do when we trade them we buy the wings typically or do some sort of you're going to do about 10 to 15 cents worse",
  "of you're going to do about 10 to 15 cents worse than our numbers if you buy the wings from month back month yep so our reigning zero DT mechanics call for closing positions at 25% of Max profit sometimes this happens in the first 90 minutes so we decided to look at where the three triangles we talked about $30 out of the money $20 out of the money and $10 on both sides and then we looked at the average p&l at 25% which is kind of you know we do win percentage at 90 minutes which is what's new",
  "win percentage at 90 minutes which is what's new to this the average p&l at 90 minutes and the wind percentage at the close and the average p&l at the close Okay so so this is this is interesting for starters the average p&l at 25% let's say we do 20 Delta strengths that's usually we do the 20s so the 20 Delta strangles the win percentage of 94% that's pretty damn good and and and the p&l 251 that's huge that's at 90 minutes the average p&l at 90 minutes then is 263 so the average P 25% it's",
  "90 minutes then is 263 so the average P 25% it's 251 and at 90 minutes it's 263 that's about the same the average win percentage in this case is about 94% okay that's pretty damn good if we held these things to the close it drops down to 71% and the average pen is negative that's why we don't do that okay that's why we don't do it at all the two of the three pnls there are negative if you hold to the close without recentry let's go to next slide we looked at overall winners at 90 minutes and",
  "we looked at overall winners at 90 minutes and then losers at 90 minutes okay closing basically and then let's go that's naked zero day trade we did had a had a pop of closer to 80% so i' would say it was even below the 20 Delta that they have there if I had to make a guess okay so this is $30 out of the money and the win percentage at 90 minutes really high okay the average p&l at 90 minutes really high the win percentage at close and the average pel close not bad the win percentage at close",
  "pel close not bad the win percentage at close for reentering was 79% and the win percentage the average p&l at close for reentering was a negative number that really surprises me that that did not work out that's for winners for losers on the other hand when you did the 90-minute losers and you reentered then that turned out to be a winner so when you had a winner and you turned out to be a loser when you had a loser and you recentered it turned out to be a winner that's really interesting yep",
  "out to be a winner that's really interesting yep when you had a winner in your recenter it turned out to be a loser when you had a loser in your RECenter turned out to be a winner wild overall win percentage 68% I guess that's okay the average pen at 90 minutes is negative if you just combine everything and yeah I don't think that the overall just doing it any time made that much sense let's go to next slide oh they're just going to go down the line here so the the the 20 Deltas the numbers are",
  "here so the the the 20 Deltas the numbers are going to be basically the same you do 20 Delta out of the money strangles if you do 10 let's go to T next I bet it's going to be the same yeah it's going to be just a little bit worse because they're they're too close to at the money they're all turned out to be loers so you got to be a little bit away from the at the money strike little bit away from the at the money strike it's just that the losers are too big here let's go to the next slide so I",
  "are too big here let's go to the next slide so I I think I can already tell you what the takeaway is going to be the first hour and a half can be quite telling for short premium positions when a trade reaches 25% of Max profit quickly you can close it immediately wait a few minutes but don't let it ride to the end of the day it was also a profitable strategy to close winners at 90 minutes even if they were less than 25% of Max profit while it remains to be seen what sort of manag will be most",
  "to be seen what sort of manag will be most beneficial reentering POS losing positions after 90 minutes appears to be promising even though holding through expiration was successful we haven't had a lot of back and forth action I know this is over you say 18 months right I mean even over that time frame we haven't had a lot of back and forth so reentering if we continue in the same type of Market that we've had certainly looks like in today reentering would have worked on this trade too yeah so",
  "would have worked on this trade too yeah so the bottom line here is that if you reentered losers it really worked out if you reentered winners it was far less effective far less you're better off taking your profits and walking away wait and actually you're always better off just taking your profits and walking away awesome let's take a quick 90c break we'll come back with ojoy your friend in mine Mr Scott Sheron tasty trade World Headquarters we'll be back in 90 seconds"
