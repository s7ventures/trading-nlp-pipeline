  "is it normal quick question is it normal for the SPX to be cheaper than its corresponding Futures what is the SPX right now SPX is about uh trading Clos at 70 5751 so it's about $50 lower than where &ps are right now it's about $50 lower SPX okay so is it normal for the SPX to be cheaper than it's Futures what do you think normal normal like Abby normal they're the exact same thing right yes so the reality here is that it's going to depend on interest rates it's more normal in the past than it",
  "rates it's more normal in the past than it has been recently so it's really just a function of cost to carry that is correct okay the cost to carry of the synthetic equivalent of the stock position that you would have I agree it is just it is just about cost to carry let's go next let's go to the first slide it's a little heavy here but we thought this might help people because they're the exact same product the S&P 500 and the spies and the and the es but why are they different in price well",
  "the es but why are they different in price well the S&P 500 is the most popular index watched by investors all around the world there are multiple underlying instruments that track it closely including the SPX the spy and the es Futures the SPX and the es Futures are priced very similar the fundamental difference is that SPX is a cash index and cannot be traded whereas the es represents the Futures Contract which is tradable okay next slide not sure what little s smps up on the day NASDAQ",
  "not sure what little s smps up on the day NASDAQ actually up on the day NASDAQ down on the day by two oh it was just up as of October 8 basically unchanged on the overall Mark yeah as of October 8th es is trading at a premium to SPX roughly 47 points higher this raises the question is the es always priced higher than SPX or is this an outlier event so why not an outlier event let's let's throw that it's not an outlier okay so why does this discrepancy exist if they both track the same basket of",
  "exist if they both track the same basket of stocks and let's take a look like we said it's going to be all about cost to carry next slide please John the difference represents the cost to carry priced into the Futures and dividends which includes dividends on the S&P 500 stocks and the interest rate cost to finance the portfolio for the duration of the Futures Contract the reason we're doing this segment is just to point out to you that there is in the SP there the the dividends in the SPX the",
  "in the SP there the the dividends in the SPX the Dividends are no dividend SPX so let's yeah they're they're already built in but the but the equivalent stock position the cost to carry the equivalent stock position is not in the es uh's buying some at 121 again back to 121 in the es the the cost to carry and the interest the the the cost to carry and the Dividends are built into to the price of the actual future in the Spy the cost to carry the stock and the Dividends are neither of those are",
  "stock and the Dividends are neither of those are built in let's go next slide so because the es trades close to the expected forward value at settlement date the formula is as follows that's the S formula and um we we laid the whole thing out the risk free rate the dividend yield and the time to maturity let's go next next slide think about it if it wasn't factored in there would be an ARB there this is why there is no ARB there that formula right there is why there is no ARB in this play",
  "right there is why there is no ARB in this play whether es trades at a discount or premium to SPX depends on the relationship between interest rates and the dividend yield just think about it this way if the interest rate exceeds the dividend yield the es will likely trade at a premium on the other side if the dividend yield is higher than the interest rate then es will trade at a discount and right now the interest rate exceeds the dividend yield so the es trades at a premium for the last",
  "yield so the es trades at a premium for the last couple of years the dividend yield which is like I think it's like 2.6% or something was higher than interest rates so the es will trade it a discount but right now the dividend yield let's say it's the same 2.5% just I'm just guessing and the dividend yield is four then it's going to trade you know then es will likely trade at a premium let's go next slide which is where we are today in the past 30 years there have been four major periods where",
  "30 years there have been four major periods where the es was priced higher than the SPX okay for only four periods in 30 years let's go next slide good when you see the visual that way these periods coincide with times when the Federal Reserve increased interest rates confirming that fluctuations in interest rates play an important role in creating discrepancies between the es and the SPX so again when you know this this all happens when when the when the FED raises rates and the cost to carry",
  "when the FED raises rates and the cost to carry is greater than the dividend yield that's when you get the that that kind of inversion M let's go to the next slide in June of 2022 the Federal Reserve announced a shocking 75 basis point rate hike for the first time in almost three decades which immediately resulted in an increase in the es to SPX spread we're just giving you some examples here again there's nothing there's nothing here that's tradable just give me the reason why yeah there's",
  "tradable just give me the reason why yeah there's nothing here that's necessarily tradeable it's just the reason why buy back more of that spread you put on buying back more of the 7577 yeah yeah those were just some trades we made the other day just to try to take advantage of to try to take a little bit of advantage of crude oil yeah so when I do that what I do then is I roll down your calls yeah roll down my calls to keep my other stuff in line very Dynamic there s enough let's go to the",
  "line very Dynamic there s enough let's go to the next slide so here are the statistics showing the percentage of times the es is higher than the SPX these results are consistent with our previous discussion however since the FED has started reducing interest rates is expected to continue doing so we might observe a tightening of the spread in the future so the percent of the time that the es is higher than the SPF and again this is not something that's tradable it's just something so you",
  "that's tradable it's just something so you understand when you look at the numbers kind of what's going on for the last 30 years 54% of the time since 2008 25% of the time but since 2022 85% of the time because we've been in a rate hike environment for the last three years um so just to give you you know I mean if that helps you know put some context because what happens is people roll the futures from one month to the next and they're why am I paying for this or I used to do this at a discount",
  "for this or I used to do this at a discount or why am I doing this why am I paying for this now when I used to do it a discount or why am I doing this at a discount I used to pay for it that's all it explains it let's go to next slide so for takeaways the es and the SPX both represent the S&P 500 but they can trade at slightly different prices due to the cost of of carry in Futures Trading the gap between these two prices is influenced by the relationship between interest rates and dividend",
  "relationship between interest rates and dividend yields however this Gap doesn't necessarily indicate Arbitrage opportunities as everything has already been priced in and if you see interest rates go back to two and a half and yields are dividend yields are two and a half then thing is going to trade exactly the same price exactly"
