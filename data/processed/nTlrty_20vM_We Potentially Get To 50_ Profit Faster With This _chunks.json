  "part two understanding premium decay in part one we showed that the realized premium Decay curve is very close to the theoretical one for at the money spy options since most Traders except for Dr Jim since most Traders except for Dr Jim sell out- of-the money options does the actual out-of-the money Decay also follow theoretical that is the question let's go next slide it's kind of a really good piece it's long though unlike at the money options the theoretical Decay for out of the money options",
  "theoretical Decay for out of the money options starts to decrease approaching expiration date so let's take a look at this historical data basically what we're going to show over the next bunch of slides is that there's a reason one of the reasons I didn't I and I'm not throwing Dr Jim on of the bus one of the reasons I didn't like the piece that he just did is we have mechanics and in our mechanics we focus on mansion out of the money options at 21 days or 50% we focus on managing at the money",
  "21 days or 50% we focus on managing at the money options um at let's just say 25% because because they Decay because the Decay rate is slower and you take more risk the reason I don't like selling in the- money options is because it messes up our mechanics that's fair because you have to use out ofth the- money mechanics and it doesn't make any sense let's go to the next slide um typical tasty study 45 days to expiration 10 years of data 16 Delta puts recorded the non-movement Curren is stock",
  "puts recorded the non-movement Curren is stock price less than a half a percent away from the original stock price order entry and let's take a look go to the next Slide John so just like the theoretical curve the out of- the money Theta tapers off approaching expiration this is due to the low probability of an option being in the money um at expiration the out of- the money the the out of- the money Theta tapers off that means when an option gets cheap it just kind of sits there sure because",
  "cheap it just kind of sits there sure because nobody wants to sell it's not worth selling yes put that way the risk reward the risk reward does is isn't there let's go next do move in either direction for or against right yeah how does pure premium Decay look for variety of Deltas so we'll look at Theta Decay for 510 16 30 and 50 Delta wide puts Delta puts if we hold the Delta constant on a percentage basis the further out- of-the money options Decay faster than the at the money options and",
  "Decay faster than the at the money options and then they taper so you can see here the further out of the money options Decay the fastest the at the money options Decay you know the the at the money options Decay much slower that's why if you did this with in the money options it would be incredibly confusing right I mean you know it would look like it's inverted you can see here the speed of the add of money options versus the 50 Delta option the reason that we show you this graph is because",
  "the reason that we show you this graph is because now you understand why well I mean you're beginning to understand why we manag the 50 Delta differently than we managed the the 510 6 510 16 20 Delta even the 30 Delta let's go to next slide look how much longer it takes to get there that's why over the past 10 years even though further further out of- the money options tend to reach 50% of their Max profit more quickly we need to consider the differences in premium between out of the money and",
  "in premium between out of the money and at the money puts so when you look at the at the money put has $750 in premium when you look at the out of the money put like the 16 Delta is $23 so the average money you make per trade is significantly less and the return on your investment is significantly less however when you manage a 21 days um the same trend as exiting trads with profits are exceed 50% it's it's it looks very similar so like you had the 750 213 and then you have the 134 61 it's",
  "had the 750 213 and then you have the 134 61 it's almost the same instead of 150 it's 133 instead of 75 it's 67 so on a nominal basis the at the money options collect much more premium per day yeah of course you're taking a lot more risk this is just the this is the symmetrical nature of trading options you take more risk you make more money Mone which is a perfect math model which is the way it should be a lot of time in other models or other places you're taking more risk you're not getting",
  "places you're taking more risk you're not getting compensated with the reward if you were right that's exactly right that's why we like this um let's go to next slide so by controlling for Del Delta we can quantify the direct contribution of theta to a trade's p&l return on investment and premium to collect out of the money options reach their 50% winner Target much quicker than at the money options which is why we manage strangles early 21 DTS or 50% and straddles at 25% of their Max profit",
  "or 50% and straddles at 25% of their Max profit that's why people that sell in the money options you get a little confused because you think you should be managing much earlier but you're really trading the premium right not the actual you're trading all these numbers are based on extra right not intrinsic right okay just to be clear"
