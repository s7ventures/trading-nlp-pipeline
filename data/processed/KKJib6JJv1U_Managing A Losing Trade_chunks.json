  "what do you mean when you say you won't add to a losing trade does that mean you won't roll for a debit and only a credit it means do as I say not as I do okay because if you watch the show you'll see sadof get a couple of trappy at times TR happy yes yes it has nothing to do with rolling for a debit or credit because there are plenty of times when I'll buy the guts and sell the wings back out doesn't have to always be for credit what that really means is if I have a losing trade on I won't make",
  "means is if I have a losing trade on I won't make an adjustment that requires more Capital like I won't move the losing side in the trade there are a lot of things that you can do with an existing trade that require additional Capital add more contracts average in adjust the side that just requires more capital and I won't do any of those has nothing to do with the role it has to do with using more Capital to potentially just tweak the trade"
