  "When I say I won't add to a losing trade, I mean I won't roll for a debit, only for a credit. It's important to stick to this rule to avoid getting trapped in losing positions. It doesn't always have to be for a credit, sometimes I buy the guts and sell the wings back out. The key is to not add to a losing trade.",
  "If I have a losing trade, I won't make adjustments that require more capital, such as adding more contracts or moving the losing side of the trade. I prefer to avoid using additional capital to tweak the trade."
