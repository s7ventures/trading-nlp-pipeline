  "We previously discussed anti-correlation in trading, focusing on longer durations. Now, let's explore anti-correlation in zero DTE trades. Does anti-correlation impact zero DTE trades? Does the VIX affect the S&P in zero DTE trades? Let's analyze. In trading, the market and volatility are typically anti-correlated.",
  "Volatility and market movements are generally anti-correlated. Today, the market is slightly down and VIX futures are also down. This indicates a muted move, but there is still potential for both the SPY and VIX to rise or fall. Trading opportunities are present for zero DT traders during market opens.",
  "Zero DT Traders are analyzing short premium positions in SPX and VIX based on overnight moves. Let's see how they have fared.",
  "We analyzed 18 months of data to determine if trades were correlated. We focused on zero DT strangles, buying wings to reduce P&L by $10. All trades were closed at 25% of max profit or held until the end of the day. Performance was compared based on the previous night's move in the spy and the vix. All trades were assumed to be exercised.",
  "VIX and all trades were assumed to be exercised at the mid price. Last night, the S&P and SPY were flat, making it hard to predict moves. We looked at 378 occurrences over the last 18 months and found that 35 Delta, 25 Delta, and 15 Delta strangles were successful.",
  "Strangles work regardless of market movement. Larger daily profits are more successful. Zero DTS strategy is effective when taken off at 25% of max profit. Focus on SPX down and VIX up as they are inversely correlated.",
  "There are 137 occurrences of SPX down VIX up out of 380, showing market strength when this happens. Win rate, daily P&L, and C bar are all high in these occurrences. Selling into VIX strength seems to be working well in this scenario.",
  "I would imagine that the SPX is up and VIX is down. There are 92 occurrences. The win rates are slightly lower, but the daily P&L is negative.",
  "When the VIX is up, avoid zero days. When volatility is low and the SPX is up, consider trading the VIX one day. This strategy has shown a high success rate.",
  "The study found that when the VIX is up, you make money. When the VIX is down, you lose money. The SPX doesn't have much impact. In 19 occurrences of the VIX being down, the win rate was 100% with a significant average profit. Premium came in on a down move.",
  "Premium came in on a down move with no clear catalyst. Selling zero DT premium was generally successful when the VIX fell overnight and the SPX had down moves accompanied by a contracting VIX. Trades following these patterns were extremely successful, but the sample size is too small to draw conclusions. The efficient market hypothesis advises not to put too much weight on recent chart action.",
  "Don't rely solely on recent chart action when trading. For active zero GT option sellers, consider selling into rising VIX regardless of XX movements. Selling into strength in volatility can be a good strategy."
