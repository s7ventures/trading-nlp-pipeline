  "anti-correlation and zero DT we did a piece on anti-correlation on Friday which was longer duration and I thought it was really interesting we got a ton of feedback so we're going to take it up another notch and go we're going to take anti-correlation to the zero DTE does anti-correlation really matter with respect to zero DTE trades does the vix matter when it when it relates to the snps with respect to zero DT trades let's take a look so the market and volatility are generally anti-correlated",
  "and volatility are generally anti-correlated when one Rises the other Falls right the Market's falling a little bit today and the vix Futures are falling a little bit today so unchanged right now yes so right now we got a problem Houston we got a problem we're in that 20% range yes it's a muted move while the effect is strong it's not absolute in practice all four combinations for spy and vix rising and falling are possible every Market open is exciting time for the zero DT Traders as they try",
  "exciting time for the zero DT Traders as they try and determine the best position to take or adjust how have short premium zero DT positions fared based on overnight moves in the spy and the vix is that a question that's a question without a volatility component to it o without a volatility component to it slight winner with big outlier moves how have short premium zero DT positions fared based on overnight moves in the SPX and the vix let's take a look and then we're going to look at them if",
  "a look and then we're going to look at them if they're correlated or not 18 months worth of data we're doing zero DT strangles we can buy the wings it's you'll see it here you can just reduce the p&l by $10 if you if you're buying Wings all trades were closed to 25% of Max profit or held to the end of the day if you didn't have any profits we contrasted the overall Performance Based on directions of the preceding night's move in the spy and the vix and all trades were assumed to be exercise at",
  "vix and all trades were assumed to be exercise at Mid price so last night for example was pretty pretty flattish you know the S&P really move and the the spy and the vixs were pretty flat overnight so it would be hard to say but sometimes you do get most time you get decent sized moves overnight let's go to next slide first we looked at 378 occurrences over the last 18 months and we determined that 35 Delta strangles 25 Delta strangles and 15 Delta strangles worked no matter what happened but",
  "strangles worked no matter what happened but daily pnls obviously the bigger ones worked better and the SAR is like what's your worst case they're all kind of in the same ballpark so the zero DTS have generally been working as a strategy if you take them off at 25% of Max profit right we're kind of more around that middle column that 25 Delta here we're going to look at the SPX down and the vix up because remember they're inversely correlated right so there's 100 and what that say 137",
  "right so there's 100 and what that say 137 occurrences of SPX down vix up out of 380 that's how shows how kind of strong the market spin when the SPX is down and the vix is up which is fairly normal your win rate is across the board super high your daily p&l super good and your c bar actually better than just on all the other occurrences so why do you think that is why the numers so good for SPX down vix up because you're selling into vix strength into the into the into the one day I would",
  "into the into the into the one day I would imagine yeah I think so too I I think because usually they rally that's what I think this is the SPX up vix down there are 92 occurrences here and the reason that this is interesting first of all I'm surprised by there's only 92 occurrences and second one with this is is the win rates are a little bit lower not significantly lower the win rates are lower but what's interesting here is that the daily p&l on all of these is down is a negative number what",
  "on all of these is down is a negative number what they're basically saying is when the vix is up do the zero days when the vix is down don't touch them right when volatility is low when the SPX is up and the vix is down this AR this is my argument for the vix one day same exact thing this is the whole freaking argument because um when you're doing the vix one day it doesn't make any sense when volatility is low just doesn't work vix up SPX up surprising a lot of occurrences this vix up SPX up",
  "a lot of occurrences this vix up SPX up when the vix is up you make money what's so interesting about this study is that vix up you make money vix down overnight you lose money the SPX doesn't really matter down vix down this one there's only 19 occurrences and this is the one that threw me off this slide cu the SPX the SPX down vix down the win rate was 100% in all 18 occurrences and the average p&l was huge seems weird to me how much different it is so basically premium came in on a down move",
  "it is so basically premium came in on a down move no cabar because there's no losers over the past 18 months selling zero DT premium was generally successful when the vix fell overnight and the xros overnight down moves in SPX accompanied Contracting vix very rarely about once a month trades on dates following those were extremely successful but the sample size is too small to draw conclusions the efficient market hypothesis tells us not to put too much weight into this recent chart action",
  "put too much weight into this recent chart action while making our trading decisions but for highly active zero GT option sellers looking for overnight Rising vix regardless of XX movements looks like a good place to start what's your takeaway from this selling to strength in volatility yes sell into volatility strength"
