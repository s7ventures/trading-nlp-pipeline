all right so we're going to talk about premium Decay today so theoretically in at the money options premium Decay looks like this accelerating in the last 50 days but basically when you're looking at premium Decay it's not a linear curve when you look further out in time it's a a lot slower Decay as you get to that 40 to 50-day time frame premium Decay starts to accelerate as you get closer to expiration of course there's a point of uh of risk reward baked into this of course you have faster decay as you get closer to expiration but that comes with a lot more risk uh versus something that's 40 or 50 days out in time does this hold true in real trading uh to test this we need to separate the occurrences with and without directional movement if the current stock price is close enough to the original stock price then we can say the positions p&l is purely from Premium Time Decay so we're we're isolating the stock movement and the Delta exposure that you get from short premium and we're just looking at the the data Decay relative to sideways moves in the market so getting to the next slide we're looking at spy we're doing the we're doing 2005 to present we sold the at the money puts um at a 50 Delta we recorded uh only the non-movement occurrences so we're looking at the time where the stock uh in this case spy was within 05% of the of the of the price on the previous day so it's basically looking at quote unquote n movements or Inside Moves In the market so first we're going to take a look at the distribution of non-movement occurrences in the 45-day taxation cycles and when we jump to the next one here as expected uh the longer duration the the lower the probability of the stock price coming back to well they're just talking about like expected move so if something moves $30 and it has a $3 expected move over a six-month period of time it's going to take it a lot longer to get back that price even if it goes All in One Direction but now remember from a volatility standpoint you're talking more about being a lot more mean reverting now we're not talking about volatility here just talking about stock stock price itself yeah a lot of times people get to smoke Opium and since we had this large move to the downside or to the upside so quickly that once it backs off it certainly can go back there again and again it is a 5050 shot on Direction but it's all about the implied volatility for an expected move which is 100% correct 68% of the time that's good yeah you had to add that one in that was good jump into the next slide so next we isolate these non-movement occurrences to test how closely the actual daily premium Decay matches the theoretical premium Decay um so this will get you know closer to that original Slide the first slide um that was a non-scientific slide we're going to look at at the actual curve of the realized premium Decay uh we'll jump to slide seven here so the curve of realized premium Decay looks very close to the theoretical one with the acceleration in Decay approaching expiration so as you get closer to expiration of course you're going to have faster premium Decay you only have certain amount of time especially when you're looking at these closer at the money options this goes to the other slide of mean rsion of price being much closer on a day-to-day basis or on a on a shorter duration because it's more of a 5050 shot versus versus a longer duration where you don't have that same sort of coin flip we've known that obviously in the bull markets in the past years tested the call side more often than the put side if we control for the directional bias does the call Premium Decay look similar to the put premium Decay and so again we're looking at these sideways moves versus you know a long period of time where we're only you know we're looking at the the total directional move the this whole study is looking at just those like inside move periods of time and days so the actual premium Decay for calls matches the put premium decay in the hypothetical curve so again you know when you take the directional move out of the equation the Decay on calls and puts are relatively the same as the the takeaway yes here yes agreed agreed takeaways here Delta is one of the largest risks when trading and can adversely impact traded performance and this again goes to um what we were just talking about here we took Delta out of the equation for this study and just looked at premium Decay and tried to kind of compare calls versus puts Delta of course has been the biggest directional or has been the biggest issue for positions over this period of time when we control for Delta the changes in the under underlying price we clearly see where our Returns come from they come from premium Decay that's why we're always talking about looking at high volatility and and mean reversion of volatility theoretical premium Decay very closely matches actual premium Decay since most Traders sell out of money options does actual out of the money option Decay also follow the theoretical that will be covered in part two oo O Part Two looming went that went through that pretty quickly really it was just about price movement right I mean you're looking at probability of pop on expected move that's really what we're
