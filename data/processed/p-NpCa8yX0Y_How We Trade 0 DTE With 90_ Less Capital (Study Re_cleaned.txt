you're ready for a little zero DT interesting study because we've never done this before picking wings for zero DT strangles how do you pick a wing how do I pick a a wing yeah I mean for me it's been on the Zero days and and this is what we always talk about sponsored by the CBOE on Thursdays I've been going with the $20 that's been 20 to 30 I I'll spread it out a little bit $230 wide I go with my shorsh Delta around 2025 I like to collect around fiveish dollars and I go from there that's what I've been doing this is a piece of research that's designed to show you that if you want the cheapest possible Wing what it does as far as buying power savings is let's go to the first slide I'll show you all right let's do it we've never done anything quite like this so trades with undefined risks such as short strangles have higher probabilities of profit and upside than potential similar defined risk strategy such as IR Condors undefined risk zero DT positions are buying power prohibitive however because of regulatory BPR minimums um do not account for time remaining so adding cheap far out of the money long options can give similar results to undefined risk trades while controlling buying power so how do we pick those far the money options so Tony if I if I was to sell right now let's just say a 30 Delta strangle zero DT in the SPX what is my buying power requirement 30 Delta just a strangle 30 Delta call 30 Delta put strangle SPX 0 DT uh let's take a quick look sou off it's going to be huge you know that right it's going to be huge it's going to be yeah probably around 100,000 but I'm not sure uh I think it's a little bit less but let's see Zero day 30 Delta uh approximately 100 oh you're a little bit more 120,000 20% almost exactly of a $6,000 index the buying power requirement for a on lot strangle right 30 Deltas how much money premium you taking it about uh I mean at this I mean obviously it's at different times but let's just call it $8 okay so in order to make Max $8$ eight and a half dollars but eight and a half $9 whatever let's just say Max to make $800 hour today you got to put up 120 Grand a lot of money it's a lot of money um but people trade these products a lot yep yep so obviously you can do a normal cond or things like that but what if you wanted to keep that synthetic strangle on but reduce your buying power requirement to from 120 to under $10,000 let's say right and have essentially the exact same position on that could be interesting right yep definitely that's what the study is take the 120 which is cost prohibitive for everybody and turn it and turn it into I don't know 8,000 10,000 something like that let's take a look that's correct that's correct because as we wrote In Here regulatory BPR minimums do not account for time remaining so that's the beauty of this now is there really $120,000 in Risk in that one lot strangle and the answer is no not at all because the market can't move that much in a day but that's just the way the right we would be we would be lock limit and closed right so so that so but if you buy a cheap option you can reduce that let's go next line so using nearly two years of data in the SPX zero DTS we looked at 40 Delta 30 Delta which Tony just looked at and 20 Delta triangles at the market open now we got to look for wings so we're going to go looking for closest to at the money put with a cheap bid of 30 cents 20 cents or 10 cents so the bid had to be 30 cents okay I uh Tony because I'm not looking at that page right now y if you were looking right now on the what is the what is the cheapest Z 30 bid yes uh Le let's just say on the put side you would be about uh 6070 would be your short and your long would be 6,000 so say $70 on the put side oh okay you mean you're saying an option with an option a 30 Cent bid is your is the one you buy right yeah you you're saying $700 right I'm sorry $700 6,070 to 6,000 or or $700 because everything is 10 times you use about $6500 in buying power there you go they're exactly right yep and on the call side it would be whatever on the call call side it would be like uh approximately now guys you know this is 6,90 to about um 6115 uh so you'd be using obviously uh a little less a little less buying power on the on the upside and you get stop stop stop stop what they're doing on the call side they're taking the same distance so was 700 hour it was 700 points the downside because that's the W the put they're going to do 700 to the upside so and we we'll show you what those prices come out to it's very interesting they were're going to repeat the with put skew your with put skew your your put spread is going to be so much wider that's where all the buying power is going to come from that's right your call side's only going to be you know $30 wise it GNA be half as much 300 you mean 300 yeah so I'm sorry 300 right everything is 10 times an SPS I apologize okay We examined the the average total cost of the Wings resulting buying power as well as how often they provideed actual protection okay how often sometimes probably never I don't even know let's go next slide okay we'll start with 40 Delta strangles this explain the whole thing take two seconds the 30 the cheapest put with the 30 um at 30 cents was actually 37 cents because you had to buy it somewhere the mid price the 20 cent put was 25 cents the 10 cent put was 20 cents makes total sense to me on the call side the calls were obviously more expensive um because if you went the exact same distance they were .71 43 um but none of that mely matters because the average daily buying power reduction to make this trade just like Tony said before we said it was about $700 wide is it turned out to be $8,200 okay so all these numbers are a fraction of 120,000 for the naked position the amount of time that those protection came into play 4% basically zero never never on the call side much more often but um uh 40% on the 30 Delta Wings on the 30 cent wings and then a little bit lower on the other ones the the purpose and the main takeaway here is just to show you that in the end you can put up 90 to 95% less Capital by just buying the junkiest wing you can find right that's what this is that's exactly you're exactly right yeah and you can take I mean I know they I know for the study they want to you know keep it symmetrical on both sides but you could take a lot less upside risk because the options are so much cheaper priced like going that extra 25 sorry $250 to $300 wide to save a nickel or 10 or 15 cents isn't really worth it in at least in my opinion let's go next slide it's the same setup you can see here the same situation the fun thing is on the 10 on the 10 C puts those never protected you ever in the history of watches but that makes sense too I guess all these slides are going to be you know virtually the same the the whole purpose here was just to show you that regardless of what strangle you sell to collect all your money the wings are going to be about the same let's go to next slide Beth the 20 Deltas they're all virtually the same and the percentages are the same and the buying power reductions pretty much the same further you go away from that the money the the cheaper you put a little less money up but the purpose the point here is it's still 90 to 95% less than selling a naked than selling a naked stri Le in the SPX it's much more of a strategic play on buying power and there's I can't come I can't think off the top of my head of any reason why I wouldn't do this now I've challenged you on this when you've done strangles and I know we're doing the show real quickly and you'll just do a strangle for a short period of time um in SPX near the end of the day using a lot of buying power and I know you're only keeping it for the next you know 45 minutes or less in the trade but you would probably hold on even longer if you had that Wing attached to it and you'd probably roll up the untested side a little bit little bit quicker too and maybe stay in the trade for more juice you know elevate your game a little bit sadov let's go to the last slide giving up some profits to purchase far the money wings and control your buying power is just a reality for those who like to trade zero DT strangles if you really want Iron Condors that function like strangles start by finding a cheap long put and then add a symmetric call the more buying power VPR you're able to commit the cheaper a put you can use due to put skew using cheap long calls resulted in more expensive long puts there's nothing wrong with that uh as a trade but you're really selling iron Condors then so in reality you can balance how much you're willing to spend on wings with the resulting BPR um effects differently every day but now that we know what we're getting into when we look to sell zero DT strangles
