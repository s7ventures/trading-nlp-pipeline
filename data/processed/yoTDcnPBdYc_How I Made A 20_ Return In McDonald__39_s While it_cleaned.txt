what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video we are going to cover a call [Music] diagonal all right so we've got a little bit of a pullback in the market but one stock in particular has just been whacked over the in the overnight session here and that is McDonald's there are some eoli news that came out uh the stock is down let's call it 7% right now it was down uh all the way down to like 280 something at some point in the overnight session so it definitely has had a big pullback here it's a relatively low implied volatility underlying most of the time but currently because of this move you could see IV rank getting into the 100 handle over 100 means that it's exceeding its 52- we High uh today right now so it's as high as volatility has been uh I think this is an interesting time to get a little bit of Delta you know be a little contrarian here into this move again 20po move we've erased you know a month and a half two months of price action here even though the stock has had a very significant rally of late um I'm going to look at a called diagonal spread even though again because volatility IV rank is high it doesn't necessarily mean that actual implied volatility is high the actual implied volatility in in McDonald's is actually relatively low when you look at this 20% 24% so it makes getting Delta cheap if something has high implied volatility it's expensive to buy Delta or to get Delta via long premium when volatility is low it's relatively cheaper uh just because of the difference in the volatility here so we're going to look at December let's buy this 300 strike uh it's a it's the first strike out of the money but we've got $5 wide strikes here I'm going closer at the money because I know that this is going to be a relatively cheap call diagonal spread for me relative to the width it's going to used five or six $700 in in in premium here now the high we got to and we could see this here 52e high of 317 let's play for somewhere a little bit under the 52 we High here we'll go to the 310 strike for our short option now I'm picking up 18 long Deltas here in a stock that's trading at let's just round it and make it $300 uh so we're getting you know $3,000 $4,000 worth of exposure in Delta for just five or 600 bucks so this is a a reflection of of two things first of all you know the leverage that you get with options as well as the low implied volatility here again I said it was cheap to get Delta here it's cheap to get exposure to stock or in effect Delta via this called diagonal spread so stock is rallying here so this spread has moved pretty significantly just to move uh just to show this on a risk profile at expiration is kind of a hard look because these are calendarized I like to go to this Theo this is kind of what our risk profile looks like so uh basically a 5050 shot using the analysis mode here we can actually kind of simulate the passage of time you'll see the risk profile moving that way you can even take out some implied volatility you could take out some from the long option as well so you can see it's got a very interesting uh asymmetric sort of upside to this position and uh as we keep waiting we are missing out on some value here so we'll see if we can get filled at 590 uh 593 here 595 you can see the stock is rallying a little bit it's at 296 now so we'll try at 595 see if we can get filled somewhere around that probably going to have to move it up to 310 that's probably where we'll get filled here through routed it at 310 got it price improved at 604 uh a little bit of long Delta in McDonald's into this dip basically at the high of the session uh this might be a good timing on that trade do have a position that we have to manage today uh one of our winning trades we we had a McDonald's position it was trading at 297 the stock has rallied about3 or $4 from here we had a slightly bullish lean with a called diagonal spread but really A lot of the value has come from this short option that we sold uh in the November monthly expiration at the 310 strike we can go and look at that here uh just to give you an idea it's trading at about 35 cents is right here when we put this trade on was trading at about $4 and that that's come from time Decay changes implied volatility volatility has come in significantly after that big drop uh so we've gained about $3 almost $4 in value out of that option that option we sold at 390 is now trading at 30 so uh with that position the long option has only come in about $2 even though the stock has gone basically nowhere so we we bought it at 10 and it's now trading at$ 759 so we've lost $2.50 from the long option we've gained almost $3 $3.50 on that short option so most of the value came from the short option so that value is what is giving us this profit potential selling out of the December call buying back the November position here 730 we got filled about 2 cents above the mid price closing that one out for $126 profit about uh let's called 20% return on Capital 30% there so nice little trade over about a 3 week time frame
