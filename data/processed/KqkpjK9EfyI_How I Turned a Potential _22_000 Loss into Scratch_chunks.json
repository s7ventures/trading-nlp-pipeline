  "super long-term trade but it's definitely one that was very painful at points and I think that was kind of what we're trying to highlight here just being mechanical rolling reducing position size or uh reducing Delta adding positive extrinsic value maybe adjusting the strikes a little bit leaning long into down moves short into up moves all those things are are part of this adjustment so um you know just a just a a good one and it's a high volatility underlying so that helps as well let's do it",
  "underlying so that helps as well let's do it all right jumping into the first page here we don't have to spend a ton of time on here but uh if you have a tasty trade account you can pull up all these uh transactions on the tasty trade follow page so um when we get to the first slide here it'll show you all my transactions from start to finish for this trade and when you click on it it'll open up gives you gives you my little comments on everything but um you could see all the transaction there",
  "but um you could see all the transaction there on the follow page cool little feature of course we show it uh throughout the show as well uh jumping into the next slide side two so this is my order chains and you can see I started with the 85 put sold a call against it rolled out in time adjusted the strike scalped out of the calls you know just trading this position um into what was a huge move in the stock and we're going to take a look at that too in in a couple sides but it ended up being",
  "too in in a couple sides but it ended up being basically a scratch I lost 42 bucks on it overall um a big old nothing Burger in my book um after you see the chart I think we'll justify or we uh explain a lot of why I closed this position when I did so jumping over to the third slide just to look at the chart of this position so I've I've realized a lot of times like with these segments people are like oh like you know why didn't you just do do nothing or whatever and so I wanted to zoom out a",
  "nothing or whatever and so I wanted to zoom out a little bit because the actual adjustment chart it's still a big move but I wanted to put some context to it you know this is a stock that traded from let's call it 145 to 100 for the better part of a year so it it's and that's a big range it's 40 Point range you know top to bottom it's a big range and I was looking at a put where I sold the put when the stock was somewhere around you know 105 110 kind of the lower end of where it traded in this",
  "kind of the lower end of where it traded in this range I sold the 85 strike put so it's probably 20 points out of the money 20% down move no big deal for the position right well you could see over the next month and a half the stock went from 110 down to $60 so 50% down move and people always ask about you know what do you do in these you know what happens if the stock crashes well this is a crash this is a this is a crash in a single name stock so we're going to walk through how we got back to",
  "so we're going to walk through how we got back to a manageable position basically a scratch on this trade so keep that in mind this is a crash type scenario in terms of the management of this position so jumping into the fourth slide here uh we're going to take a look here at the Delta of the adjustments versus the underlying price so on the left side here you can see the Delta of each adjustment so I started with like 20 delt long every one of my adjustments into the or my adjustments to the",
  "my adjustments into the or my adjustments to the downside are short Delta adjustments so I'm flat out Delta you can see the stock has gone from 10 107 10 18ish down to 80 back up to 90 90 to to 75 75 to 60 and kind of Flatline there the stock is currently trading not much higher than where we were 75 right now so it's had a you know 50% range in terms of the stock price going from 110 to 60 in the span of three months crash type moves yeah you know it's a single name stock so this is possible",
  "know it's a single name stock so this is possible you know you don't typically see a 50% crash in in the market as a whole but here's how we how we battle through this yeah and this this lacked a lot of two-sided action this is basically a straight line down straight line down yeah no bailout you get you know within a month it was trading at 65 and it's moved nowhere since then so I was 20 points 15 20 points in the money within a matter of of weeks yeah which is which is a you know big loss",
  "weeks yeah which is which is a you know big loss we're talking about, $2,000 you know in in potential loss on that position had I done nothing and just Clos a position yeah um jumping over to the fifth slide here so when we look at implied volatility rank obviously you can see we started High 75 IV rank got up into the handle I think that was after an earnings or something like that um but it's a perpetually High volatility underlying as you can see in the ivy rank you can also if we jump to",
  "see in the ivy rank you can also if we jump to the six slide here you could see uh the actual implied volatility of the underlying you know we've had 8090 implied volatility we've had all the way down to you know 50 60 so it's one that's had changes at implied volatility even though you had a down move here so it started with high implied vol volatility stock gets cut in half and volatility actually contracted in this underlying so that was one thing that didn't work out in our favor but um it",
  "thing that didn't work out in our favor but um it wasn't needed in terms of of this position yeah and even right now with n phase at a 58 IV rank so kind of on the lower end of uh I should say the middle of the range it still has 80% implied volatility so yeah still plenty of Premium relative to the stock price which might have to sell another put here there you go you might you might get me to get back in this but yeah IV rank is always good to look at and understand so you have context around",
  "look at and understand so you have context around the actual implied volatility of the product which is on the right hand side of the the options table but the actual implied volatility is really what tells you uh about the option premium relative to the stock price so as long as we have an actual implied volatility of 50 60 70 80% I really don't what the IV rank is because there's still going to be plenty of Premium to sell relative to the notional risk of the stock which translates into a",
  "risk of the stock which translates into a high return on Capital potential and efficient use of capital etc etc I would always rather sell premium in a zero IV rank product that has 60% implied volatility versus a 100 a 100 IV ranked product that has 15% IV MH because 15% IV tells me nothing I don't care what the IV rank is there's nothing to sell well it tells you the market expects us to go nowhere yeah you're not getting paid to risk right it going somewhere and taking that one step further",
  "going somewhere and taking that one step further if you're in a higher IV product you have a lot more flexibility when you're rolling from one month to the next you can manipulate that product a lot more easily where a low IV product like a 15 20% IV product like a TLT for example you can't really move your strike like you can't buy back Feb go to March and move at 10 points it just does you can't do it because there's no premium to offset your premium in the near-term cycle so just just more",
  "premium in the near-term cycle so just just more context around trading actively in higher IV products it's a lot easier to manipulate your risk well said Thank you getting over to the last slide here then what everybody's been waiting for the chart of all the adjustments so you can see I started out with just the naked put stock dropped from you know 90 to 75 80ish I sold the call against it a little bit of chop there from the end or the middle of October to the end of October is or early",
  "of October to the end of October is or early November had a little bit of chop there uh which benefited me I took that position rolled out in time I took that position which we had a huge move the second huge move from 80 or from 90ish down to you know 60 70ish I close out the call I just lean long so this is something you hear us mention all the time at a certain point you to make the decision to to be long or short at a given point or you you have to go inverted or do something else you know",
  "have to go inverted or do something else you know that decision is up to you for me I I said you know what the stock has gone down 40 50% I'm going to lean long here so I stayed with the put you had a little bit of a rally back stock goes from 60 65 is I saw the call against it I go inverted on that position that's kind of your white flag all right I'm waiting for a little bit of a directional move but I want this stock to chop around I want to take advantage of time decay all those things work",
  "advantage of time decay all those things work in your favor um from the middle of November up to basically the early December portion I take that inverted strangle because we had a little a nice move higher from 60 up to 75ish I take that inverted strangle which is right in the middle of my strikes buy the guts sell the wings so I do that with a roll out in time so essentially you take your inverted position you Buy in that intrinsic value and you roll to an out of the- money strangle and",
  "and you roll to an out of the- money strangle and you'll see my profit potential and my break even you know the amount of width between my strike and break even doesn't change all that much because I'm doing that for basically a scratch I'm just taking where my I'm moving where my risk is when you're buying the guts selling the wings you're moving where your risk is and that's what I did on on on that adjustment from there all we needed was a little bit of sideways action remember we started",
  "little bit of sideways action remember we started with the 85 stri short put the Stock's trading at 75 right now and it was as low as 60 or 50 something um adjusting those strikes we're able to lower our where our our risk is and lower where our our um our strikes are and when you get a month or two of chop which is what we got from you know uh end of November to basically the end of December stock stayed wrapped around 70ish you capture all that decay capture all that extrinsic value and",
  "that decay capture all that extrinsic value and ultimately are able to to get back to a scratch on a position that's you know $1,500 loser at one point yeah and this is all of these charts are very similar when you look at the anatomy of a trade uh segments that we do the blue line is where the stocks moving and really our goal is to make sure that we can move the green dotted lines which is our our break evens closer to the stock price so that like said eventually if you get that sideways",
  "like said eventually if you get that sideways action all of a sudden all of your premium that you've collected thus far kind of comes in in that sense so um you just need the stock to behave at some point in time yeah and trading small allows you to manipulate this the strikes from month one month to the next add a leg here remove a leg here like you see here like at one point he just had the short put then had multiple legs and I was able to manipulate that short putut down while still in the",
  "that short putut down while still in the break evens around the stock price range so"
