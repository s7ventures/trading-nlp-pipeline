  "have been following and trading with you for years. I have been profitable every year, but this year has been a struggle. Is this normal? I thought I had figured it out, but maybe not. Have you experienced this before? I question myself daily about what I did wrong. Remember, you are only as good as your last trade. Stay mechanical and watch your size.",
  "As a trader, it is important to analyze the numbers and monitor your success rate. If you are consistently correct in your trades 70-80% of the time, you should be profitable in the long run. Keep track of your performance and adjust your strategies as needed.",
  "I believe this is normal, as Tony mentioned."
