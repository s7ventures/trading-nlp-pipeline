  "Last week saw a significant move lower in trading. Despite this, volatility remained low until Friday. The sell-off may be short-lived, with potential for cyclical sideways movement with a slight bullish bias leading into the end of the year. Opinions vary, with some predicting a crash while others remain more optimistic.",
  "I am focused on trading what is in front of me. I believe there is more risk in lower volatility levels than in higher ones."
