  "Welcome to Option Trades Today. I'm Tony Batista and I have a trade idea for you on February 20th, 2025. This idea was inspired by an email I received. Let's take a look at what's happening in the market.",
  "The market is showing movement today, with S&P down 1% and trading at 52 handles. Volume is just under 700,000. NASDAQ is down 205, Russell down 31, and Dow down 576.",
  "The Dow is down 576 points, the weakest in the group on a percentage basis. Volatility is only up 20 cents, with the S&P about 10 handles off its lows. Volatility is already off its lows by about 15 or 20 cents, not giving much movement or a green light to the down move in the market. If volatility starts ticking up, the market may see more movement.",
  "expect the market to go lower today. Bonds are up 13 ticks, trading over 115. I check my watch list, focusing on high option volume. You can create and save your own list or use curated lists. I prefer the high option volume list, while my son prefers the S&P 100 or NASDAQ 100. I also keep an eye on earnings reports.",
  "I focus on NASDAQ 100 earnings and high IV rank stocks for selling premium. I have a few trade options to discuss, excluding Royal Caribbean due to recent performance.",
  "The stock is down almost 10% today, currently at $23. I looked at the trade page and analyzed April options with no upcoming earnings. The platform offers various modes for trading analysis.",
  "The open interest on Royal Caribbean is too low, making the markets wide and untradable. Liquidity is necessary for trading.",
  "chose Royal Caribbean, with an Ivy rank up 10% in the last five days, ranking 75 on the high option volume list. The implied volatility change (IVX) is also up 10%. Intel (INTC) is another stock to consider.",
  "Looking at INTC (Intel), it has a good IV rank of 75 and a decent IVX 5-day change. However, compared to Royal Caribbean, which had a better trade opportunity, INTC is not as appealing. With no earnings looming in April, the monthly implied volatility is high at 56%. But considering it is only a $25 stock, I would pass on putting a trade on INTC.",
  "When looking at a $25 stock, consider a 20 Delta option with a 50% chance of a touch. Keep in mind that you may only receive around $150 in profit. The buying power to credit received ratio is high, at $150 to $250.",
  "The profit potential for this trade is good at 66%, but it may take longer than three weeks to see results. To make a 50% return, the price only needs to move around 75 cents. If you have a directional opinion, consider entering the trade for four to five weeks.",
  "If you want to go with a directional trade in Intel by selling premium, I have no problem with that. I don't have a directional bias in Intel, so I was looking at a delta neutral trade. The negative one Delta and 15 Delta on each side only yield a total of one dollar on the trade, which is not enough premium for me. However, it does offer a good buying power to credit receive ratio.",
  "The power of credit to receive ratio is why many people make trades, especially in smaller accounts. It's better to do a defined risk trade in a larger price stock than selling premium in a smaller price stock. The stock I will be trading is Google, as suggested by an emailer. Let's look at the chart of Google.",
  "Let's look at Google's chart. The opinion is that the stock may trade sideways or slightly higher. It's important to ensure that the monthly implied volatility aligns with your assumption before making a trade.",
  "Google has a good correlation to the market and has been consolidating recently. There is a gap that may fill soon, potentially leading to an upside.",
  "I'm not a chartist, but I like that the IV rank was only 19 for the strategy they're doing. Let's take a look at what they want to do. Google's IV rank is low, so I'm not going to look to sell premium in here.",
  "Sell premium in here and they didn't want to sell premium in here either. They're omnidirectional slightly long in Google. They asked me to come up with a trade where I'm buying April options and selling out-of-the-money options in the weekly options. The first thing I have to look at here is the monthly implied volatility of all of these months. They're basically the same, which I like. I would prefer these to be higher in the front month.",
  "looking to take advantage of the higher front month volatility compared to the daily or weekly premium they will be selling. This strategy aims to accumulate Google stock in a smaller account.",
  "I am accumulating Google stock because I am bullish on it. I am looking at April options with a monthly implied volatility of 28. I want the April volatility to be the same or lower than the volatility I am selling in February and March. This is all we can control at entry.",
  "I am buying April 185 calls with a 50 Delta and selling weekly options with eight days to go at a strike out of the money for $6.2.",
  "You can potentially trade at a better price than me by a few cents or a nickel. The current mid price is $5.95. If you were able to get filled at that price, your buying power would be $595. With a Delta of 18, you are controlling 18 shares of stock. Your positive Theta Decay is $0.867 per day, which is favorable.",
  "Positive Theta Decay Delta to match assumption, slightly long 18 Deltas, buying power effect at 595. No pop on trade due to unpredictable volatility in both months. Analyze Tab can be used to adjust volatility and see impact.",
  "If you want to see the stock go up, aim for it to slowly reach 87.5 within the next two to three days before expiration. Consider rolling the trade to March calls on Wednesday or Thursday of next week.",
  "I typically don't trade weekly options, but after reviewing the market, I found tight markets with plenty of open interest in each month. The implied volatility and volume in Google align with the assumption. The ideal trade would involve selling premium if Google goes higher.",
  "When trading, focus on finding the right Delta and ensuring proper implied volatility skew. Utilize the follow page to preview trades in advance. For example, I entered a trade at 10:16 with the stock slightly lower and an IVR around 20.",
