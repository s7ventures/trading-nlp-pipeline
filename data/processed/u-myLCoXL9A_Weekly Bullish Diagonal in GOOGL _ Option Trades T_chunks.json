  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the B batist and I have a trade idea for you today February 20th 2025 and this one is actually inspired by an email that was sent to me so you're going to want to watch this because it's one of your own somebody from out there who had a question to me you can always email me at bat tasty.com or just do a comment right there on YouTube I answer those too love to hear from you but first as we always do let's see what's going on in the market even p is",
  "let's see what's going on in the market even p is finally having a day where they're moving around 1% down 52 handles on &p volume of just under 700,000 that's pretty good volume because you'll remember when you watch the show that we always talk about the volume when it's being low and it was around 800,000 at 2:30 in the afternoon Central Standard time you got 700,000 already a busy day NASDAQ down 205 Russell down 31 Russell the weakest of the group but the Dow down 576 also the weakest of",
  "group but the Dow down 576 also the weakest of the group on a percentage basis the odd thing volatility not really getting out of its own way up 20 cents even the S&P is about 10 handles off of their lows uh volatility already off of its lows by about 15 or 20 cents not giving a lot of movement or a lot of um green light to this down move in the market I would think volatility would have uh uptick a little bit more key on volatility uh volatility starts up ticking then this Market is going to",
  "starts up ticking then this Market is going to go lower today B bonds up 13 ticks bonds finally trading over 115 all right as I always do I like to look at my watch list I go to my watch list here I have my high option volume list you can put any list that you want here you can make your own list and save it or you can go to some of the curated list that we have here I like the high option volume list I know my son likes the uh S&P 100 or the NASDAQ 100 I like to click on these earnings so I",
  "NASDAQ 100 I like to click on these earnings so I get rid of all the earnings in these stocks I like to look at something that has high IV rank when looking to sell premium and I go through these and find out which one is a name that I like to trade I have two or three that I'm going to show you before I get to the trade I'm going to show you why I'm not making a trade in Royal Caribbean because Royal Caribbean really fits me here here's a stock that was a high flyer it's down almost 10% today",
  "that was a high flyer it's down almost 10% today $23 now it's just down 25 a moment ago would have looked like to have done something in here so I looked at the trade page um I'm sorry going into the table mode that's what I like but you can go to curve mode you can go to crypto if you want to P trading analysis you can do anything you want the platform is quite Dynamic and I looked at April options no earnings looming because we already uh did away with that I have the open interest on here",
  "away with that I have the open interest on here this is not volume for the day this is open interest there's just not enough open interest in here markets actually get a little bit wide too when you have a $2 option that's 50 cents wide or a 50 Cent option that's almost a dollar and change wide here on the 185 puts it just makes it untradable in my you have to have liquidity so Royal Caribbean uh has to go away I go back to my list here uh why did I pick Royal Caribbean I should show you that",
  "did I pick Royal Caribbean I should show you that that was probably the most important thing the ivy rank was up 10% over the last five days and the ivy rank was 75 one of the highest Ivy ranks on the board in the high option volume list and then also the 10% uh ivx that's the the implied Val change over the last 5 days is up 10% I really love to put on a premium selling trade uh when you see that number so big all right next one that I was going to look at was INTC which is Intel and Intel you",
  "to look at was INTC which is Intel and Intel you see it down here on the bottom a good IV rank of 75 the ivx 5day change good not as great as that uh trade that we just saw in Royal Caribbean so if there was between the two I'd probably like to do Royal Caribbean but it's up three and a half% so let's look at why I wouldn't put a trade on an Intel no earnings looming in April we'll take a look at that good monthly implied volatility 56% that's big but you look at this it's only a $25 stock when",
  "but you look at this it's only a $25 stock when you go to around a one standard deviation or even a 20 Delta option 25 Delta option which has a 50% chance of a touch remember that by the way you're only getting around a150 a lot of these trades that I put on for you at least trying to lead a horse to water here I close at a dollish profit profit there's not a lot of um buying power you're going to use here so the buying power to credit receive ratio is quite High $150 to to 250 bucks the",
  "ratio is quite High $150 to to 250 bucks the probably profit is good at 66% but you have to go into this trade knowing that you're going to be in it for the duration probably much more than the three weeks that I like to be in a trade you're probably going to have to be into this Trade four or five uh weeks and then to make 50% on this trade it's really only around 75 cents I don't know to me it's like watching uh paint dry if you had a a directional opinion on here and you wanted to go with a",
  "opinion on here and you wanted to go with a directional trade in Intel by selling premium then I would have no problem with that I don't have a directional bias in Intel so I was just looking at a completely um delta neutral type trade you'll notice the negative one Delta and if you go out to the 15 Delta on on each side here you're going to get only a dollar uh total on the trade just not enough premium uh for me although it is a good buying power to credit receive ratio and that's what uh",
  "power to credit receive ratio and that's what uh makes a lot of people put on these trades especially in smaller accounts I'd rather you do a defined risk trade in a in a in a larger price stock than do a selling premium trade in a smaller price stock which brings me to the stock that I'm going to trade because this emailer uh sent it into me I decided to do what they wanted to do I figured take a good shot they want to take a look at Google let's go to a chart of Google first here is their",
  "let's go to a chart of Google first here is their opinion not my opinion necessarily but I don't hate it I I like the idea that's why I did I would never do a trade just because somebody wrote in or I was listening to a podcast or something else like that the Assumption or the strategy or the setup in the in the stock has to meaning the monthly apply volatility has to fit your assumption okay there their feeling here at Google is you know what it might go sideways to a little bit higher I'm",
  "it might go sideways to a little bit higher I'm okay with that too Google has a good um uh follows the market it has a good correlation uh to the market typically uh relatively strong it has not been strong as of late had this big gap down uh back here uh in early February it's been going sideways and consolidating they said they liked it on a chart there's another Gap here that they said that might fill one of these two gaps they're going to take the upside I'm not a chartist I don't really",
  "take the upside I'm not a chartist I don't really care about that but I like that the ivy rank was only 19 for the strategy they're doing so what let's take a look at they want to do uh first before I do that let's go back into our list here and see where Google is the IV rank is basically unchanged over the last five days the the ivx 5day change is basically going change over the last five days the IV rank is low so I'm not going to look to sell premium in here and they didn't want to sell",
  "sell premium in here and they didn't want to sell premium in here either so they're omnidirectional slightly long in Google they asked me to come up with a trade where I'm buying April options and selling out of the money options in the weekly options so what do I have to do here the first thing I have to look at here is what is the monthly implied volatility of all of these months well they're basically the same I like that I don't I would prefer these to be higher in the front month the 8 day",
  "these to be higher in the front month the 8 day the 15 days the 22 days the 29 days um than what I'm paying but I certainly don't want the April volatility to be significantly higher than the than the daily or weekly uh pre prium that I'm going to be selling because I'm going to be doing this each week so this is a this is a trial by putting something on that makes logical sense that somebody wants to do to try to accumulate in a smaller account accumulate Google because they like it they're",
  "accumulate Google because they like it they're bullish on the stock you have to have the same assumption so I went to the uh April options with a monthly applied volatility of 28 I would not want this April volatility to be three four five points higher than the monthly implied volatility that I'm selling in February and March eventually so I would like it at least on Entry because that's all we can control to be the same or this April volatility to be lower all right so what am I doing here",
  "to be lower all right so what am I doing here I'm buying the April uh um uh April 185 calls the just at the money call or just out of the money they were in the money or right at the money yesterday before the stock was down so I'm buying the 185 calls in April they have around a 50 Delta and I'm going to sell the weekly options with eight days to go I'm going to go a strike out of the money and sell the 127 and a halfs now I did this for $6.2 you can do it uh better than me by a couple of",
  "you can do it uh better than me by a couple of pennies maybe a nickel or two I did it sorry not $52 $62 um Mid price right now is 5.95 so you can do it much better than I did obviously the buying power is exactly what you're going to pay for uh pay for it let's say you were able to get filled at $5.95 then your buying power is going to be $595 uh Delta you're controlling 18 shares of stock your Theta Decay is positive $85 $867 cents a day so I like that positive uh uh Theta Decay Delta to match",
  "that positive uh uh Theta Decay Delta to match my assumption they want to be slightly uh long long 18 Deltas um buying power effect is good at 595 why is there no pop on this trade that's a great question why is there no pop on this trade because we can't predict what volatility is going to do in either one of these months in either one of these months now you can go to the analyze Tab and look to put on this trade and then move the volatility if you want to to see it up or down what happens",
  "if you want to to see it up or down what happens but let me tell you something before you even start doing all of that what you really want the stock to do is you want the stock to slowly go up to 87 uh and a half and stop with the next two or three days before expiration when we will look to roll this trade on around Wednesday or Thursday of next week and I'm going to roll it to the March calls I'll roll them here now why would I put on this trade in the weekly options when I don't usually put",
  "in the weekly options when I don't usually put on trades in weekly options well I went through each month you'll notice here that the markets are P or two wide in every month plenty of open interest uh in in all of them plenty of good tight markets in each one of them so the scenario or the assumption that the person had fits the implied volatility and it fits the amount of of volume in Google all we need to for them to get right is is if Google goes higher to find risk trade selling premium",
  "goes higher to find risk trade selling premium getting the right Delta that you want and making sure on Entry that you put on the proper uh implied volatility skew that you have in here now remember you can go into uh the follow page and see these trades ahead of time all I did was click on Bob the trader that's to me here's the trade I did at 1016 the stock NOW is about 10 cents lower uh than where I put on the trade um the ivr was around 20 it's about the same right now I paid like I told you",
  "about the same right now I paid like I told you $6.2 and I asked you it's a new trade idea inspired by an emailer listen to my C my podcast for full details and hopefully that's what you did now I need you to listen to me one more time and please open Move transfer bring your account to tasty trade help us keep the lights on here also help us keep all this amazing content free to you and you know what you get to reach out to me if you want to bat tasty.com is my email address or really just",
