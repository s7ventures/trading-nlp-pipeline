this is the start Tony of a four-part series that we are doing every Monday for the next four weeks so for the next four weeks we are doing something called an earning season Playbook with earning season around the corner say we're going to drive into the key metrics needed to navigate these trades earnings trades can present unique opportunities but it's crucial to understand the factors that impact outcomes earnings trades by the way have in my opinion one of the the smallest amounts of edge that you're going to get they're interesting because they're binary they're interesting because they're immediate they're interesting because it's it's it's it's almost like um instant gratification if you're right but the other side to that is there is very little Edge even if you're working with a smaller account earnings trades can still be a viable strategy when risk is carefully managed by focusing on proper risk management you can position yourself to capitalize on Market moves while minimizing Downs potential downsides hey you know one thing I think that's interesting about earnings trads I just looked at Netflix man not much trading in there not a lot of trading the markets aren't as as tight of as I would thought too to be honest with you yeah I I did a Netflix trade I tried to sell calls in there this morning because I was a little it is a $700 stock I mean I understand that I sold the November 870 calls tried to took me forever to get them off so there's not not a lot there dude so when traded mechanically a few of the many advantages of earnings trades and these are the advantages most trade with high IV or high ivr they provide an opportunity for lots of occurrences and stocks you might not normally trade I think before we before we just go on here I also need to point out that they also have a downside and the downside is you have very little time to adjust usually your bed is made for you choosing the right duration is never easy because they're all mathematically accurate a you don't have time to adjust and B the outlier moves are hard to make back right that's fair yeah that's fair that's the downside so stocks exhibiting High implied volatility above 30 tend to experience earnings related changes in implied volatility exceeding 30% more often than typical trading days so what we're looking at here is which I think is interesting since we looked at six years worth of data and we basically said if you looked at Apple Microsoft Netflix Amazon and you looked at the average number notional IV the average you would see that it's about 35 when you look at it around earnings it's about 42 the difference there on a percentage basis is about 20% so if you're looking to know kind of like what are we talking about with height and volatility it doesn't matter whether it's Apple Microsoft Netflix Amazon on average throw them all together it's about 20% higher right 35 to 42 is 20% yep yep the standard deviation of implied volatility around earnings okay is this is where this is the big number it's essentially we're we're talking about plus or minus 8% in apple 8% in Microsoft 14% in Netflix remember that because that's tomorrow 10% in Amazon now the reason I say remember this because it's tomorrow is Netflix has the highest standard deviation IV change around earnings and when it does it does because for a reason it's the most risky so you look at Apple Microsoft Netflix and Amazon the riskiest of those four stocks is Netflix that's why it has the biggest range of implied volatility but the average number is 10.3 these are all really interesting numbers statistically we can create earnings with similar pop and a win percentage as a standard you know 45 day to expiration strangle since 2018 we sold 16 Delta strangles 45 days to expiration and then we sold 16 Delta strangles closest to earnings and held for a day in those same four stocks this is kind of a really cool research and so we looked at six years worth of research and if you look at the win rate overall selling 16 Delta strangles it's 72% which is a little bit less than than it would be for the indexes but you know there's more potential profit here actually apple and Netflix um dragged it down a little bit at theoretical and Microsoft and Amazon were higher than that but what's interesting here is the win rate only on earnings was virtually the same if you look and see which one is the worst of all all these in the last six years it's Netflix so the numbers don't lie really is what you're looking at here the numbers don't lie but Netflix has been hard to grind out you know surex is actually underperformed theoretical so you think more of a of I mean will this change your opinion on maybe more of a directional bias it's not going to change it does a little bit more of a directional bias in Netflix I'm inclined to be short in Netflix just because the Stock's so high but I guess my argument here is that if you if you were going to choose to sit one out because of low volume or low liquidity uh Netflix would probably be the one you sit out let's go to next slide understood we trade earnings small and and and Netflix earnings are Thursday not not tomorrow I think you you said tomorrow I thought it was tomorrow it's not tomorrow uh it's the 17th after the close oh sorry that's Thursday then something had earn tomorrow I don't remember what it is okay not a big deal um so the next thing we did is we we we looked at average price movement the same four stocks when you look at the change they switched the order here but when you look at the change around earnings it's plus or minus 7.2% when you look at the change without earnings it's 2.4 when you're thinking about just your earnings risk and earnings volatility it's it's almost 3x exactly that's pretty cool oh these are good numbers yeah um good numbers here's how the key mechanics differ from 45 day trades first is timing place your trade the day the day before earnings announcement to capture the pre- earn earnings volatility now when they say the day before you could do it two days before you could do it the day before you could do it the day of really matter there's there's nobody nobody knows for sure when you're going to sell the high tick and volatility each stock is very different really nobody know nobody knows for sure are you are you confident about that I happen to be very confident fair enough keep your size small to ensure that risk is consistent that's 100% ideally exit your position the morning after earnings I mean that's up to you I Tony and I like like to lock in profits or adjust trades the morning after earnings and use option strategies that benefit from high implied volatility pre-announcement and avoid concentrating too much risk in one earnings play to protect against unexpected outcomes I mean that's common
