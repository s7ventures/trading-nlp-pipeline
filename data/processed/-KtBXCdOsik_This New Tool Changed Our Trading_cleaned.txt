so this is a very exciting feature that we have is this you excited tting is this you excited because it's rare that I see you excited like this you're very animated this is well maybe three cups of coffee too animated now this this is good this is good news awesome show me what you got okay so on the platform if you look at Tasty tray.com backest this is uh not not on the platform correct on the on the sorry apologize on the on the website yep you got to go to the we yep you you can see this the our new back testing application that's available along with this little animated video here kind of explains what what's going on here now if you log into the platform itself and you go to my tastytrade.com which is the webon version this is so can I back you up for just a quick second so if I go to the web platform I just go to tasty trade yes webbased platform and put in my username and password that I would put in anywhere else before I'm going to have this already in there it's only in the web side of it I'm going to have this already in there and I can just click on back testing it'll bring me right here correct that's right awesome awesome so when you log in you'll get to like a dashboard here or something like this and you go over to trading and then you click over to back test back testing so so it's gonna have just to to back up again so it's going to have all my positions that I have in the desktop version ex exactly the same exact thing you can use webbased if you're not downloading it uh onto a computer if you're somewhere well overseas on vacation maybe enjoying yourself or something like that new computer that's right or you don't can't afford internet and you're at the library and you want to use a web- based platform you could do it that way right yeah I suppose yeah 100% 100% okay great and you can use all those back testing when when you log in the first time you log in you're going to have some compliance speak okay and then you're going to get you you click accept and then you open up to this page okay so the first thing that you're going to do if you want to back test and back testing is just seeing how well a position had worked over time okay or historically had worked over time and so let's click over here and say the the symbol that we want so here I'm going to just say spy now we have about 50 stocks right now have about 50 stocks and we're we're going to come out with about 200 in just a matter of just a couple weeks expensive for the data we're providing free right y 50 stocks just based on liquidity yeah some of the most liquid stocks you know the stocks that people were inquiring about the most then you can click down and you can choose the interval okay so what I would do on something like this is I would choose something that's in a relatively short time span okay just you can go all the way back to actually 2013 uh all the way at the bottom you can say all the way to 2013 the data that's available you can also choose different scenarios like you know we got one here energy sector collapse which was 2014 to 2016 uh The post-pandemic Surge 2020 to 2021 you can choose the tech sector Mania of 2020 to 2021 you know so you can choose different scenar that's nice or you can choose like the past and I'm just going to do the past three years then there's some different scenarios that you can choose here some different trades okay so if you want to choose just like I want to back test to see how well a short strangle had worked I'm going to go over here and I'm going to click short strangle then we queue up and we can see now also if if you want to we can just create our own strategy okay we can make adjustments to things so here I'm going to just say 30 Deltas 30 deltas and and this is choosing the strikes based on Deltas okay so this is the same as if you were in the trade platform you go down and you're selecting a strike and you look to see what that Delta was it's just an easy way to select strikes because you know what was a few years ago a $300 stock spy is now all of a sudden a $550 stock so Deltas is how we're choosing then you can choose your expirations now we tend to talk about 45 days till expiration by default it's 45 days but you can choose this and you change if you you can change it to 30 or or whatnot so you have a lot of flexibility here now you have some other options here you have your entry conditions and you have your exit conditions now these are the same this is the same tool that we're using in our our our research studies so you're basically going to be allowed to do what what we've been doing for the past 10 years so here you go entry conditions now you have some options here two two options one is you can either use the exact DTE so let's say right now if you look at spy okay I'm going to look at the options so if you're looking at uh 45 days we actually do have one at 45 days well yesterday we would have had one at 46 days till expiration well it wouldn't have come up with the trade yesterday because we only had one at 46 days till expiration we had another one at 67 days till expiration another one 39 days till expiration so here it would would have waited until today 45 days till expiration so here we just say Okay I want to use exact DT okay we can unclick this and we can get more number of observations how many would be the the maximum it basically would just be doing it every single day oh W so the idea behind that is you're just going to get a a nice distribution of of Trades you can see what was the the best performing the worst performing sure you can also say I want to limit the number of active trades okay so just like you would normally trade here I'm doing a strangle I want to see how well a strangle would have performed or had performed historically over the past three years October 11th 2021 to October um 10th 2024 so just like as of last week okay let's say you know money's unlimited so we're going to only do you know let's say one trade so that means we're only going to have one trade open and then when the next one closes when that trade closes then we'll open up another one okay and we can also just take that off and every 45 days or anytime 45 days is is in the window it would just create a new one okay now we have some exit conditions that we can choose let's just keep keep it all just you know just just uh the default which is nothing is selected okay so here it comes is up it's doing the transaction and it is showing the the the back test so that orange line is the back test the orange line is the p&l the profit and loss for this short strangle strategy here can see again the legs was selling one put at 30 Delta 45 days till expiration selling a call at 30 Delta 45 days till expiration over the past three years okay so this was a profit okay you can see the profit at the bottom now it did three years correct for three years got it okay now we we can also make adjustments to try to improve this and so this is like this is what we consider paper trading but paper trading 2024 not paper trading of 20 years ago you know get your results back instantaneous to see how well a strategy performed over time so here if you look you can see the Buy and Hold strategy it did underperformed the Buy and Hold strategy but yet buying hold strategy would have been holding up that money during the entire time sure sure sure you can see that the average profit and loss can you manage early on this thing absolutely you can see the Max draw down the return on Capital used now if you want to go down and look at the details you can see okay for this we ended up with it wasn't all that great 55% of the trades were profit profitable so we had 18 trades 10 were profitable eight with losses uh you can see the average return per trade you can see the average premium collected over the past three years you can see the premium capture rate that means how much money we tended to keep after everything said and done and this does include the fees and you can see the fees here were $111 okay we can also look at the logs and this is very this is very useful because you can see okay on how were the fees $111 well that that would be the you get $1 of course and then you also have your OCC fees you have your clearing fees you have all those other how many contracts you doing what do we say here did we say number one that would been one and then you have a buy and a sell well that would be just one and then you had two trades so you have the fees over threeyear period yes oh got it okay sorry yeah over yeah over the entire three-year period this is not right right so it's every 45 days minus whatever manager what okay it's all the continual roles absolutely got it okay now if you want to look at what happened okay October 12th 2021 this is the first trade and we closed it out why did we close it out well it was actually exercise so it it looked like it had gone through either the call or the put here and so we got exercise that position this one here expired and it was a it was a profit but the first one was a loss we had some losses here a big loss here of 36% return on on investment and you can just look down and you can see what the fees were the the premiums were then you go over here and we can look at the orders okay so here's another thing that's that's interesting on this we're looking at it on the most liquid part of the day which is at 2:45 that is the transaction time so we're not looking at the close we're looking at the bid offer spread and so all these trades would be done at 245 you can see what the the credit was okay the first one we did it at 993 and we took it off for this debit okay and you can look down and you can see all the the orders you can see the transactions too what exactly went on you can also download each one of these pages so if you're kind of a ner you get really granular here you could then you could take that and put it into an Excel spreadsheet if you wanted to absolutely cuz some people have like really particular like what they want to do they want to Overlay it with some technical analysis you want to see when the stock hit your number if you put on this strategy or you want to see if a stock had a you know a 1% move in any one day you can do all that you put on this strategy yeah it's very cool you do all that this shows you the daily settlement so this is just going to show you every single day going back those three years and it's showing you the p&l for each particular day here it's basically just showing okay 4% of the the total has been done and you can see more and you can you can show the Thousand other days within this this this test now let's go back and let's let's just make some modifications to this this particular trade so I went back and I just said uh select go back to the the previous new back test so here we can say let's then exit at 21 days till expiration why do you do that well we tended to show that historically once you get close expiration your gamma risk all of a sudden increases your Theta Decay increases significantly but your gamma risk starts increasing so we say it tends to be you know at about 21 days till expiration calendar days is when we kind of like to manage as kind of a ballpark we can also say okay let's take profits at a specific premium level we can say let's add a stop loss here or we can also say let's just exit at two days into the trade and we can do that here I'm going to just say 21 days profit is it pulling the prices at the end of the day yes at 245 at 245 yeah at 245 is when it's it's it's it's assuming that you're exiting these trades so it's not doing this on the close it's doing this at 245 which is the most liquid part of the day so then we can run this back test with those adjustments and we can see how well it did in this particular you know in managing it it looked like it didn't do as well but this is always going to vary based on on what you're doing what your expectations are so if you want to I I thought I saw a feature in there when I was playing around with it that and you may have mentioned it for me if if you did sure where you can close that order and open another one when the when the parameters hit right so if you want to continually have this type of strategy on like let's say you're managing at 25 or 35 or 50% or some number date and time and put on another on AB exact moment with new strikes or the same strikes but they would be same Delta but they would be new strikes obviously because time has gone by or go out to a different month is that correct or not 100% so here this is what you do for something like that okay you want to do this set let's just change these uh let's just change this up a little bit let's you can get you can get really crazy in you get a little bit intricate as opposed to just looking at what a strangle is going to do over 45 days absolutely you know if you think that the Russell for example you think the Russell is is going to go off and is just going to have this huge increase in in in things or you think that there's going to be some huge V SP Spike because of things we can get granular in this we can look to see what how a particular strategy performed during your type of Market scenario that you're either expecting and then you can make an assumption okay this is how it performed in the past during during the uh let's say uh during the in in the bare Market okay you can see how well this strategy worked on something like that we don't have yeah yeah yeah we that just doesn't happen at all not allow so here you let's just say I only want to do this every until there's up to five trades and then I don't want to put on anymore because you know money's limited and and that's kind of realistic okay so then you can just run this run this scenario during that environment okay in this strategy it it outperformed a buy and hold you of course you know a Buy and Hold would have lost money during a during a decrease in the overall Market but then there's things that you can do I mean obviously if you think the Market's going to decline you're not going to be selling a strangle you would maybe just sell a call so let's see how well that would work during that type of environment and see how well we can we can make modifications to the the profit and loss and the adjustments of the strategies so you get your almost instantaneous results here this is this is back testing 2024 is this the most trading is this the most advanced back testing platform exists it is I believe the most advanced free back testing application that's on the market right now has to be the newest technology matter what I'd like to think so and it's free it's it's free as long as you have an account you sign up for an account
