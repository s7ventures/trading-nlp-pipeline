avoiding pattern day trading how do you avoid pattern day trading Tony Batista have more than $25,000 in your account or trade futures or Futures options fut Futures options yeah 100% or trade with one day to go or trade one day to go yeah so there are a couple ways to avoid pattern day trading rules if you have less than $25,000 and if you want to trade zero DTS because this is our zero DT piece a you can trade the es options or the mees options they have no pattern day trading rules different regulatory body B um well obviously you get over $25,000 um and uh C there you go one trade with one day to go yep yep so what we're going to do for this study well I'll read this to you and then we'll explain zero DT option markets very popular so far research has found that selling zero DT at Market open was very profitable but this can run a foul of pattern day trading rules because you're only allowed three round turns um and that can in one week and that can run out really quickly MH so do we gain or lose that's SPX options included too yes yes yes so do we gain or lose if we instead sell the one DT like the night before and cover at the next opening so it's not a round trip in the day is what you're avoing sell it like sell tonight yep buy it back tomorrow morning yep winner or loser I don't know I'm goingon to say loser just because of the magnitude of the moves of the opening okay Tony says probably a small Loser yeah um I don't think it's GNA be much of anything win or lose because I've done this a bunch of times and I haven't made or lost very much money let's go next slide so we did a study think the win ratio is going to be real well let me put it to you that way so like I don't think we're gonna do two years a study for two years um we're going to sell options on the close we're going to buy them back the next morning okay and we're going to look at the pnl from these positions and we are going to um we're not going to do it on Friday to Monday okay so just Monday Tuesday Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday Thursday Thursday Friday right that's it no Friday Monday all trades were assumed to exercise at Mid price that means close at Mid price and buying power controlling the long strikes are still needed that's up to you if you want to buy the wings whatever okay let's go to the next slide so here's the here's the the here's what we got this is our evidence today so we're going to do this with 40 Delta strangles 30 Delta strangles and 20 Delta strangles sell them the night before for every single day for 2 years buy them back the next morning straddles 68% 40 Delta strangles 67% 30 Delta strangles 69% and 20 Delta strangles 71% the win percentage didn't really matter what you did very interesting yeah the net pnl for the overnight trade that did matter the bigger you sold kind of the more money you made so the straddles the 40 Delta strangles made about double of what the 30 Delta and the 20 Delta strangles made and you and the amount of risk you took was about that's the sear was about the same all along so the reality of this study says essentially you want to sell something tonight sell a big sell a straddle or a big strangle and that's how you're going to do the best MoneyWise don't sell the cheap stuff yeah because you can you don't need like a bird poop like an elephant that's right makes sense we'll do this tonight Thursday for Friday counts here okay let's go to the next slide so selling zero DT premium is generally successful over the past two years provided the winners were managed aggressively that means on the opening essentially but PDD pattern day trading rules make it almost impossible to place and manage zero DTE trades without incurring additional account restrictions if you have less than 25,000 if you have over 25,000 none of this matters PDD can be skirted by selling the 1dt options on the previous close and then manage them the next morning holding these short positions overnight was net profitable but incurred an occasional large loss when the overnight prices made dramatic moves ironically the rules intended to protect retail in investors may push those um looking to trade zero DT trades into more risk because you got to take overnight risk right it's kind of crazy that's the disingenuous portion of those archaic and idiotic rules hopefully that rule will get changed hopefully that rule will be changed um but stay small and give it a shot if you want good job good job out of you good job by the team we're GNA take better results than I would have thought we'll do it tonight good job out of you we'll take a quick 90c break we'll come back we got more tasty Live sign of what comes up next that's right the moment you've been waiting for Scott sherid and tasty trade World Headquarters imly following these messages from our sponsors
