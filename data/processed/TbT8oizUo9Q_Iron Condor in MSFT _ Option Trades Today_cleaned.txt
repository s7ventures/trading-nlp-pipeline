welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the bat batist and I have not one but two trade ideas for you today on this scary day in the market it's Halloween and the market is giving us a big scare let's see what's going on before we look at those two trades Ean S&P is down 90 handles they're just off of their lows of down a 100 that's over a 1 and a half% move so far and it's early in the morning NASDAQ down 445 that's your leader to the clubhouse to the downside well over 2% to 20,990 Russell down 26 and the Dow down 426 down 1% volatility up a118 that's a 6% move and a number we haven't seen in quite some time 2050 if you notice here we got up to around 2050 back on October uh 8th we also got up this volatility on September 6th volatility is certainly percolating it's percolated over the last couple of days we talked about that on this podcast on Tuesday just 48 hours ago how volatility was expanding and the market was continuing to go higher a little bit weird on that until you got these two down days yesterday and now uh today bonds are down 22 ticks uh no flight to Quality here uh well maybe there is a big flight to Quality as bonds go lower rates go higher usually people looking to buy bonds to keep uh uh their their risk in the equity Market to a minimum go to the flight of quality of bonds uh buy bonds rates would go lower rates are going higher right now don't look like any rate cut on my scoreboard right now and Bitcoin after getting to 73,0 71 and change oil's the big mover probably the only mover to the upside uh that we look to trade if you're not looking at volatility it's up one and a half% a dollar eight or so to $696 okay I told you I have uh not one but two trades today uh the first one I'll give you is the easy one Microsoft Microsoft msft a post earnings trade Microsoft down $24 today uh on earnings actually up uh pre-market right after the earnings came out sold off uh significantly down $24 and change as the day has worn on today here you see Microsoft down here obviously no earnings because they came out uh today volatility was actually uh in Microsoft the ivx 5day change was unchanged uh when I put this trade on not too long ago the ivy rank is 46 and change you'll notice it got down to around $46 in change which that's about a dollar uh or so lower than where it is right now and up to 416 I'm going to do a defined risk trade in Microsoft uh since the volatility is still elevated you're basically getting pre market rank IV rank when it's post earnings already so like you know it's like it's like we're getting the the volatility expansion of earnings after earnings so I'm going to do a Define RIS tra here because it is a $400 stock and would use a lot of buying power if you weren't using defined risk trades I'm going to go pretty classic here uh I'm going to go down to the 365 puts that's just about the 15ish Delta let me get rid of the open interest here because the open interest as you can see is huge let's go to open interest and change it to Delta since I have probability of being in the money you know you can see the in the money probability and the Delta are basically the same uh we typically say it's one or two Delta difference it's just one Delta difference at this moment anyway I'm looking to sell the 365 puts and I'm also looking to sell the 455 calls that is a straight Delta play they both have around 13 or 14 Deltas uh on on this trade the 13 on both of them right now you're going to see a little bit of change on the wings that I buy but you can see here there's a $44,000 trade okay for for my account but I want to define the risk here do something a little bit different uh go a little bit wider I'm actually going to go $15 wide for those playing at home I'm going to go down to the 340 put that's $15 wide and I'm going to go up to the $470 call which is $115 wide um I was able to do this at 296 uh when I placed the order was about 2 cents under mid price so maybe you can get 297 um if you have the same experience that I do that change your changes your buying power to $2,200 uh instead of being completely delta neutral it gives you maybe uh you know two long delas but as you can see the short strikes are the same look at the uh win on the upside meaning look at this this dotted line This dotted line is the standard deviation to the upside we're outside that because this green line shows you our break even and we're outside of it to the downside there is 50 days to expiration I do like to go closest to 45 days with the um uh monthly options so these options would be the ones that I'm trading these are the weekly options wouldn't be looking to do that and with 15 days into November that's way too close for me this trade has uh $6 a day in Theta Decay for the $2,200 that I have at risk it has a 76% Pop I like to have probably a profit over 65% this certainly fits that bill uh this is a trade that is uh wants the stock to stay inside its expected range you can see here that the expected range is just under $30 in this elevated IV and Ivy rank that we have here uh your break evens are under 265 and over 455 if you notice here 455 uh is just off of the highs and 365 uh is brings you back to uh January of this year so for me this is a a post earnings trade with volatility that's still reflecting because of what's going on the market and everywhere else it's still reflecting High implied volatility that's my iron Condor defined risk trade using relatively small buying power from my account again your account might be different SPX well if volatility is expanding in the overall market then it's certainly expanding in SPX because SPX is uh the market and this may only be day one but I'm going to take a little bit of a flyer in SPX on this day one because it may be day one but you'll notice look how many days of the market we've taken out already we've taken out uh we're back to levels we haven't seen uh since a month ago or so so I'm going to look at my patent pending omnidirectional broken wing butterfly but I'm skewing it a little bit more because These Wings Are bid meaning volatility as I showed you once uh earlier when we did the show when we started this podcast is at a level we have not seen for many uh we have seen a few times but we haven't seen that often I'm going to look to take advantage of that by going a little bit wider on this SPX trade that I normally do let me explain to you what I'm talking about just like I talked about Microsoft we like to go uh around 45 days I like to use the monthly options again in SPX there's there's liquidity everywhere you can go to whatever month you like I like to go to December uh am options 49 days close to 45 days I'm going to go in those I'm going to go down to you know broker wing butterfly is buying uh one spread and selling another spread typically twice as wide as the spread you're buying I'll show you on the screen so you don't have to follow along with just uh my voice here I'm going to go down I like to go down to around the 15ish Delta again that standard uh deviation so I'm going to go all the way down to the 5300 puts uh you'll notice here that they have a 17 Delta when I put this on even the S&S were only down around 80 so you can be able to do this better than I did it so I'm buying the 5300 puts I'm going $50 wide and I'm going to sell one of the 52 50 puts now I said a broken wing butterfly is just buying one spread and selling another spread now typically what I do is I sell the body here again so I'm going to make this two contracts so now I have already bought the 5,300 puts or at least place the order to buy the 5300 puts sold one of the 5200 puts now I'm going to sell another spread I'm going to sell the 5250 puts one time that's how we get 1 by two that would be just a classic ratio spread I said we go twice the width we went $50 wide here so we're going to go down to $100 wide so you normally would buy the 50 150 and these spreads usually trade with this amount of time around $3.15 $3 uh in that range I'm going to take on a little bit more risk here I'm going to go another and you'll notice here that the buying power is 46 $ 44700 this pop is 89% this state of decay is $436 omnidirectional slightly bullish one long Delta Max profit $5,350 $535 why because you're selling this spread for $35 if the stock were to close again cash settled there is no um uh uh stock involved here so it's all cash settled so you don't have to come up with the money at expiration if the stock were to close under 5250 or right at 5250 you don't have to worry about whether you're going to be exercise or signed there is none of that this is all cash settled but this spread that you're long would be worth $5 ,000 plus the $35 that you might have sold this for like I just said I'm going to take on a little bit more risk so I'm going to move this 5150 put down another $50 to 5,100 what is that going to do that's going to increase my credit that I received from around $310 15 or $35 increase it by another $3 to $620 full disclosure on this trade it has about an 89 uh percent pop it's $8 of th in Theta Decay this would be a way to keep your your contract size the same but in not increase your units but increase your risk by buying power the buying power obviously goes up to $9,300 that's is a large trade for anybody's account my own account included so you have to watch your size if $10,000 or just under is too much buying power for you then I would go down to the one that I previously showed you with using the 5150 put if you want some money to have at risk if you're a little bit more bullish than what the market is showing you here today then maybe this is a spread that you would like to put on again I'm putting this on right here full disclosure as I said just a moment ago if you go to the follow page you can notice that you can do this spread significantly better than me I'll put up my SPX here for you just so you can see I get to see I think you get to see about a month of these trades or the 30 past trades uh that I've done in in SPX it's one or the other I think it's the last month or month and a half of trades or the last uh 30 trades or something like that but anyway you can see what I did here look how fast this spread moves cuz I did it at 9:33 when SPX uh was Trad at 5738 it had an ivy rank of 34 look at what's happened to The Ivy rank it's expanded even more which means this spread is going to trade even fatter for you I got filled at 590 and 605 even though the spread even though SP SPX only moved $2 this move by 15 that's a product of volatility expanding and volatility expanding right now maybe you want to wait on this trade and see if volatility collapses a little bit 91% pop when I put the trade on you'll notice that that probability profit has changed to 89 look at this it's up at 650 I have an order in at 645 to sell it uh again so we'll see if we have that uh if I get filled I will definitely uh post that for you after this podcast again I did about half my size that I normally do so for you Traders out there if you're only a one lot Trader in SPX maybe this is not the spread for you maybe you should go back down to that you know risk uh two to make one kind of trade if you have more buying power or maybe you have uh uh you've been rolling down a lot of calls like if you notice uh for me in my portfolio I'm reducing Delta all over the place in all of my trades uh in Apple today which I had a little bit of uh short Delta in I rolled down my calls to keep my short Delta in apple a Goldman Sachs that was a trade that we just put on uh in this podcast I believe on Tuesday I rolled down my calls to keep my Deltas uh in line Microsoft uh I rolled uh that that that was the um spread that we just did I showed you little to no volatility change after earnings so I'm doing a post earnings uh $15 wide iron Condor again you can see these trades before you even get the podcast um if you have a tasty trade account and look at the follow page those are my two SPX trades I just did I showed you wings are Bid I did half my normal size omnidirectional slightly bullish trade in SPX and then TSM um I'm rolling down the untested uh untested side mu I'm rolling down the untested side why am I telling you this or showing you all this because I'm losing my long Deltas in these other products by rolling down the untested side and replacing that with the SPX trade that does have long Delta remember SPX is 10 times the size of spy so it's a very big product be careful out there ladies and gentlemen and don't scare yourself with these trades but I know one thing that won't scare you is to bring your account to tasty trade open Move
