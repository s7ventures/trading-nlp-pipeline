your return in 2020 was 160% so what happened all of a sudden that was you know [Music] uh hi everybody we're back it's another rising star show today and I'm excited Michael in the house thanks so much for coming out Tom appreciate it thanks for having me in the new studi they're awesome oh great well you haven't been out here before no no but as we were just talking I remember that um we met um I don't remember how many years ago it was but it was before the pandemic oh yeah probably eight8 or nine years ago probably eight or n years I actually think I don't remember wow um I had thrown a popup dinner at Washington DC was giving a speech at U CIA and I threw a pop-up dinner that night and you were one of the ones that that won the the invite the email I didn't even realize it also until like 3 seconds ago yeah so there so that's awesome um well thank you for coming in and uh looking forward to it uh looking forward to hearing your story now I you know what struck me is when you first came in you said um that you were teaching at Georgetown and I was like okay I remember having somebody at dinner that we I was talking to that was teaching class at Georgetown and so I can't believe it's uh one in the same so um you started watching tasty in 2012 yeah so it's been a 12 year relationship well we're like family right in a way yeah you share a lot more about your lives than I have with mine I guess yeah well it's but it's cool and I I love the the you know all that history there so you know plenty about us um to give everybody a little background because I'm not sure what's popping up on their screen but um civil engineering degree from Virginia Tech Master's in finance from Georgetown um and one of the key that they have marked for me is that you are the proud owner of a number Cherry pin I am well wore wore it here today back when I think I have a cherry pin on right now yes uh nice oh and opening account that was one of the the things that you got back then there you go and you wear proudly I like it and before we get into kind of you know some of your results and some of your stuff I'm I'm really fascinated by so you're an engineer MH you you also you're an entrepreneur yeah you and and you're also teach at two un ities Virginia Tech in in Georgetown correct so you're you're kind of like a techie engineer and then you're also you've got all this other entrepreneur stuff going on in addition to you know you're trading um how much time do you spend watching markets uh I was I was telling uh some of the the team out there uh this morning I I'll have the show on live show on almost every day uh for the first 3 or 4 hours um there's always a screen that I have up that has my account on there just to watch uh nice yeah we can get into the trading a little later you know I don't trade all that actively decently so but um it's it's an awareness thing for me uh it has so much context in a lot of the work I do outside of trading so so what does that mean I mean explain I'll go on a little tangent but I'll answer your question that sure in the uh one of the graduate courses it's a foundations of Finance I mean npv you know formula basic let's talk about time value of money okay um and we have a discussion about well what what sets the time value interest rates you know where are they what do they come from how are they set you know who who determines them what's the the pull them uh and we probably wouldn't surprise you but the vast majority of of students you know don't have that context to the bond market and have never traded a bond or note and don't know what any of the spreads are and you know it's the interest rates is something the bank sets and uh you know get into the next question of well where rate's going and well I don't I don't know well actually yeah there's an entire Market that's do you tell do you tell your students that you trade the markets yeah we get there you you get there yeah okay because I think it probably I I I wish I had professors that well I don't know how easy would have been to trade back then but I kind of feel like I wish professors would trade and then I wish they would tell the students that they trade because that kind of that that it means a lot lot more I actually true story in in an underr class I actually had a student come up and asked if I've ever heard of tasty trade and tasty live he he was a watcher and and was just started traing when we started talking about options it like peaked his you he's like wait I I know that let me come talk to you about it so yeah they're out there but uh the context it just you have to um try to put it in perspective of of whatever environment we're in and especially in real estate which is a lot of the focus of what those Master's classes are on and it provides that you know yeah the only problem with real estate that the only there's many problems well yeah yeah I guess as somebody who's trying to sell a building right now sure but um one of the great things about trading for me is that that it's it's actually something that that it's actionable because of the liquidity in the markets and real estate as as much fun as it sounds like on paper sometimes it's not actionable because there is no liquidity yeah so it's you know correct you could have the you you could have the best building in the city but if you can't transact doesn't matter you're I mean you're so dependent on on you know unlisted financial markets well even non-listed markets they they're regardless of what what's happening there's a bid and an offer and there's some Market somewhere could be wide but there's a market well or or or it could be very low and unattractive it could be high but there's a market there's not always a market in everything else and so the the con concept of liquidity is is quite foreign to um to a lot of people when they think about taking risk and that's one of the things I I just love to hammer home you know um to give to providing context in in your teaching do you think that trading has played a a similar role in you know the entrepreneurial Ventures that you have and in the engineering side of the business that you're you know you're principal in absolutely um trading has taught uh I don't want to call instant decisions but instant decisions you know like you have to make uh with the information you have with the risk you're willing to take on you know do you get in a position or not um that is every day of owning and running a business assessing risk and making quick decisions is something that I preach non-stop but sometimes people have a hard time like hearing that and actually wondering how they're going to apply that yeah there's I mean there's decision Paralysis on so many things in life you can't have that in running a business doesn't mean you're always making the right decision no you don't have to always make the right decision you just have to make a decision correct there's nothing worse than not making a decision but I don't care if you're right just make the damn decision just just pick pick a away and and figure it out later you you'd be surprised but you're going to be right a majority of the time because that's just the way everything works the the uh the favors go to those who make the quickest decisions and for whatever reason it just works out that way um so let's get into trading yeah when did you actually start trading uh I opened first account when tasty works with the time now tasty trade uh had you done anything before 200 yeah I I um opened my first stock brokerage with with Fidelity when I turned 18 okay to invest I mean I wasn't it was never a day trade never uh you know try to speculate um there were no I didn't do options at that time what did you do did just buy stocks just buy stocks I mean that was back when you paid uh like $10 a trading commission commission every time just to enter and exit position and yeah couldn't couldn't do much with that um but it was just to to get in uh you my my dad was in finance uh so I was aware of it um when's your dad due uh now long since retired but um was in higher education Finance got it so he was a professor no uh on the administrative side he has PhD but he was administrative Side Run uh College finances um Cornell some Pennsylvania schools got it so you were Finance yeah my dad was a um uh didn't believe in stocks so it's very hard for me to make the transition because he's like had to relearn yeah smart guy but uh not didn't believe in the stock market um the so your first Venture was just kind of traditional passive buy few shares here or there yeah put put in the mutual fund the the you know set it and forget it stuff set it and forget it go to sleep for 45 50 years and hope when you wake up it's going to be significantly higher yeah still have that account still have the accounts it's higher you know through no efforts of my own um but uh you you said at some point one of your your segments long ago that like you know you don't know how you can sleep at night with that because you know you don't know what risk has on yeah actually that that doesn't bother me sleeping at night with a passive account doesn't it I'm not I don't worry about that from a risk perspective I worry about that from a from a knowhow perspective I worry about that there's no KN there is no noow exactly I worry about that from from what's going to happen in you know in 20 years when you're when you know just as much as you know today and you know you haven't figured anything out you know you haven't experienced anything that's what I worry about yeah um so you start watching tasty in 2012 did you start trading options then or you waited uh I I'll say I paper traded um I had I had the theory in my head CU I was teaching at the time okay my first introduction options was actually academically uh when I was going through my mattress program okay they had a professor who we had to draw out the the option payoff diagrams by hand and understand how these things got put together uh and and something it just kind of clicked with something something yeah wait a minute I can I can quantify the risk and I can uh hedge it in the light so it's not financially hedged but I can I can compartmentalize it um and so then I said all right let me let me start to see what's going on and uh through a front of a friend I was actually on a golf course of all places where I when I first heard the the name tasty trade and uh at the you know the live show at the time and started watching it and you and Tony and figuring out what all that chaos was about but eventually it made sense once you once you got a few episodes and yeah yeah it wasn't it's not something you just turn on and go okay I'll just watch this for the rest of my life yeah so far we're in yeah that's great and um so you're messing around you're paper trading and you're kind of figuring it out kind of and you opened one of the first tasty trade accounts was that the first time you ventured into listed options no so I had cuz I had the Fidelity account for forever um I had got approved on Fidelity to to go through their options and uh not to for those with vality accounts I'm sure they're they're quite happy there but it was a process uh don't don't even don't even get me started yeah there's multiple levels well they don't love me so it's okay I'm good don't worry about it then uh I I traded a couple options at the Fidelity account with what limited Authority and permissions I was allowed to do uh and it kind of made sense um but you know it was a it was not easy to do there was some friction on uh the execution did it bother you that you're restricted from C doing certain things or you didn't realize at the time no it I I very much realize it it it confused me while the restrictions were there um yeah you had to interview to to trade your own money in a way yeah of course um and I'm sure you can make an argument from a firm perspective but we won't go down that rabbit hole no no sure uh and that's when uh you you were launching again tasty works the trading platform at the time and yeah said yeah this is this I like what I hear and this uh this is built by people who are going to click the button so I'll give it a try and and have it look back perfect do you remember what you first did when you started out trading I think that was like that was 2017 mhm yeah open the account and I didn't do anything let left the money sit there for for you know probably a week or two okay uh yeah it's it's one of the things when you get the new car you don't drive it right away yeah sure well you want to smell it for a while you got to see how it goes yeah just admire it yeah uh and then it was um um trying to figure out a plan right like $2,000 account there's not a lot you can do you can't do trade of and can't you can't have 30 positions on um and it really teaches you uh kind of a a perspective on where and how to deploy Capital uh which you you talk about a lot um to size a position with the risk you're willing to take on you want a winner obviously but sure again and you're I'm trying to figure out a way to learn how to win not not necessarily always make the money right away that was kind of part of the whole Genesis of tasty was you know before we can really focus on wealth creation we need to focus on teaching people and showing people that you know how how you can actually have probabilities and in finance that are real um that are you know theoretical that are practical but that are not you know not completely just made up like well and you you know certainly more than I most people hear derivatives and it's an instant association with gambling or or highrisk weapons of mass destruction as Warren Buffett once said sure it's a pretty famous quote Yeah uh and it it comes from misunderstanding right they very much can be if if someone's just going in and buying or selling a position that that they're outsized to do but but but that's that is the nature of Leverage and you know and risk and you know if you want an opportunity to have a high probability of success if you want an opportunity to have um to have some you know asymmetrical upside you're going to have to take some risk that's just nature so so I kind of feel like you're one of those weird case studies time I've heard that what not the first time I've heard that your wife tell you that to uh many times okay I've been now that bro um I I feel like you're one of those studies though in that you had lots of different reasons to trade M it wasn't necessarily about like you're not going to open a very small Tasty Bite accounts and think you weren't thinking at the time I'm going to turn this into you know $10 million still don't think that right you're thinking I'm going to teach myself how to win and I'm going to teach myself about a little bit about kind of I'm I'm going to gain some knowhow about financial markets I'm going to learn about some of the in intricacies of trading and strategies and I can use all this in my businesses and my risk-taking my teaching all that kind of stuff yeah cuz the first time I met you had to be right around when you opened tasty works or just just after and um and you were trading mhm and I mean I didn't ask you any questions at the time you know but it's just like um I remember now asking you you know or you telling me that you were using some of the stuff that I can't remember if you asked me a question can I use some of the stuff in class because we have a lot of professors and or that you were using some of the stuff that we were doing in class which I was like that's awesome you know because I want professors to change kind of the curriculum and bring It Forward a few decades decades 30 40 years yeah 30 40 years exactly and so I was so happy that you were doing that and and I kind of remember that you know conversation I've had that with a bunch of professors all over and it's cool yeah so let's talk about the progression so the first couple of years are you like you know just kind of Treading Water uh yeah uh I mean first year first year of a year I think I pretty much ended flat like maybe maybe $100 down yeah which you know $2,000 account it's a it's a dip but um I was just all defin risk I'm pretty sure in the first year yeah could couldn't afford anything yeah you know I think maybe the affordable undefined position at the time would have been like Snapchat when it was you know like a $8 stock or something like you sell you're selling the $7 put when $8 yeah yeah it wasn't wasn't the best decisions but uh you know feeling out how uh to manage the position right and that's something that that really uh takes time to learn that process of how to properly make oh yeah because you know anybody can manage a winner it's the losers that that where you start to get it's the challenge yeah um and you know if if nothing that early the early years uh teaches you to be humble pretty quickly uh you don't know anything when the bell goes off it makes you second second guess your Genius you know like like you've been told your whole life you know you go through your your undergraduate degree your graduate degree you're it's humbling pretty quick hey my kid's a genius and then all of a sudden you get humble by the Marcus when you're like I guess I don't really know anything Market doesn't care what your position is that's right doesn't care how smart you are it doesn't care about your phds it'll go right through yeah exactly uh and so so just learning to operate that environment you know it's a it's a big box that you're you're playing in hell yeah absolutely so so you kind of for two or three years you I don't know you go sideways spin your wheels you know like learning uh learning grinding it up couple wins couple losses um you know trying to learn from the losses what what went wrong did I not manage it correctly uh did the market just go through me which happens uh yeah was it too big a risk for for what I put on or did I just have the wrong position on you know I don't I don't know that there was a theme there it was just trying to figure I hope you teach your students that sometimes the stocks win yeah oh yeah but you have to right right um you could have the absolute best position on and there's nothing you can do about it like you should have been right which you weren't you know probabilities are what they are and 5% happens 5% of the you could be playing poker and have two Aces you know and both lost that hand yes exactly lost that hand many times right yeah so um sitting on 20 to blackjack table yeah exactly sitting on 21 and you push you know and it's like how com so let's start getting into a little bit of the um you know when you started to turn the corner yeah like did some did a bell go off did you figure it out no it was Comfort um you started I started to understand where and how uh I was taking on risk and what that meant um in the position you know you see the buying power reduction which of course is is quantification of it but what does it actually mean how does that fluctuate you mostly trading um equities or indexes or what uh yeah no no Futures uh no Futures options at that time it was just would have been listed uh single stocks or or ETFs are you trading Futures and Futures options now yeah okay good yeah when you first like now we're up to like 2020 you've been doing this for like let's say 3 years um you're you're still you have a small account you're just you're you're you're learning M you've got you now you're three years in it's like it's like a graduate degree yeah you know longer um and uh and you're not being rewarded you're not being rewarded monetarily but you're being rewarded something else yeah I mean I think I'm up probably a couple hundred bucks maybe $1 thousand doll I for for the exact numbers but um yeah I've learned a process right uh your your analogy there to a graduate program it feels about right like you don't remember every class and every lecture but but you know you've learned something along the way and uh things are easier you start to know what position what strategy you want to use environment and when you win when you win it doesn't matter like even to this day for me whether it's like it could be a $100,000 win it can be a $1,000 win it can be a $100 win it's a win it's a win I don't don't really care so freaking win and and winning is part of this game it's like you have to have wins MH yeah you have to keep reinforcing absolutely all right so what happened in 2020 where your your return in 2020 was 160% so what happened all of a sudden um that was you know uh the world changed um but in a financial Market the right place at the right time I mean 2020 was the pandemic yeah so you were home you know I I had three under the belt so I'll say there weren't really any first dat Jitters right I wasn't coming in um so watching uh IV Spike across the market um I'll say knowing for whatever that means no one knows anything but anticipating that as with every other time in the market history it's it's overstated being able to act on that right that's the three years of of trading practice to go all right to deploy the tools that you have in your tool belt um and and the returns came in uh you know great on a percentage Bas still what strategies were you into them like what were you doing in 2020 uh probably just wide iron Condors at that point um again taking advantage of that the just absolute massive spike in volatility across the market um not being comfortable to go undefined in those okay I was probably trading undefined at that time yeah but with such high IV going okay you know I don't know what I don't know here and this is when you know the train comes out of out of the left side and takes it all out so I'll put the the guard rails back on a little bit for my own safety I like um but still you know wide enough that was able to to reduce some of the friction of of the downside of definer strategies and then so we move forward into 2021 and in 2021 you make half your return is half as much but it's still 82% instead of 160 60 is not realistic not realistic yeah by the next year 82 882 is not really realistic either but still you did it we we lived in I I yeah we did we did and and that's where throughout that year I started taking those guardrails off went more undefined risk okay and so what percentage were you defined and undefined prior to that I'd say probably 90% defined okay and what about 2021 transitioning through the pandemic I probably came into 50/50 and and now maybe are in the 6040 defin being the bigger part there got it and again it's just is that the primary change or was there something else that year 2021 uh no that's primary change and then you know an accommodating Market um again I can't overstate yeah the after the whole mem stock thing in 2021 stayed away from that yeah well that's good but I mean after that there was a volatility contraction kind of for the rest of the year yeah so it's a pretty good year and then we fast forward to 2022 mhm but 2022 you lost money lost money it's good to have a losing year I think what happened it got too big um oh the classic well um I got too big in that I went into the Futures market and the Futures Market won and you didn't realize how big those products were yeah yeah um I stand by it as an important lesson to have learned no one likes losing year but what Futures Market in particular yes oh yes yeah just uh you know I I honestly think I sold the I bought back the down tick uh in a falling Market to help to to you know cancel the crash and it went up after I sold oh thank you very much you're welcome uh emotionally that's what it feels like for sure U but that's all do you know how many Traders think they sold the bottom like everybody multiple times it's a fishing story we'll never know s the bottom Bo somebody has to right of course everybody does everybody's watched the same movie but that year you finished down 42% yeah so you know up 162 up 82 down 42 did that did it shake you or was it just like hey you know what this happens um both really uh it it was all right what happened and you can pinpoint CU you had to be pretty cocky after being up 250% the prior two years um I I'll be honest I wasn't cuz the Market's humbling right you have enough losers where even when you think you're right and and you're wrong how often are you trading that in by 2022 uh by 2022 probably two three times a week pretty light you yeah that's not that much don't have a lot of capital to trade with at the time um so a lot of it's watching and going okay do I have to manage this or no I'm just going to sit and see see how this uh did you get it discouraged at all in 2022 oh absolutely you know anytime you get discouraged at a losing trade a losing air uh but you know take take a step back and analyze where did the loss come from was it thematically an issue that I just had all the wrong positions on or no it turns out it's you know five or 10 positions that are just too big and when they down draft they downdraft you know there's nothing else you can do and so you you re everything you were teaching at the time come to question you're like uh probably right there there's that moment where you go look like I thought I had this under control again not not not in a calculate but I thought there's a strategy I'm trying to follow well 2022 was also a pretty decent Siz selloff yeah and March is where most of the losses came from in in a strange way given your your age and given when you kind you had never seen like there hasn't been a lot of bare barket no 2023 you make a comeback and you're up 25% for the year mhm and you um it's a bounceback year MH um anything changed in 20123 I mean obviously the market rallied because you seem to be better when the market rallies um I'm I generally trade pretty Market neutral uh I'll inadvertently have some positive Delta on but we're talking plus 10 yeah I mean it it it tend to fluctuate around on pretty neutral yeah and are you um your ratio of defined to undefined risk kind of similar uh now I'm probably no 2023 oh yeah uh pretty similar okay the difference was stick to what I know don't don't play in the big markets so you didn't do anything different in 2023 except you stayed away from some of the Futures trades that a little bigger I I got out of my own way in 2023 yeah uh which is probably the easiest thing to do yeah say hey I I had a plan that was working I spent a couple years learning this do it don't don't try and Dabble too much now in 2024 where we are right now you're up 73% for the year mhm which is great have you done anything different in 2024 uh more uh expansion into uh undefined risk and more into um the Futures options Market uh just outside of es primarily still in just more um staying away from the big op the actual future itself more just into the op got it and what what kind of actual strategies are you using primarily ratio spreads in the Futures options and you're doing like one by twoos 2 by 3es that kind of thing precisely yeah nothing nothing too huge nothing too fancy nothing crazy just I get that buying power keep it in the that size account yeah, 2,000 000 per position buying power yeah the ratio spreads are very Capital efficient to the Futures more so than equities are you doing any what kind you what are you do in the equity markets CH chasing volatility whatever it is I'm I'm produ IND different right if it's got I shouldn't I am product indifferent as long as it's liquid um sure which I think is goes on said but I I'll say it nonetheless yeah no that's great what do you think a you need to improve on and what do you do different this year if anything hm it's a pretty heavy question uh improve on I'll say is um reacting just a little quicker on putting the position on sometimes I'll I'll you think about it too much I I I catch up in what's what's the best strategy I should use here and sometimes you just need to put one on and yeah you can put a second one on if you think of a better strategy but but put the first position okay um and I you know I've probably missed a few moves for that just waiting what I'm thinking I think so yeah yeah just the hesitation is like it should be this I hate by the way I hate when I hesitate cuz it always comes back to by me always thinking about it you know yeah yeah I've also had uh you know improve on a couple uh losers that I didn't manage because I was waiting for the market to come back how aggressively do you manage as aggressively as I can with the losers being the ones that I don't and they come back and hurt how aggressive are you in closing your trades are you doing it you know kind of like our mechanic show ear 21 days yeah um and there's even times where I I might I try to stay as close as I can to the mechanics but uh if I have a winner who's coming Tesla's a great example coming into whatever Nows what they had last week with I had a winning position on it was nowhere near 50% but I took it off like it wasn't wasn't worth no the risk of it do you trade any binary events uh occasionally but they probably hurt me more than they help me you hurt me so I'm just ask it uh you know the uh one of my biggest losers this year was was in the bond position uh around binary events keep it was defined risk yeah still hurts when you lose a defined risk trade I like it that's a good way to end this um Michael thank you this has been a really great talk and I think that you know tasty Nation getting to know you it's just uh it's a bonus for them and it's a cool story so thanks so much appreciate it thanks so much time
