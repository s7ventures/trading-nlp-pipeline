  "what we asked the research team to do was to look at different streaks in Zer TT trades and I actually put that question in our research uh then let's take a look let's go bth let's take a look nice good for them so the efficient market hypothesis says that information from recent Market action should already be incorporated into current market prices we believe that despite this we recently observed that following losing 45 DT premium position short premium positions with the long premium",
  "short premium positions with the long premium position could improve performance over long periods just to mess everything up does this hold up when looking at some of the most efficient and liquid assets out there like the zero DT SPX options let's go to next slide so we did a study and this time we're going to 20 months of zero DT option data We examined the 20 Delta strangles that short strangles at the market open with winners Clos at 25% of the initial price and losers left alone we",
  "25% of the initial price and losers left alone we examine the results from four approaches always selling strangles okay mhm always buying strangles okay okay following a winning short strangle with another one but following a losing short with a long strangle so we called that you flipping the cards no no no we're calling that what worked yesterday oh okay all right that's fair enough whatever worked yesterday you do next today okay and then the opposite is reversing that just being contrari",
  "opposite is reversing that just being contrari okay okay I bet there's going to be some big swings in this I haven't seen it let's let's just go through these one more time so everybody knows what we're looking at this is fun oh no no no Beth go back oh Beth you ruined everything everything you showed us what cup the ball was under always selling when you need them go ahead always selling strangles always buying strangles following we're calling this what we yesterday following short strangles",
  "this what we yesterday following short strangles winning short strangles with another one or following losing short strangles with a long strangle so flipping it over or reversing that and following winnings with winning short strangles with a long strangle and win and losing um and losing long strangles with a short strangle okay so just the complete opposite and then all trades it got out no there no wings on this trade if you want to do Wings subtract a little money let's let's next slide",
  "subtract a little money let's let's next slide and see where we we ended up okay 20 Delta short strangles if all you did was sell strangles 93% winners and we haven't done the streaks yet if all the strangles were bought 66% winners how could that be the answer is because remember we're only taking profits of 25% that's true so you can take a 25% profit on the short strangle and you can also make money in the long strangle potentially later on the day whatever ever at 25% so they're doing this",
  "day whatever ever at 25% so they're doing this intraday these are zero DTS these are all zero DTS I no no no but I mean this flip not flipping the Cards doing whatever happened yesterday they're waiting till the day to close and then doing it right the next day no no closing at 25% it's not waiting to the end of the day so whatever if you close the 25% that you just do got so the next one is what worked yesterday it's actually just what worked okay and that came out at 90% if you did the",
  "okay and that came out at 90% if you did the opposite it came out at 66% 69% here's the crazy thing everything got paid I know but I don't want to put that message out there that's a that's a strong that's a strong message you know what this message is the message is you got to manage 25% that is the message it almost doesn't matter what you do if you manage 25% because short strangles long strangles flipping over doing whatever worked yesterday and doing the opposite of what worked yesterday",
  "and doing the opposite of what worked yesterday everything worked crazy that's we need start trading more more zero days which I've told you in the past okay let's go to the next slide so here now we get into a little bit different choosing high probability trades means mostly seeing winners with a few losers sprinkled in but how frequently do we get a winner every day of the week more importantly how often do losers follow losers so next we're going to look at how frequently our short and long",
  "to look at how frequently our short and long positions with managed winners acred one two or three or more consecutive winning days and that's kind of a weird way to look at it but let's have short and long positions with managed winners occurred one two three yeah how often do losers follow Lo how often do losers follow losers follow losers and we're doing what worked yesterday and it's another how often do winners follow because this is streaks okay so we're going to look at these and and",
  "okay so we're going to look at these and and crewing them consecutive days let's go to next slide be okay so this slide here because it's the hell am I looking at here okay it's hard to look at but the top says short strangles right Beth yes Tom okay and in the left hand um because I can't read it from where I'm sitting says frequency says frequency and the bottom consecutive winners okay so the left side says frequency and the bottom access says consistent winners maybe consecutive winners",
  "says consistent winners maybe consecutive winners consecutive I couldn't see it thank you that's pretty impressive in the short strangle um you definitely take more risk oh I got it it's on my screen now perfect so cons uh short strangles the frequency and then the consecutive winners yeah that's a that's a very interesting way to look at this and you take more risk because you're short the strangles and so you get this pretty impressive reward let's go to the next slide now this one is long",
  "let's go to the next slide now this one is long strangles very different but it's still positive okay and you can see the frequency and you can see the consecutive winners basically what this is saying is that regardless of the strategy you select if as long as you manage early because these are all managed early you're going to be in the fight you're going to be in the fight yep exactly yep you're going to be in the fight at if you go to the next slide for nearly the past two years let's see",
  "slide for nearly the past two years let's see if they come up with the same thing that we came up with zero DT strangles trade at the market opening have been profitable for retail Traders short strangles were more frequently profitable with nearly 50% of two we periods being 10 out of 10 winners let's go back to slides for a second Beth these are short strangles and you can see frequency let's see where is 50% yeah you can see that's kind of like right at the mid access and these are these are",
  "right at the mid access and these are these are like 10 out of 10 winners you can see that and so go back to the last slide seven out of seven um so for short strangles they're more frequently profitable with nearly 50% of the twoe periods being 10 out 10 winners long strangles on the other hand that's that one perfect go back to the last slide long strangles on the other hand rarely went a week without a loss but had far gentler bad losses as me measured by siar so whichever side you took as",
  "me measured by siar so whichever side you took as long as you're willing to capture profits rapidly net profits were surprisingly close that's exactly what that was our same observation as long as you're willing to capture profits so it looks like everything falls apart if you hold everything too long when genius fails yes think something going to happen it's going to reverse it's going to do this when you try to squeeze everything yes very good"
