  "How can we hedge against a Black Swan event? Stick to trading mechanics by being in positions with 45 days on entry, closing around 21 days, or rolling around 21 days. Give yourself time to be right and stay small to hedge effectively. There is no way to get short enough Delta or have enough puts to fully hedge against a Black Swan event.",
  "Tony is correct, there is no way to hedge against a Black Swan event that does not exist. However, keeping your position size small can help hedge against unexpected market events."
