what percentage of my portfolio would be appropriate to put in crypto crypto is one of the best performing assets of 2024 I was underweighted in crypto by a lot 1% or or less I don't have a lot for me it's a small percentage of my portfolio you know we did a study on this years ago when crypto wasn't at the time we said one 2 or 3% gave you virtually no downside and nothing but upside based on the implied volatility of crypto and the asymmetric upside and everything else it made sense to have one two or 3% like if I asked my son who's 32 he would say he's 50% you know so really I think it depends a little on what your age is what you know how you think about markets things like that a couple of percent is an absolute no-brainer I mean the only reason we have less than 1% is because we've been a seller on the way up cuz I guess we were in early
