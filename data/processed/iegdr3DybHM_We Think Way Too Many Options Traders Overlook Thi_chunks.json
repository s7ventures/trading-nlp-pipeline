  "the four most recognized us this is we're calling this trading the small cap index part one um we we decided to break this down because a lot of people like for example I'm long small caps I'm long the Russell short the S smps and I mean obviously it's nice this morning but um hasn't really been working that well um but we got a lot of questions about different indices so we decided to do a piece on the small cap index the Russell the foremost recogniz us Equity benchmarks are the S&P the NASDAQ",
  "us Equity benchmarks are the S&P the NASDAQ the Russell and the Dow Jones while the Dow Jones is famous worldwide and the S&P is favored by uh by Traders for its focus on uh large cap companies um the the bottom line is that that the Russell like if I asked you to name a bunch of companies in the Russell it'd be hard for you yeah certainly would be yep totally agree I mean it'd be hard for any of us there's thousands of them 2,000 to be exact right um let's go next slide so the Russell 2000 is",
  "um let's go next slide so the Russell 2000 is a crucial Benchmark for the US small cap stocks it serves as a comprehensive parameter of the smaller capitalization sector providing insight into the economic contributions of emerging Enterprises often in early stages of growth God that almost sounds like that was chat GPT let's go next slide despite its importance the Russell 2000 has seen less discussion in recent years compared to other indexes um because it has been other indexes have",
  "indexes um because it has been other indexes have outperformed the Russell by a lot sure it has been even the Dow Jones which is designed for conservative investors um for conservative returns with lower risk has outperformed the Russell the reason I'm L the Russell is because everything's outperformed it that's the bottom line yeah let's go next slide so this raises the question are small companies losing momentum or is there still an advantage to investing or trading in the Russell because",
  "to investing or trading in the Russell because you know we're kind of like we love to buy The Underdogs but for the last couple of years investing everybody has bought the leaders sure um so let's take a look go go next side so to explore this let's review the nature of small cap index the market cap of stocks in the Russell is significantly smaller than those of other indices to be included a stock must have a closing price of at least a dollar and a total market cap of at least 30 million now",
  "and a total market cap of at least 30 million now remember we have some stocks now that are worth trillions sure So currently the stocks nor Russell have a much higher market cap than the minimum requirement ranging from um 3.9 billion to 92 billion um the top two weighted stocks are mstr at 92 billion and carvana cvna at 50 billion um the majority though have are much smaller in scale less than 10 billion but I'm surprised the minimum is kind of around 3.9 billion that seems high to me but it",
  "around 3.9 billion that seems high to me but it is what it is okay so let's go to next slide so in comparison the total market cap of the S&P 500 is around 50 trillion while the Russell is less than one1 of that or around 5 trillion let's just say so From perspective Microsoft alone has a market cap of 3.5 trillion while the entire Russell is actually 3.4 so Microsoft should just buy every single stock in the Russell 2000 that makes sense that's what it's one way to look at it it's a big dog",
  "what it's one way to look at it it's a big dog let's go next slide so despite the smaller size of component companies the Russell 2000 itself is not significant the iwm is the seventh most actively traded Equity Equity index based on option trading notional value and it's not far behind cues um and we put it up here on the slide so looking at the 90-day notional value the Spy blows everything away um then comes Q's then comes iwm and Nvidia is Big Nvidia trades like the q's Nvidia Tesla trade",
  "Big Nvidia trades like the q's Nvidia Tesla trade like the q's they're always the top one two in option volume too yeah totally let's go next slide so the Russell 2000 represents seven several compelling opportunities first growth potential and and now this has not played out over the last couple of years but you would think that at some point it's got to pricing inefficiency um yeah they're a little little less little less liquid and and they are very sensitive to um more sensitive to domestic",
  "very sensitive to um more sensitive to domestic economic conditions because um they got less wiggle room they got a lot less wiggle room let's go next slide and so while small cap stocks have underperformed other indices recently they've shown better performances over the long run over the past 25 years the Russell 2000 has outperformed the Spy 14 times 56% the NASDAQ 11 times and both together 10 times I'm kind of banking on that right now so the the median Ender return for the Russell is",
  "so the the median Ender return for the Russell is about 12.5% which surpasses the spies of 11.2 although it hasn't been the case recently and here you can see it on a graph we we we just graphed everything out so you could take a look if you wanted to look at um I think this is the past 25 years Prett good yeah yeah for sure it's a nice little graph next slide yeah next slide so some of the takeaways the Russell 2000 provides exposure to a broad range of small cap stocks across various",
  "a broad range of small cap stocks across various Industries and it offers diversification for sure and growth like tasty is a small cap stock where a public traded small cap stock although the Russell 2000 hasn't performed well compared to other indices in recent years over the long term it has and it's also a really good pairs trading vehicle and that's one of the positions we have on right now we're trading the Russell in a pair versus the S smps you can trade it versus NASDAQ you can do",
  "S smps you can trade it versus NASDAQ you can do whatever ratio you want it's all interesting"
