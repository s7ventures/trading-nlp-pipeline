  "I heard you mention yesterday something about buying Black Swan protection and if one were to buy Black Swan protection what Delta would you use I think anybody who's lived through sort of 2008 2009 always values their Black Swan protection I've probably lost out on a lot of money in the bull market for the last 14 years because I lived and ran money through that phase I mean it can be if you're talking about Black Swan protection you're probably talking three to five Deltas as cheap as you want",
  "talking three to five Deltas as cheap as you want to go because technically what Black Swan protection is is it's unquantifiable Delta it doesn't matter what you buy whatever you buy is going to work if it if that happens personally I do not like this and I do not buy Black Swan protection I keep my position size small and that's how I protect myself"
