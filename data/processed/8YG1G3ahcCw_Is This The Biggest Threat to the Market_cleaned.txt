we all know you see things a bit differently than the public what do you think is the biggest threat to the market right now well it's not any of those things you mentioned because the market is tradable and we're at all-time high so just like Tony said whatever War we're looking at whatever election we're looking at we're at alltime highs nobody cares and you do see it a little bit different than the public out them it's very blurry for you right because I see you squint a lot how do you see what is the thing that you're looking at that's cute thank you so the biggest risk this market is when you're at record highs is that hey everybody's all in everybody and again I think this is unintentional but everybody ends up on the same side of the marketplace then they all look at each other and like okay who's going to get out first
