let's do it let's do everybody's favorite occurrences what's An Occurrence and why does it matter we talk about occurrences a lot we talk about why it is important to or why it can be beneficial to achieve a high number of occurrences for certain types of strategies um but I wanted to talk in detail about exactly what an occurrences because I think there's some nuances that could lead to an interesting discussion oh man we to prove this in advance we're going to have a lot of arguments I think over what An Occurrence is what could it possibly be I don't know but let's get into it um so we talk right about trading often and because uh the really goal behind trading often is achieving a high number of statistical occurrences and the idea behind that is that it reduces strategy variance and increases the chances of realizing long-term averages over time so if you have a strategy that is likely to have a positive expected value over time such as a short option strategy when we look at long-term pnls then in order to most likely realize that um you generally want to trade frequently and over a long period of time but there's a little bit of nuance ining exactly what An Occurrence is and so today I wanted to talk about it and why it kind of matters yeah let's do it let's do it let's go to the next slide okay so for bit a bit of background um I'm sure you guys are familiar with doing your statistical analyses you guys are familiar with your stats 101 right of course we yes we live for them we live for the stats we live for the stats um but when we generally when we want to analyze some kind of population or system we typically want a large number of measurements right from that system we want a large sample size to reduce sort of sampling errors and ensure that the results are statistically representative of that system right if we're trying to measure kind of anything any kind of system any kind of population if we want to get representative statistics we generally want a large number of measurements from that system right and so when we tie this into strategies and sort of evaluating how they perform in the stock market which is a system right that evolves in time we generally want data that spans a long time and captures a variety of market conditions which then decreases the variance of those kind of short-term fluctuations on those strategy averages and provid a more accurate estimate for sort of long run expected Behavior which is kind of what we're trying to do we're playing you know long game right got it a lot of these strategies so we generally want a large number of occurrences that's kind of rooted in this sort of statistical basis for sort of trying to smooth out our pnls over time law of large numbers that is involved yeah exactly right T Tony remember the law of large numbers the central Li all our stat yeah we we Tony and I probably talk Central liit theorem once a day I I can imagine at least it's on my mind all the time I guarantee it um let's go on over to the next slide so this is kind of our background um so this right motivates this trade small and trade off in Mantra it's based on the statistical principle and assumes that if we trade sort of consistently small trades over a long period of time that's going to reduce p&l variance over time the variance of different average outcomes um that sort of arise maybe from the noise in the market and brings the strategy average closer to its expected value noting that these averages tend to be positive for a lot of the short-term or short premium strategies that we look at right you know we built our whole career around this it's an important concept that's why we built our literally built our entire career floor training career around this without knowing any of this stuff right like without knowing anything about law of large numbers or Central limit theorem we would we we did believe in the trade often NE trade small but the trade often and and I'm sure Blackjack Blackjack teaches a lot of lessons as well not really because does no blackjacket ways or lose your discipline it's actually a really fair point yeah um yeah it's a really really fair point I don't know I like I would argue I would argue that in a casino with Negative Edge trade small trade often is what the casino wants you to do exactly but not what you want to do but I think just like that looking at it from the context of that game helped me understand this a bit more just CU like markets are kind of volatile and crazy and get yeah but that would that doesn't help the consumer it doesn't no but it's just more of a nice mathematical analogy that I found interesting when I was learning about this but you're right that like it's specifically you want to trade small and often when there's evidence that there might be some kind of long-term positive expected value for that game right or at least not a negative or at least not a negative one and you know kind of gauging that is there's a lot of nuances to estimating that as well but for a lot of short premium strategies we have done back tests and there's evidence that this might be true right so that's where this trade small trade often comes from and it's rooted in this kind of statistical principle although these two guys figured it out all on their own which is awesome right but this is is all background right so this all this is kind of like where this kind of comes from what the statistical justification for doing this is right all make sense yeah okay so let's go on over to the next slide so in this sense occurrence is really considered any completed trade with a specific underlying contract type Delta expiration like 16 Delta 45 DTE spice strangle you know placing one of those trades every month or something like that is monthly occurrence that's what we are meaning when we say the word occurrence it's a completed trade with specific parameters with specific underlying contract types Deltas all that stuff but remember that when we talk about achieving a high number of occurrences this kind of underlying goal is that we want to minimize the impact of sort of short-term fluctuations on our strategy averages right we're trying to average over a bunch of different market conditions a bunch of different sort of time-sensitive risk factors right so that kind of means that ideally the occurrences that we're counting towards a specific strategy should have some variation in Risk profile that's the Nuance that I think maybe we don't talk about as much but one that I wanted to kind of bring up here so for example if you sell a 45 DTE 16 Delta spice strangle at at the open and then sell another one at noon that might not really give you the impact of two truly distinct occurrences right because the market conditions may not have substantially changed in between the time when you open the first trade and the time that you open the second trade right that's possible but we do consider those to be occurrences I know so technically they are like gen in the general sense these are just trades but if the goal of achieving a large number of occurrences is to kind of smooth out our p&l over time you're not necessarily going to get the impact of having a distinct occurrence I guess I should say um depending on how you space out your traits there's a difference between um so the way that I would explain it is there's is is like how they explain things on online there's oh God I don't know if that's how you want to do things no like there's certain number of viewers yeah but then there's also like unique viewers yeah so what you're talking about is unique viewers sure we refer to everything as kind of total views sure because for Simplicity sure we don't want to break everything down like and have to put an aster next everything so so we don't think of things in terms of unique viewers we think of things in total viewers sure I I think that like I I completely understand the perspective of Simplicity and technically that is true if you put on a trade and you close the trade like that is An Occurrence but if your goal is to achieve occurrences with the specific intention of smoothing your pnls out right yeah I understand I agree with you understanding this Nuance of what the kind of unique or distinct occurrence is I think is important right sense yeah let's go to the next slide so under normal market conditions right there is usually a strong ER case for counting a trade towards a unique occurrence for a particular strategy if there's like a little bit of buffer time that's passed between trades really what you want between your occurrences to kind of make a strong case for counting them as unique is to have a change or a shift in the risk profile of the trade that doesn't necessarily need to have like a long time to pass in order for that to happen right because like if you think about like a crazy Market um or like you know when the vix contracts by 20% in a day or something like that you have gotten that shift in Risk profile that can just ify counting kind of unique occurrences differently but for normal just regular typical market conditions usually how we would kind of like Define that or Define the strength of counting something as An Occurrence is the passage of time because a lot of these risk factors are driven by duration and changes in market conditions which kind of take time to propagate make sense yes okay so let's go to the next slide so so this was kind of an interesting um study I was talking with Jacob about this last night to get his thoughts I was going to use Theta to kind of measure this but um he's like yeah yeah maybe just look at sort of like how the p&l variance or the p&l standard deviation changes depending on how you spread your trades out in your data set and I thought that was a great idea and you kind of see something really interesting here so what we're looking at is we calculated the p&l volatility so the standard deviation of pnls for 45 DTE 16 Delta spice strangles 2013 to present these are held until expiration um and then we measured how this standard deviation changed depending on if we opened the trade every day every other day every third day Etc right how we space those trades out so this graph shows what those p&l standard deviations are depending on how we space those triangles out in their in this data set basically um so what we found is that the P pnl volatility ranged from 670 to 710 when the strangles were opened between one to five trading days apart and then it dropped to 630 so pretty significant drop when the strangles were spaced out by an average of seven trading days or nine calendar days so what what are you saying with this then let go to the next slide so there is a reason for this this sharp drop and that's mostly just because there's just this natural shift in expiration Cycles right after about seven trading days or nine calendar days on average right then the 45-day contracts from the previous cycle were close enough in that duration to count as a 45 day occurrence if that kind of makes sense right basically your expiration cycle shifted up and now something that was like 50 days is close enough to 45 days to count as another occurrence so this is just natural shifts and expiration Cycles but when we shifted over into expiration Cycles we saw a pretty significant drop in the variance of pnls which kind of suggests that spreading your occurrences out far enough to at the very least ensure that each occurrence has a unique expiration cycle might help with smooth out like smoothing out these fluctuations these p&l variances over time in regular market conditions and that time frame that kind of buffer time for 45-day contracts is about nine calendar days at least for spy kind of make sense yes does it I mean I didn't know you would come up with nine calendar days but sure it's kind of not that um surprising but it is nice to have a number which is nice to have a number I agree it's kind of nice to have a number like if you're like okay I want to space out my trades to kind of if my goal with getting these unique occurrences is to smooth out my pnls over time how many days should I I think that's interesting cuz we've never done that before that's a news there you're basically saying if you have two of the exact same trades nine days apart makes them distinct and unique occurrences they're P their risk profiles are different enough right yeah the risk profiles are different enough after nine days that they're not the exact same trade right so if I had 16 Delta spr 16 Delta spy strangles right and I'm trying to get that duration to about 45 days if I'm trying to put on you know however many occurrences then spreading them out by about nine days right that's yeah that's that's the number yeah at least from this one particular backg it's a good thing to have Julia because we never went like that we would always say you know I don't know wait a couple of days or next day or you know something like that yeah yeah yeah we never we never had any context around that which is also fine I I got to emphasize that it's also fine because remember we're trying to we're trying to make sure that we're getting different risk profiles and that can happen over a day or two days I just want to be very clear we're talking about unique occurrences as opposed to just occurrences we're talking about unique occurrences yes we're if the variable that we're trying to optimize over is reducing smoothing out our p&l over time and we want to maybe use unique occurrences as a way to do that then N9 days is about again nuances here a lot of nuances here but not on average about N9 days is how much time to spread out occurrences by at least according to the study okay yeah yeah that's cool I like NE next slide yeah okay so to conclude trade small trade often is based on the sort of statistical principle that consistent small trades over a long period of time reduces p&l variance from that might arise from like the noise in the market right but if the goal is to minimize the impact of these short-term fluctuations on our strategy averages then our trade occurrences specifically unique occurrences should ideally have some variation in Risk profile and so one way that you can do this obviously like there's a lot of different factors that can cause the risk profile of a trade to change but in kind of like regular old market conditions um one way to do this is by spreading out occurrences far enough apart to ensure that each has sort of a unique expiration cycle and that's about nine days nine calendar days for 45-day contracts at least for spy good it's something different I like it kind of different yeah I don't want to discourage people from occurrences because like we count adjustments sure you know we count reentering adjustments opening closing whatever it is yeah we don't do a lot of like one of the things that Tony and I do that's that's probably that saves us a lot yeah is we don't like fall in love with the trade to the point where we say okay I put a trade on in the in the morning and now it's a dollar better this afternoon we're going to do more of it yeah like we don't think like that I know that was an extreme case for sure just because it really happens for us either so I mean we don't really come up with that too much well this is this is something that I got a lot of questions about like every time we have a live show I get questions about it um you know like emails I get emails about it which is like well why don't I just trade 10 puts right that is that 10 occurrences and I mean in a way that kind of is right but like you're really not getting the sort of like time diversification I guess I should say from spreading those trades out over time so if you put on a trade every day and market conditions for change for a bunch of different reasons um those are occurrences as we Define them but when we're thinking about using occurrences as a tool to smooth out sort of these short-term fluctuations then you know getting kind of space or getting a buffer time from those fluctuations is something that's I think kind of important to keep in mind but again this is a huge simplification this doesn't account for like all these factors that you talked about like adjustments and rolling and like crazy changes in volatility in tray for example like there's a whole bunch of factors that affect this but this is kind of more of just for regular old market conditions for Market you know index um options that kind ofu understood we get it
