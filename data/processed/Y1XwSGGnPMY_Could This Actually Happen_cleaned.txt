so I've been hearing a lot of opinions about what the market will do next I'm wondering if stagflation does hit the US economy again is that good for option Traders since selling strangles or iron Condors will most likely be profitable are there strategies that work better in different economic environments this is the season you know you got October November people start talking about what's going to happen next year and quickly go away by February and March when uh the real Market tells you what's going on because there's no way to predict anything else I have no idea I guess a year or two years just like Tony said a year two years three years from now they'll tell us if we were trading in a period of stagflation and and what that actually meant but when the things are happening it's absolutely impossible to separate what your views are of an economic environment with a strategic trading and investing it's just it's not possible opportunity presents itself on a case-by casee basis not on a macro picture
