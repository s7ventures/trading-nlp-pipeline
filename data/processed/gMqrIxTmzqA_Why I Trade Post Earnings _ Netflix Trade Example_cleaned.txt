welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today January 23rd 2025 but first I got to give a big shout out to one of my mentors in trading when I was just an 18-year-old kid Kenny Weiss happy birthday to you my friend thank you for getting me started in this business 83 years young I wish you all health and success you can have but anyway right now let's take a quick look at the market even &ps what are they doing they're up $9.75 uh NASDAQ futures are up I'm sorry down $55 and the Russell is up two and change the Dow which has been the strongest of the of the group is up 244 today so far volatility in by 31 cents remember his volatility goes lower gives a little bit of um legs to the market usually lifts the market up a little bit higher remember yesterday volatility was a little bit expanded maybe because some of those numbers that were coming out that probably affected the bonds more than anything else but I think kept a little volatility in the market it's now being taken out all right what are we going to do as I always do or I always I typically do I go to my watch list and I look for something uh to trade I usually take out earnings because I don't want to have earnings inside uh my trade so I just click on this earnings and put them in order and you'll see that the earnings start here I'm not going to look at those options when you go through this there's not going to be a lot of options as a lot of stocks here as you can see that have an ivx 5day change that's the implied volatility of each op of each stocks uh implied volatility move over the last 5 days you'll notice Delta Airlines might be a nice C uh nice candidate here uh implied volatility over the last five days is actually expanded uh by 2% with the other stocks like American Airlines that came out with with earnings and other stocks uh in its field coming out with earnings Delta Airlines doesn't have earnings until after uh I think April expiration so that might be a nice candate let's take a quick look at it uh with a with an ivy rank of 36 or 37 the stock has been nothing but straight up maybe a little bit of a fade here maybe a skewed iron Condor we'll go into March options and I look here and you say oh no it does have a good I rank uh sorry implied volatility of 39 we already discussed the IV rank of 36 is good the implied volatility of 39 must be good because the IV rank is good relative to this stocks move with only a $6 expected move when you go about $6 higher uh on on this stock you're you're getting a couple you know you're getting basically dollar options here meaning I'm going to go to the 72 A5 or 75 I like to go to the 15ish delta I guess I would default to the 23 is Delta here and if I go down by the same uh $6 or so trying to go outside that expect to move at 60 or 61 62 is going to be a little bit uh maybe a little bit too close uh probably profit of only 59 or 60 I would probably have to go out another strike here uh to to get that higher pop that I want I want to have that 65 or above pop I'd have to do something like this and for me selling options that are under a dollar uh even though it does use a limited amount of buying power just about $700 or just under $25 for me to get 50% of that to even take a profit of a dollar well it just doesn't seem a good use of capital but I get it it does have the mechanics it does fit um it's basically a delta neutral trade here short five maybe in a smaller account that's something you might want to do that you think is Delta Airlines a little bit more neutral um I also looked at at maybe um a reverse uh Jade lizard uh I looked at maybe selling a put spread I like to sell I collect onethird the width of the strikes so I might have to go to right at the money here what you're noticing here is this low IV or monthly implied volatility or low expected move on the stock doesn't give you a lot of options when I do a reverse Jade lizard which is selling a puts spread and selling a naked call I can't collect $5 here unless I'm going really right at the money a very tight tight um spread here and I don't even collect $5 so I threw out uh Delta Airlines and I decided to go to a post earnings trade in Netflix let me put Netflix up there for you uh Netflix already had earnings you'll notice that the implied volatility the IV rank is relatively low um at 177% very very low something we wouldn't look to sell premium in so I'm going to change my strategy a little bit here uh ivx 5day change obviously after earnings the stocks imply volatility is going to go lower it's 18 down by 18% so you got a applied volatility low you got a relatively low uh monthly implied volatility you got the stock after earnings that's the only positive it had this big pop which leads me to kind of think about trying to fade it I put this trade on when the stock was up $17 you you'll probably be able to put it on better with the stock up $24 right now let's take a look this trade does have um some hidden uh risk to it which I'll explain to you right now I'm going to do a broken wing butterfly in here and I'll explain to you why when you look at a stock like Netflix option pricing one thing if you've been trading or watching this podcast for a long time you should learn is to look for or recognize uh skew if there's put skew or call skew usually in like a product like an ETF like spy there's going to be put skew and usually in a product like a highflying stock like Netflix and Tesla and even Apple they'll usually have call skew if a stock has call skew call spreads trade cheap and naked options trade expensive call spreads trade cheap and naked calls trade expensive when you're looking to sell Naked calls they trade expensive you get a lot of premium for them and when you're looking to buy call spreads they trade cheap you don't pay a lot for them because the expected move is so large let me show you what skew looks like for those who don't if I go to the 980 which is basically the at the money right now and I go up by $100 to 1,080 you'll notice these calls are offered at around $12 if I go to 980 and I go down to 880 I'm just going equal distance away you'll notice that these puts are offered at around $825 calls are trading at at um at $12 just about $112 and the puts are trading uh just about $8 $4 $3.50 in call skew equal distance away a $100 expected move there's an $80 expected move in March with 57 days I'm going to march with 57 days because February the monthly options uh in February um with 29 days are too short dated meaning I'm going to have to roll cancel close this trade with 21 days being optimal so I'm going to give myself a little bit of time to be right I'm going to buy one call spread and I'd like to sell a naked option but it's going to use too much buying power for most people's account so I am going to change it and do a broken wing butterfly so I'm going to buy one spread and sell another I've done many of these on this podcast um but I'm going to do one in Netflix right now so I have up here for you to see Delta and probability of touch so when I'm looking to buy a spread I want to have a high probability of touching that number and high for me is about 50% like I want a 50/50 shot that the in the that the spread that I'm buying has a chance to be in the money so let's go to the 1040 calls I'm going to buy one of those even though it only has a 30 Delta there's almost a 60% chance that we will be at 1040 in the next 57 days at some time during the life of this trade you'll notice here and you should be careful these spreads are $20 wide between the two strikes 1040 1060 1080 1100 1120 they're not $10 wide as you see here um at a th000 1,000 1,10 th20 th30 1,40 so be careful make sure you're going equal distance away or imbalanced to the amount of strikes that you want to I'm going to when I do a broken wing butterfly I like to buy a $20 um uh $20 wide spread and sell twice as much or double a $40 spread so I'm buying let's do this for for for first I'm buying the 1040 1060 $20 wide spread I'm buying that one one time and now I'm going to sell another 1060 and buy not the 1080 that would be a regular butterfly with a very low probability of success 10% of basically nailing this at 1060 I'm going to go all the way to 1,00 so I'm buying the 1040s one time I'm selling two of the 1060s and I'm buying one of the 1140s I'm $20 wide by $40 wide I'm risking two to make one I'm risking two $40 to make $120 because my Max profit is $2,000 and change 2,000 and whatever you sell this spread for I actually sold it for a157 you could do better than me yes the markets are a little bit wider here I did mine when the stock was up around $19 I got filled just around mid price how did I get filled around mid price I watched as the stock was moving and seeing what the mid price is and I went above if I was looking at this right now with the stock up $24 half dollars I wouldn't expect to get filled at $2 but I would put it in at $2 and then walk it down maybe go down to$ 195 go down to the mid price of 188 and change and then go 5 seven8 cents below mid price if I don't get filled I let it sit right there I got filled at a157 Max profit here on the trade that you're looking at uh is $2,177 that's the credit you received uh plus the width of these strikes so for the18 $0000 in buying power you're using you do have a Max profit of $21.80 but as I showed you that pin of 1060 is relatively small at 10% we can look at what the probability of pinning that $2,000 is by just looking at a butterfly a regular butterfly equal distance $20 $20 $20 away to give us what our probability is of having a Max profit of $2,100 so that's not what I'm looking to do what do I really want to happen here with my break even um at around 1,080 uh which is right at that standard uh deviation line that we see here that's dotted line um what's my expectation here well I'm looking to make a dollar maybe a dollar or more on this trade how can I make that dollar a dollar more well you'll notice here this green line there is no risk to the downside side there's no risk to the downside because we are long one spread short another spread defined risk trade my defined risk is $18 $100 and it's all to the upside right at a standard deviation what do I want to happen I want the stock to slowly climb or sit or go down slowly climb sit or go down I want time to go by or I want the stock to go lower or I want the stock to slowly climb up so this out of the money spread that I'm sure it loses some value and this in the money spread um gains a little value volatility can also go lower and this spread would go higher I'm sorry this spread would go lower also but you know what with Ivy rank so low I'm not going to play for that or look to expect for that to happen in this trade why did I say this has a little bit of extra kind of risk to it well a stock is wrapped around $1,000 and in this market a lot of stocks have started to uh split one by 10 or uh or 2x5 some split and if we do split this stock that's usually slightly bullish it does play up to our one standard deviation move which can be nice but it will increase the number of contracts you have after the split so if this stock were to split in the next 57 days and it split 10 for one you would have a 10 by 20 by 10 spread when you came in for about 19 cents for where it's trading right now it would still be the same $1.90 in credit it would still be the same amount of buying power nothing would change except for the number of credits that you have all right ladies and gentlemen I hope you enjoyed a couple of hidden lessons in there too some of
