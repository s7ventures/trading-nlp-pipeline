  "so a couple weeks back we talked about one way to analyze the potential impact of a single stock on a broader index so if a stock is expected to move 5% and it's makes up like some you know it's one of the components of the index how much can we expect the index to move there's a way to calculate that so today I did my very very best to back test this um and it's very hard to do for reasons that I will get into but I really wanted to look at some significant moves and some major names over the",
  "significant moves and some major names over the last year approximately and understand how the realized moves in the S&P kind of compared to that so those expected estimates sounds yeah okay let's try to get through this quickly this a recap um I I'm probably not going to spend a lot of time on this if you want to go check out that segment it was from two weeks ago but basically the expected move of a stock or I'm sorry the expected impact on a stock can be estimated if you have an expected um",
  "stock can be estimated if you have an expected um return for one stock and the correlation between the two of them so for example like let's say that two stocks A and B are correlated with a correlation of 08 and expected a is you know going to stock a is expected to move 5% around earnings so the expected impact I guess on Stock B is just the correlation between them times that expected move so 4% make sense okay yep okay next slide okay so um that previous case is if we assume the",
  "okay so um that previous case is if we assume the volatilities are similar we can also sort of like beta weight this a little bit by taking the volatility of right the standard deviation of returns of stock whatever you're interested in dividing it by the expected um the standard deviation of returns of whatever you have the expected move for makes sense you've been doing this for years beta weighted notional um IV very similar very similar but this is for expected move if you want to consider",
  "this is for expected move if you want to consider the expected stock on another stock right yeah I understand okay let's go to the next slide so if you wanted to extend this logic to an index right you take that formula yeah multiply by the weight of that holding in the index and then you just sum all them up okay right you're just taking a weighted sum of all those expected moves basically make sense so like if I wanted to calculate like apple is you know going to move 5% we're expecting it to",
  "you know going to move 5% we're expecting it to move 5 5% when it reports earnings what is the expected move in the index right I can take all the Holdings of the index I can take the correlation between all those you know Holdings and apple and I can use this formula to calculate how much should the S&P move from that move expected make sense yes easy peasy okay let's go to the next slide then so what I wanted to do was actually try to look at some data to see how well this holds up um so it's",
  "data to see how well this holds up um so it's very difficult to do this type of back test for like two reasons number one um there's not a lot of very big moves that you can really look at over you know some time frame um here I wanted to look at the top Holdings of the S&P so that's Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta or Google they all kind of move around in the top like six spots basically um over the last couple of years and so I wanted to say okay on the days when these you know assets had",
  "okay on the days when these you know assets had moves that were larger than 5% either to the upside or to the downside what was the expected in you know index impact there's not a lot of moves like that that happened um in this period of time and then in addition to that you also need the historical weights of the S&P over your back test period and those aren't really easy to get so not a lot of data here but I wanted to see if there was maybe something interesting that could come about and so",
  "interesting that could come about and so here we looked at from 2024 to 2025 we want to see like apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon meta and Google like when they have a move greater than 5% or less than 5% how did the SNP what was the expected move in the S&P and then how did it actually move what were those results make sense using that formula that I showed on the previous slide sure okay let's go to the next slide so um on unsurprisingly when a major holding in the S&P um has a large move to the",
  "holding in the S&P um has a large move to the upside or to the downside the index is unsurprisingly expected to follow suit in fact um for moves that are this large remember we're looking at plus minus 5% um the index in this very limited data set was expected to have the same sign of daily return so move to the upside or to the downside um at the same time 100% of the time right so like if any of those Holdings move like 5% to the upside we would expect that the S&P should be positive that day",
  "expect that the S&P should be positive that day based on this expected return that we looked at in the previous slide does that kind of make sense yeah totally which totally makes sense as you would expect right Tony yeah sure makes sense I I'll give you a size up answer yeah it makes sense um it's a um we're again we're looking at very large moves so like here we're looking at like mea was up 20% we would expect the S&P to move up some percentage and generally we'd expect that to be positive",
  "and generally we'd expect that to be positive if meta is moving to the upside 20% that's itively what we're saying here in this back test when we looked at the expected moves for these very large moves in the Holdings of the S&P um we would expect that the S&P would have at the very least the same sign as this company that was moving very much to the upside or to the downside in this back test does that kind of make sense yeah let's go to the next slide so when we looked at the actual moves we",
  "slide so when we looked at the actual moves we did see that like the direction kind of aligned like aligned with the expected move but the actual numerical values differed by quite a bit um so here we have all of those those you know those I think it was like 36 data points all of those big moves in those six Holdings over the last year and that the kind of hatched bar shows the expected move and then the kind of solid bar shows the realized move and then it's green for positive and it's red",
  "and then it's green for positive and it's red for negative what we can see is that when we expect a positive move in the S&P S&P is usually positive when we expect a negative move in the S&P the S&P is usually negative um but the actual size of that move can vary from its expected value quite a bit bit and that's usually because there are a ton of other factors that are actually moving the markets we're looking at very extreme moves so these are kind of edge cases oh what are you trying to",
  "are kind of edge cases oh what are you trying to prove trying to prove anything um but I did notice something a little bit weird that inspired this back test that I'll talk about in a second and I kind of wanted to talk about it that make sense okay I'm just trying to figure out what you're trying to what what you're going for here let's go to the next slide so I wanted to look at a couple interesting examples Maybe um and I don't know if we're going to have time to do it but um so in February",
  "going to have time to do it but um so in February 2nd meta jumped over 20% after earnings the expected move in the S&P was about 3% but it only moved 1% okay let's go to the next slide so on August 5th Nvidia dropped over 6% and the expected move in the S&P was 75% however the S&P dropped almost 3% because that was also coupled with concerns around the Nicki crashing right over 12% okay so we can see there's a lot of instances when these kind of like external factors sort of like move the",
  "of like external factors sort of like move the markets in ways that sort of deviate from these expected moves but what we do actually see if we go to the next slide is that 89% of the time the signs of the expected moves and the realized moves were the same right so even though like you know Nvidia dipped um I'm trying to think how to describe this so even though like you know Facebook's earnings or meta's earnings might have caused this very large move the actual move in the S&P might not line",
  "move the actual move in the S&P might not line up with that expected value but the signs usually do that happened about 89% of the time so we found that it was actually pretty weird generally speaking for the move in the index not to match the sign of one of these major Holdings sort of when they have a big move does that make sense yeah so the overall the expected moves and the realized moves were this yeah sure that kind of makes sense right yeah but interestingly so and that's kind of what",
  "yeah but interestingly so and that's kind of what inspired this a little bit if we go to the next slide we had two deviations from that like recently actually um two pretty significant deviations um and we'll talk about that more in the next slide there we go so on January 30th Microsoft dropped 6% after earnings um and there were other concerns that kind of like you know were also bubbling up around that time as well on February 5th Google dropped over 7% also around earnings and the expected",
  "over 7% also around earnings and the expected drop in the index was 1.7% so in both of those cases we expected some pretty big drops in the S&P but they actually turned out green you remember those days it happened pretty recently yeah yeah I mean I don't remember like there's a lot of days when when Google or Microsoft or Nvidia had big even mostly Apple have had huge moves and and the index has done not what we expected but I I think I remember both those days that's weird that doesn't happen",
  "both those days that's weird that doesn't happen a lot when we're talking about moves that are greater than 5% it's actually weird for one of the top Holdings in the S&P that does not happen very much that happens like like in in this data set it's happened recently more so I feel like because like like just in apple alone and then and then Tesla had you know dropped 30% as the market was going higher for the last two weeks so it's kind of weird there been a few weird moves like that it's weird",
  "there been a few weird moves like that it's weird and it's been kind of recent and two data points is not enough to like indicate a trend and there's been other data points as well we were just looking at like six companies basically um but I kind of wanted to look at this because I think it's worth watching over the next couple of months CU it has felt weird and I wanted to look at see if any data kind of supported that and it turns out like two very big moves two very big drops in Microsoft",
  "very big moves two very big drops in Microsoft and Google like we would have 100% expected the market to end red those days and it turned out green yeah and I'm wondering if that kind of might indicate that there's some shift in market dynamics right now or some maybe shift away from Tech or some shift away from AI or something that could be resulting in maybe more optimism um that was kind of reflected in the index uh after these two very big drops happened those were weird um and I kind of",
  "drops happened those were weird um and I kind of wanted to try to do a study that showed a little bit of context to show exactly why because it's not out of the realm of possibility for Apple to drop 3% or for you know Tesla to drop 4% and the index to wind up green but when Microsoft drops 6% and Google drops 7% and we're expecting the S&P to drop almost two and almost 2% in both of those cases and then it turns out green that's weird um it's not weird but it deviates from sort of the expected",
  "weird but it deviates from sort of the expected behavior that we can measure at least looking at the last year's worth of data that's what I was kind of trying to look at I get it I mean it just mean it just means it's broad-based the market is kind of I'm not sure that I can draw any takeaways from this that I can actually use yeah I that's yeah that's why I kind of I wanted to try the back test and the back test was difficult um for the reasons that I described but it was really those two",
  "that I described but it was really those two data points that I found really interesting and I that's why I found found it was interesting cuz like I've been feeling this in my portfolio personally where we'll have these really big moves but then the indexes won't move very much and it felt like that's been happening more recently but it was really hard to actually measure that and this was kind of my attempt at sort that's fair I mean there have definitely been some individual stock moves you",
  "definitely been some individual stock moves you know today's another example but um and may I could I don't know if some of it has to do around earnings time or not but yeah I I understand where you're coming from I just don't know how to I don't know what how to take something away from this I could actually use yeah it's difficult to say because again it's not a lot of data that we're working with like if the indexes are maybe more resilient now than they have been um to some of these moves",
  "now than they have been um to some of these moves or a little bit more insulated from some of these moves it's a little it's you can't really claim that from a couple of data points but it's a trend that I want to keep watching um as we sort of continue to have like more you know volatility in 2025 so it's kind of that was the point beautiful lovely sick let's go to the takeaway slide we'll finish up so the potential impact of a single stock on an index can be estimated using historical price",
  "an index can be estimated using historical price data and a detailed list of index components and component weights and based on this very limited back test the data roughly supports that when major holding is expected to undergo a large move we can expect the direction of the index move to match um and large moves resulting from earnings might move the index less than expected compared to you know moves resulting from Market or sector-wide events but we kind of need to do more research to be",
  "but we kind of need to do more research to be able to validate that and as well the recent if there is a trend it's not really measurable yet because there haven't been there hasn't been enough data but I think it's worth watching going into 2025 um because it's it's felt a bit weird trading and it was kind of hard to actually put numbers behind that before this kind of test sort of came out I don't know if there's a trend and I don't know if it's a bad thing either I don't know either yeah"
