welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the bat Batista right here in downtown Chicago right here in the Batcave we're going to come at you with a nice little trade on 1010 the Tesla numbers coming out today after the close but I'm not going to go to Tesla today I'm going to do something a little bit different I'm going to show you something I think is very interesting and a nice way to look at volatility in oil related products hey first let's take a quick look at the market Ean S&P is down $13 NASDAQ down $36 and change Russell the weakest of the group down almost 1% continues to be weak uh down $21 in change and the Dow down 120 I said just now that the that the Russell is the weakest of the group and uh comparing to some of the other uh indices if you take a look here at the Russell Ean S&P graph you'll notice here that it's at an extreme it's about as low as it's been that's a onetoone relationship between being long Russell short &ps or long the Russell stocks versus short the &ps if you change this uh to NASDAQ it will show you the same thing for SL NQ if you look at that you'll notice that it's almost at the same extreme not quite as large I don't have that position on I wouldn't look to put that position on but it is interesting for people that are looking uh for divergences in markets that might think hey maybe it's time to buy the the Russell here a little bit I personally don't think it's that time but there is something to take a look at in oil oil up a137 today and you'll notice that the ivy rank is quite High here at 89 it's about as high as it's been in recent uh history here as the product is pretty much range bound uh especially the higher end up around 82 now oil always has a call skew to it and what's call skew let's take a look at these November options we like to go closest to 45 days the mechanics don't change whether you're trading uh Futures options or Equity uh options now let's take a look at what I was just saying a moment ago about you know closest uh call skew how far you can go from the closest to at the money let's just say 74 a half or 75 uh is the at the money uh strike right now even though you're looking at the future at 74 that's the one you're Trading remember when you're trading Futures options you're always trading the future that's represented in your months you'll notice right here this future the Z4 is trading at $74 the future that's going to go away going to go away in about a week which is still the front month and that's reflected up here is trading 7470 so remember the product that I'm going to be trading with 36 days to go is trading at $74 not 7472 a little Nuance about Futures and Futures options make sure you're trading the future that represents or you're looking at the future that represents the month that you're in you can notice as oil gets further uh out in time it's actually getting lower usually you would see something where the front month is lower and the back month has more cost to carry I don't think that's an anomaly for any type of future Direction but it is something to check out and notice when that's happening another thing you should notice about is skew let's get back to that so that the at the money is 74 that's why this line is right here at 74 and not up at 74.5 or closer to 75 if it was showing you that the future was trading 7472 showing you that the future is trading closer to 74 that's what that line is here in the middle that's the at the money strike so let's go $10 up just to take a quick look and you'll notice that that option is trading around $160 on the offer now let's try to see if there call or putc you go down from 74 down to 64 all I'm doing is going an equal distance away from the at the money all things being equal each strike has the same probability of success to it but look the 84 is trading for 82 cents that means that the I'm sorry the 64 is trading for 82 cents that means the 84 call option has twice as much almost twice as much premium even though it's an equal distance away which means that Delta is going to be larger too you notice the Delta here is 24 on the call and the Delta here on the put uh is closer to 15 14 15 so as volatility expands options get more Delta to them that's why your Delta will change when you have a position on that's equal distance away like a strangle when volatility expands and contracts your Delta's Dynamic good way of looking at it what am I going to look to do here well I'm going to show you one more thing first I'm going to go to ovx semicolon CGI okay you'll notice that there's no options for this because this is just a crude oil um VIX Index what you could do is look at what that's been doing that's really just showing you what the volatility and now that I just showed you what skew is what the skew and volatility is doing in oil ovx is oil don't ask me the CBOE came it's the cbee product I don't know why they name it like this but that's how it is you'll notice it's about as high as it's been yeah it was higher day two or three but you'll notice if you're looking for a median or mean price you would say it would be around 34 or 35 so there's an awful lot of call skew here uh there's typically always call skew in oil but now that call skew is at an extreme I'm going to take advantage of that by going back to the well in for slcl I did a 1x two ratio spread a few days ago we were able ble to take it off for a $100 Pro uh product uh profit I'm going to go back to that well today take on a little bit more risk because when I placed the other trade on in oil uh about a week or so ago we had more time we able to go further away from at the money and I was able to go a little bit wider but I still like this trade because it has that high implied volatility and skew I'm going to go to around the well I said the 15ish Deltas where I normally like to go I'm going to go about to the 18 Delta that's taking a little bit more risk especially with the product being a little bit higher getting a little bit closer I'm going to buy one of the 88 uh calls I'm going to sell two two of the 94 calls now I personal preference typically like to trade the whole numbers um even though the the the stri the there it's three cents wide here it's three cents wide here it's 3 cents wide here two cents wide here two cents wide here if all the options have the same uh with to the bid ask then I'll trade any one of the strikes I'll trade the 88 and a halfs or or 88s or or or 93 and a half doesn't make a difference to me but when the options get a little bit wider the whole number options typically have tighter markets so as a little kind of thing I like to go into a little bit of a tip a little bit of a of a um tighter Market I got filled at 37 cents I believe let me take a look if that's 100% true go here to the follow page go to Bob the trader with my smiling face and I did get filled at 37 cents I gave you a little bit of a description here going back to the well see what I did there a 1 by two omnidirectional bearish ratio spread with massive call skew I just showed you that massive call skew but if you don't want to wait to see this podcast maybe get a little hint to where I'm going on what I did and that's always the price there you can click duplicate this trade right on the T trade platform it'll go right out there and populate it for you um but let's go back to that trade page if I can in CL just to take a quick look at some of the numbers 97% pop got to like that $30 a day in Theta Decay because um this is remember this is almost 10 times the size it is 10 times the size of a Uso so a 1 by two ratio spread here is really like a 10x $20 10x 20 ratio spread contract wise in Uso so this is not for everybody even though it only uses $3600 let's call it $3,700 in buying power your max profit could be $637 let's just round down to $6,000 because you are long this 1 by two long 188 call short two 90 calls 94 calls and if not a great probability but if we got a pin in oil at 94 and you're still in this trade at expiration which you would not be able to because you're going to want to get out of this trade a week or so before uh expiration plus with span margining your buying power is going to increase the closer you get to uh expiration in time and closer you get to expiration in at the money so if the stock was trading at 94 this buying power can go up you know twofold at least I could check that out for you in just a quick second I did this the last time but let me digress for a moment it's $66,000 because if this product was at expiration at 94 just a sco under this 88 call would be worth $6 that $6,000 this $94 calls that your short the two of them would be worth nothing you sold it for $370 not 37 that's $370 that's like selling something in the equities at 3.70 $370 um you can do this in an IRA account if you're so inclined to trade oil product there on the trade platform I don't think you can do it if you're using a different platform I don't know of any other platform that allows you to do it an IRA account to be short naked calls you could be short naked calls in an equity in tasty trade uh as long as you have the amount of buying power that the trade requires let me take a look uh what else a Delta here basically Delta zero I say this is omnidirectional uh bearish spread because you'll notice this green line gets to my break even my break even is a little over $100 here now oil hasn't been over $100 and hasn't moved that much in a in a in a 36 day uh period here this would be about the biggest move we had from 66 uh to just about 80 that's uh $14 there and we're outside of that $14 uh range here so I mean to me uh that's why the trade has a high probability success $97 but you know what nobody knows anything and nobody wants to sit there with with you know a couple of ,000 loss while you wait for this to be profitable unless you have the amount of buying power uh in your account here as the product goes higher you'll notice that the mid price gets uh gets bit up a little bit so maybe you can get filled uh another $10 better than I what's my PR profit Target on this I don't know uh 100 bucks 150 bucks 200 bucks 300 bucks something like that uh this should contract nicely uh if oil goes lower that's why I said omnidirectional bearish spread because there's no risk to the downside in oil oil can go to any price to the downside obviously you just have out of the money calls so that's going to keep you um profitable there let's take a look at what I just said a moment ago uh how your buying power can change on that $6 spread I'll just go to an extreme here I'll buy one of the 60 calls I'll tell sell two of the 606 calls just to simulate that for you that $3,000 in buying power goes up to4 $1,000 so this is a big Traders product this is not for the faint of heart or for those in a smaller account at least not in my opinion I'll go to at the money buying the 70s and sell the 76s one by two I'm just simulating that same $2 uh WID spread and you'll notice that the buying power goes up to about $10,000 from the $3600 that we had before so remember your buying power is definitely going to change with span margining it's a phenomenon to Futures options it does not happen in equity options so
