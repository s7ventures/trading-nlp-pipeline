so zero DT options this is recovery rates for zero DTS zero DT option markets are some of the fastest and most liquid available for option Traders so far research has been encouraging for approaches based on premium selling and capturing profits aggressively and actually our research was even positive when you did the opposite in bought options you just had to be fast everything is fast like you got a couple of you got a couple of minutes to a couple of hours you don't have all day on the Zero DTS but one of the things we don't talk about is how do you handle losers for the research we've been letting losers go all day is there a better way to do it and when a zero DT short premium trade is looking bad what have been the costs and benefits to holding on hoping for an improvement verse closing the trade and accepting defeat Tony and I just so you know first move we make is we try to make an adjustment defensive first move is defensive second move we accept defeat we are not going to fight this before noon 1:00 hopefully before before the few first vrs like we will we will make one attempt or two attempts to fight selling premium also yeah we're premium sellers we'll make one or two attempts to fight it and then we will accept defeat we're not going to let it go to to hell you know in the afternoon 18 months worth of research looking at uh selling strangles 35 Deltas 25 deltas and 15 Delta strikes um we checked at these positions at this are central time so 10:00 a.m. hour and a half after the opening noon and 2: p.m. um we isolated those trades that were down and those trades that were down by at least 10% and 25% of initial cost so you sell something for $5 25% it goes to 10% is 550 25% is 625 We examined how those losing trades performed when they were inspected um and the close was it better to exit a loser or give it a chance to turn around all the trades were assumed to close at Mid price which is a little bit misleading because you're probably going to want to do it you're probably going to have to do it a tick or two worse and also just to save on March Mis leading but that's the way that the only way not misleading but the only way for us to figure it out so just take off another nickel or so and also if you want to buy the wings which most people do you have to take off about another dime the whole process so all right better to exit loser or give it a chance to turn around what's Your Gut I mean I exit a loser so I exit a loser too right so um let's hoping that wins I'd be I'd be okay if it doesn't though I'd be fine yeah let's go next slide and obviously s don't didn't know how many slides there are so we haven't looked at this prior so go ahead no no we've been busy and we we've been you know too busy trying to too busy trying to fix trying to disrupt all Victor Jones theories on the world on life um okay so these are 10 a.m. losers at greater than 25% of the initial credit 10 am. losers at greater than 25% of the initial credit so um and and we have it in three categories here so the Improvement percentage the average p&l change if left on to the close and the sear of holding through the close now the carar is what's going to happen you're wor wor 5% of all cases conditional value yeah conditional but it's worst 5% of all cases the middle column the 25 Delta strangles is probably the one that fits us most live in the area that we live in the most so if you improving the position it's about a 55 you know this is at 10 a.m. and this is when you have a a loss greater than okay so the Improvement is about 55% um I I if if the average pen change if you leave it onto the close is about $37 it's positive that's okay not too bad no not too shitty okay let's go to the next slide so this one this is this is if you had Losers of just greater than 10% so it's not quite as bad you know and this one you can see the Improvement numbers are you know about the same the average p&l change which this makes more sense to me because it's kind of more in line is still a positive number if you left on the close and the cab bars are always going to be high significantly higher now go to the next slide Beth and this is if you lost by any amount so this is if you you you weren't able to control you know just you had no control of what's going on and so this one the average p&l changes if you left on till the close these numbers are all going to be negative so if you you know if you're if you're able to improve the trade you you actually put yourself in a pretty good position you're able to make an adjustment you're able to approve the trade you put yourself in at least a decent position where most the outcomes are fairly positive that I think is the main takeaway from this if you go to the next slide there's just a lot of data in here I don't want to spend too much time on it so this is if you wait to noon if you wait to noon the numbers the Improvement numbers drop trtic atically and the p&l numbers all go from all positive to all negative no bueno no bueno so this suggests that if you take advantage if you take your losses quickly you improve and then take your losses quickly you're okay or you improve on it right away but I if you wait until noon and you're not do anything o gets to be tough let's go next slide 10% new losers at 10% so at this number all the hold on to the close is still a negative number so whether you have a small loser or a big loser if you wait till noon to deal with it it's not going to help you that much let's go to next slide Beth and this is for noon losers at any amount you can see that the average penal change left onto the close is a very negative number so there is no good scenario here no no good scenario okay let's go to the next slide and this is if you wait till 2:00 and my guess is that this is going to be the worst of them all based on the way this everything's setting up so the Improvement numbers are down the average PE numbers get really ugly the SAR isn't as bad because you've lost more money on the trade um and these numbers are all bad go to the next slide and this is at 10% you know this is yeah all the numbers are bad here so the Improvement yeah there there's there's no good scenario of waiting for a long time to make an adjustment this is almost as clear as day do this early and you know do it early and and essentially move on I guess let's go next slide this is should be any amount yeah every single number here is a negative number this is not pretty so the longer you wait the more trouble you get into and the numbers just don't bear out if you go to the last last slide I think it is yeah so just as aggressively capturing winners has generally been the key to success in zero DTS it has also not paid to be patient with your losers you have to aggressively we are very aggressive so this is never an issue for us we are super aggressive but you have to address this stuff aggressively trades that were down early in the day recovered reasonably well but loses losses at noon or later were better off locked in than waiting the effects were reasonably consistent across strikes and the rapid management of zero DT positions also has the advantage of freeing up buying power which we should have mentioned before that's true the zero DT option markets are incredibly fast-paced and if you want to participate in them be ready to stay attentive and active throughout the day all of our research has pointed to if you're doing the zero DT trades do them do something do something and do it fast in that first half hour 45 minutes one hour either take your profits or make your adjustments you can't set it and forget it is really what it comes down to here
