  "S&P is turned green y 12 yeah yeah Russell turn green it's up 10 cents there you go implied volatility overstatement with and profit targets with strangles oh boy this is heavy kids get your helmet on as premium sellers one of the main ways we profits through implied volatility overstatement meaning that realized VA is lower than implied Val we've done many studies in the past discussing the benefits of IV overstatement finding that IV was overstated 75 to 80% of the time depending on the time",
  "75 to 80% of the time depending on the time frame in this study we're going to dive into the effects of implied volatility on strangles exploring quick profits how quickly profits can be achieved and when we receive the most so it's going back to that 50 50% or 21 days high vers low all the above let's go next slide 12 years of research the reason we pick different time frames is just how much stuff we can we can basically just churn our way through in you know the last 24 hours this stuff's",
  "in you know the last 24 hours this stuff's all done like pretty much the day before mhm so we looked at the strangles of various Deltas at 45 days managed at 21 DT or 50% depending on the slide we bucketed the trades based on various implied volatilities over under 18 where's the vix right now the vix is it over 18 or under uh VI is trading at 1731 down 60 forward SL VX so this was we were right at the cut off this morning yeah 18 yep or last night's close yeah last night's close right we're",
  "night's close yeah last night's close right we're just under it right now then we answered the following questions what is the effect of implied volatility on strangles how many days until we hit the most profit what are the effects of managing at 21 vers 50 21 days vers 50% and how does implied volatility impact our profit targets want a guess there's a lot of questions in here okay let me ask you one by one how does implied volatility impact profit targets I'll give you a hint by a percentage",
  "targets I'll give you a hint by a percentage basis higher higher is better yeah of course I would have thought that I just don't know what percentage how many days until we hit the most profit 21 three three weeks within three weeks three weeks Tony says what are the effects of managing a 21 DT versus 50% what are the effects on the p&l I'm going to assume yes I think it's actually going to be better higher high at 21 days than 50% okay and um I have no idea I could be completely wrong on this",
  "have no idea I could be completely wrong on this I'm not positive about anything and what is the effect of implied volatility on strangles well I'm going to tell you right now that is going to be higher credits sure sure entry is the only thing you can control it's the only thing that we know for sure yep y okay let's see what we got so we start off with the theoretical pop for selling options is calculated by taking one minus the Delta of the option so if you have strangles it's then one minus",
  "so if you have strangles it's then one minus 2 times the Delta because you you're selling two options right so if you sell a 20 Delta strangle the theoretical pop is 60% that's 1 minus 2 * 20 1 - 40 is 60 right yeah people get a little confused thinking it's closer to 80% when they do that CU they're doing a 20 Delta option the theoretical Pop might be 60 but the actual Pop might be closer to 80 sure let's go next Slide the actual win rate was much higher than the theoretical pop due to the",
  "much higher than the theoretical pop due to the initial credit because also when you collect initial credit you have to subtract the credit from the numbers it's going to be a lot higher in high implied volatility the win rate was nearly identical to all occurrences but the return on Capital was was or the double right it's almost like probability of touch being almost twice as much as the Delta like you know you look at a 20 Delta option you say what's the you know this is so far out of the",
  "say what's the you know this is so far out of the money I got an 80% pop here you know there nothing is ever going to happen but you got basically a 40% chance of touch so if you look at all occurrences and you look at the 20 Delta options the actual win rate was 76 the theoretical is 60 so it's 16% higher which is big but if you look at a high implied volatility which is over 18 it was 78 and that's the world we live in um so that 78 is is a big number well the wind rate changes that's why",
  "big number well the wind rate changes that's why they highlighted there wind rate Chang even greater by these the average return on capital is is better too yes the win rate's good I mean the I meant the average return on capital is is much better too when it's higher IV that's what I'm trying to say in higher IV you're 30% above the theoretical pop and your average return on capital is 4.2% so look at that win rate with high IV 76 to 78 I mean that's I mean that's I know statistically that's",
  "that's I mean that's I know statistically that's nice that's like splitting pennies for me but doubling the average return on Capital now you're talking money now you're talking to me now you're talking to me baby higher implied volatility make more money let's go to next slide so in high implied vol not only is more credit collected but the p&l tends to be higher as a percentage of that credit so when the IV is high there are less dramatic swings in p&l from the trade to trade even with",
  "swings in p&l from the trade to trade even with further out of- the- money strangles so we'll stay at that 20 Delta p&l has a percent of the credit if it's in hi 23% and p&l volatility drops to 71 and you can see how dramatic that is against all occurrences you collect more money and you have smaller volatility swings that's the cool thing yes sir and it stays that way throughout the entire process lower p&l volatility higher p&l as percent of the credit okay so here we look at the average",
  "of the credit okay so here we look at the average number of days until hitting the most profit you said 21 the actual turned out to be 17 I was going to say side 21 is what I said but yeah I get it roughly 2 and A2 weeks after trade entry approximately 28% of the occurrences saw the highest profits come between the first and second week after trade entry I was really just piggybacking old research that we've done here we said that if trades are going to work they typically work with inside",
  "are going to work they typically work with inside three weeks which is really staying true uh here too which is great so a lot of times when people want to avoid earnings and they're looking to put on an a trade with a stock that has earnings if they send me an email they go is this a decent trade I say you know what earnings aren't for four or five weeks if the trade's going to work it's going to work within three weeks sure go ahead put it on I don't think you're going to get too affected as",
  "I don't think you're going to get too affected as volatility does increase for earnings about two weeks before the earnings so yeah that that that that that fudges it that meets the the criteria I like it well this is a really good statistic because 68% of the days with the most profit occurred before managing a 21 days M you think I'm not listening over here I know you call me silly a couple times and stuff like that but you know we're idiotic and stuff like that but I'm I got two ears and I",
  "and stuff like that but I'm I got two ears and I can't close them although I'd like to sometimes like my eyes I can close those and I do that often while we're on the show I can't let's go to the next slide Beth I don't close my ears so I do pay attention 16 Delta strangles hitting the the day is hitting the most profit 50% profit for 20 days this is interesting too managing at 50% profit led to faster profits than managing at 21 days now I manage at 21 days you know I mean I manage all the",
  "at 21 days you know I mean I manage all the time but 21 days is kind of my wheelhouse led to faster profits than managing in 21 days by roughly three 3 days however in average the p&l was 20% smaller when managed at 50% so basically the 21dt versus the 50% is pretty it's it's they're pretty much the same thing you make more money if you manage 21 days you get to manage faster if you manage 50% according to the research I think it's 6f what you know six of one half dozen another it doesn't even",
  "six of one half dozen another it doesn't even though I got it right I would say you are correct it's six of one half dozen of another you know what if you make that 50% so quickly you're probably going to look to take take it off and not let it run to have a higher gain and then a lot of times when you reach 50% it might come back the other direction too so I think for p&l volatility of your of your of your portfolio just the curve of how it behaves I think taking the profits is prudent so this",
  "I think taking the profits is prudent so this one is the P the median pnl rose with increasing implied volatility to the volatility is mean reverting nature so this one is really interesting because this is the 50% profit Target so days to reach 50% profit Target didn't decrease with higher implied volatility because of the increased initial credit only in the 50 to 75 range which doesn't really happen that often um so when you look at this the ivr range for 16 Delta strangles we're usually in",
  "ivr range for 16 Delta strangles we're usually in that 25 to 50 that that second tier the 50 to 75 is kind of rare um and the days here in this trade are about 17 and the median p l is about 76 and the initial credit about 182 that makes a lot of sense that's the way that's kind of where we mostly live in that range let's go to the last slide so pretty the pretty expected takeaways in high implied volatility increasing strangle Delta maintains win rates and doubles the return on Capital with",
  "win rates and doubles the return on Capital with the 20 to 30 Delta strangles providing the best return on Capital and a reduction in P volatility another thing to look at is the days in a trade rather than the days to expiration for 16 Delta strangles exiting at 17 days post entry maximizes profits while early management can hurt long time long-term PR Health but managing a 50% profit speeds up the profits compared to 21dt but results in lower average p&l as increased volatility doesn't",
  "lower average p&l as increased volatility doesn't necessarily Quicken gains due to the initial credit adjustments I find it way easier after you make all the adjustments just to manage 21 days"
