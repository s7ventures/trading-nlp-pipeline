  "What's the best trade you've ever made? There was a kid who used to clerk in the OEX pit. He got a job to go to the front lines in Iraq. We get a call, he goes, we're going to war tonight. Everyone in the pit is fighting to buy puts, thinking the market will crash tomorrow. Someone sold me a 50-lot of in-the-money calls because he couldn't get them.",
  "He had a large position in calls that were profitable, but he needed someone to take them off his hands. He was worried about a market crash, but the next day the market opened limit up, and the calls paid off handsomely. It covered his losses for the entire year. He would have sold the trade at a $10,000 loss, but couldn't find a buyer."
