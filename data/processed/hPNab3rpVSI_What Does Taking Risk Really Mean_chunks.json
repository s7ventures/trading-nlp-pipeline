  "Risk on and risk off are determined by volatility expansion and contraction. Risk on means taking more risk, buying stocks, and possibly riskier stocks.",
  "Buying growth stocks is riskier, while moving to risk-off means taking money off the table and shifting to more conservative, defensive stocks in the equity market."
