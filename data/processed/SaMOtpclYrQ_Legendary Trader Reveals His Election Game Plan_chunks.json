  "What is your game plan for today? Will it be any different than any other day? This is my 11th presidential election in the trading business, and I believe every election day is the same. My plan is to flatten out positions, keep the desired risk, adjust trades as needed, and close or neutralize any irrelevant trades.",
  "I focus on specific trades for my wrist, cross my fingers, and hope for success."
