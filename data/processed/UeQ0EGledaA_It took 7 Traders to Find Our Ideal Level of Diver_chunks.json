  "reliability and diversification reliability and diversification let's take a look and see where the research team went on this one today it's a pretty heavy piece SO trading is about accepting R trading is about accepting risk in exchange for probable profits that's okay that's a that's a little bit of a stretch sometimes y perhaps the most long-term successful approach is to diversify using a mixture of assets so these risks offset each other I mean that's one way you can diversify is is",
  "I mean that's one way you can diversify is is underlying another way you can diversify is different strategies another way you get different durations other ways there's a few other things but let's for now focus on just underlines according to probability the risk as literally measured by standard deviation should Reduce by a factor of the square root of the number of independent trades cross underlying correlations can eat into those theoretical advantages so in practice how does trading",
  "advantages so in practice how does trading using a mixture of underlyings compar to sticking to a favorite why do I think this is not not going to be easy um we used 15 years worth of data we used three different underlyings the spy iwm and q's we considered trading 45 days to expiration 16 Delta strangles same as we always do but here's the thing we looked at seven different Traders right paying attention I'm trying to seven different Traders three traded one particular underlying three used a",
  "traded one particular underlying three used a buying power reduction even mixture of two underlyings and and and then they would let's see so for the purposes of the study we imagine fractional contracts were available that's to make it all even and then um sorry three who used a mixture of an even mixture of two underlyings and then one we used a buying power mixture of the three let me see this for a second one used a buying power even mixture of the three the other one used a buying power",
  "of the three the other one used a buying power even mixture of two underlyings okay okay then we just fra we just fractionalized It We examined the buying power results as a percentage of the buying power voted and then we repeated the analysis using 20 30 20 and 30 Delta strangles as well as 50 Delta straddles I'm gonna take the one with three doing the best so there were three traders who used one particular a those are guys they're going to be the losers right I think so there are three",
  "to be the losers right I think so there are three traders who used an even mixture of two underlines okay and then there's one Trader who used all three even got that okay kinda kind of John he's kind of got that we're ready for the let's get into the you got it come on this stuff's Child's Play for me right I write this stuff in my sleep um no this all these are hard so first one we're look at is we're going to do the 16 Delta strangle for all of the above um so we have the spy iwm and q's",
  "of the above um so we have the spy iwm and q's that's that's using that's that's three Traders picking one underline right that's what that is then there's the spy and iwm the spy and q's and this iwm and q's that's the other three Traders using two of the three right okay and then there's the third Trader using all three evenly distri uted and those win percentages they're not because we've been in a bull market for the last 15 years those are pretty good mhm the average p&l as a percent of",
  "pretty good mhm the average p&l as a percent of buying power okay I at this point you're not going to get anything out of this study if you look at it just on paper other than the third line down which is the standard deviation which is your p&l divided by the buying power used and what you'll see here is those who use all three had the lowest um amount of risk that's what that column is sure those who used all three also were very at a very low carar but again not the lowest so we're going to",
  "carar but again not the lowest so we're going to go to the to the next one because these are going to be all very similar we don't have to spend a lot of time on this you guys can go back to it later on in the 20 Delta it starts to become a little bit clear and in the 20 Delta which is a bigger strangle you start to see that that when you use all three you had the lowest standard deviation of risk and you had a very high win percentage right okay we go to the next slide and you also have very",
  "we go to the next slide and you also have very low searn we're go to the 30 Delta triangle when you see this here you're like okay now this starts to make sense because everybody else's numbers get kind of high but the all three stays low the Diversified portfolios are way better than than the individual portfolios and they have a way lower sear but again the numbers aren't that crazy on all these not that that far off John next slide please so the next one's going to be the straddles when you",
  "the next one's going to be the straddles when you look at the straddles which is kind of the a little bit towards that maybe the heaviest amount of risk you can see that um the standard deviation which is how much risk are you taking because this is really the only way we can we can break this whole thing down when you talk about risk the lowest amount of risk is when you Diversified into all three the amount of money you made is kind of the same what you would have thought from the very",
  "same what you would have thought from the very beginning and that's why you asked which is what you would have thought from the very beginning we have six different portfolios up here which are not as Diversified as all three spies iwm Q's they all did okay iwm and spies spy and q's and iwm and q's all of them did okay but the standard deviation was the lowest when you used even distribution of all three it's pretty good pretty good because it's it's just a validation I'm surprised it wasn't",
  "it's just a validation I'm surprised it wasn't more wider you know what I mean mean a bigger difference yeah bigger difference between the two yep surprised maybe if you if you compare it to using any one of the individuals it's pretty big when you compare it to the other two it's kind of not that big MH meaning the the other three the the the mixture of the two it's just marginally better Diversified Traders had significantly lower month-to-month variation in their pnls as well as more mild",
  "variation in their pnls as well as more mild bad months as represented by sear for example the per buying power reduction risk involved in trading a mixture of three straddles was slightly lower than using a single 30 Delta strangle so of course in the end whichever underlying wound up being the most profitable and iwm in this case exclusively was the most overall profitable approach but we don't know which one that'll be beforehand of course sure so unless you have a strong assumption based on",
  "so unless you have a strong assumption based on underlying using a diversified array of Trades will help you see more consistent results and more and more mild losers help you see clearly saof"
