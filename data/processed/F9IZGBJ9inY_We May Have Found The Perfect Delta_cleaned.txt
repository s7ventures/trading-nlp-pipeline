we're usually in that Delta of about 20 10's a little too cheap 40 is too high 30 is possible if we' like to go directional on one side but for the most part we're kind of stuck around that 20 area if you sell a put in a call with 20 Deltas each your theoretical probability is 60 but your actual 71 when we look at this from a risk reward side it just seems to be the sweet spot for the risk that we're taking and we like that plus 70% probability of profit increas probability profit is what kind of really turns us on right yeah increasing the Delta decreases the pop it's always you take more risk you make more money
