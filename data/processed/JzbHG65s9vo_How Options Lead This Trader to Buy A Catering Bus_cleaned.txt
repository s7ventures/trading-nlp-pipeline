I looked at it like a trade and you took all the money you guys had I just saw the opportunity risky play that's risk let's go to favorite strategies my biggest strategies my favorite strategy would be the your grinder mhm over the last four or five years he's been able to generate returns between 10 and 20% yeah well somebody's selling a catering business you know nothing about cater nothing about it and you're like my wife's a good [Music] cook all right welcome everybody welcome back to another Rising Star segment looking forward to this Gary how are you good how are you excited for you to be here today because your story is a little different than most um first of all you've been trading since you were I got I got to set the background for a second you've been trading since since your early 20s early 20s yeah and you're 39 now so it's been basically since 2007 2008 in their somewhere in there yes and and you're for untasty yeah essentially yeah since we started yeah okay I I like that cuz you got the whole you know all the players you know everybody y okay got it so we like it's weird walking around here seeing everybody because like we like lifers it's good yeah it's like I know him he knows all the terminology knows all the players yeah um let's talk about just I think you told me that your dadad kind of got you into Trading yeah originally because he was trading some kind of I I honestly don't he got into yeah but he got into the Futures and we got into doing spreads and uh like cattle and Hogs and corn but he's not a farmer so he's not a farmer no but he got into catle because he had friends that are farmers you know he did so yeah maybe that maybe that's why he got into it but uh yeah yeah so I I mean it makes sense for somebody is does he live in Iowa yes makes sense for people in Iowa to get into Trader cattle and Hogs but uh um you look at them every day driving around yeah yeah so what' you do in what' you do in there like your first trade do you remember so we get into spreads and so we would do like five cattle and one month you know it's and you you buy one month and you sell another month you you're calendar rizing calendar spreads live cattle live cattle oh my God clean hogs and uh yep my first trade I lost 250 bucks I remember as in live cattle and uh it was a calendar spread it was a calendar spread yeah and you say this this sucks yeah as it is going to takes practice you know you go in thinking oh I'm going to be a millionaire of training Commodities you and then yeah it's not that easy it's not that easy yeah yeah you learn that very quick yeah um and your background educational your backgrounds in let's call it uh mechanical engineering manufacturing engineering manufacturing yeah what we loved about your story and I think that's the most important thing you know to to tell from from our perspective to Tasty um is that your your trading you know from early 20s which is exactly when I started trading everything else gave you probably a different perspective on business and on risk and that led you to make certain decisions in your life that you might not have made had you not been trading I me we never really know but my guess is you know you wouldn't have left um a cozy steady job to take a risk at starting your own business if you hadn't been comfortable taking risk right well I always wanted to do something you know so on my background I was thinking I want to start a machine shop run my own machine shop right and the opportunity came up to purchase this catering business that this gentleman was selling he was retiring and you know I was not a cook I was not a chef I didn't have any background in that at all but it just you know from my perspective I looked at it like a trade it was just like I just saw the opportunity it was just so somebody's selling a catering business you know nothing about cater open about it and you're like my wife's a good cook that's all you had that's all I had I I believed in my wife 100% she could run this thing you know with her eyes closed did she want to do it oh yeah yeah she was yeah so right away and she was an analyst somewhere she was an analyst yeah so and she said I'm going to leave my job you're going to leave your job we're going to roll the dice no kids at this point kids at this okay and you're like we're going to roll the dice and see what happens yep yep and you took all the money you guys had and basically yeah okay that's the catering that's a risky play that's risk yeah yeah the numbers made sense you know like I said I looked at it like a trade and I was like yeah just you don't know anything about catering you know nothing about caring but it's really hard business it's hard physically it's yeah and the funniest thing was we were talking before the segment you said to me I said well like what do you do and you go you go I clean a lot of dishes I wash a lot of dishes you come full circle from engineer to Traer to dishwasher yeah promoted from engineering to dishwashing that's right that's right and and he said you you were surprised what I loved is you said I'm surprised how much tasty I wash while watch while I'm washing dishes and now I trade when I'm watching dishes listen listen you are the first uh dishwasher yeah listening to Liz and Jenny washing dishes I love it um so so you start trading in 200 uh 7 2008 and obviously you know you're starting out of your business career but you've you've pretty much traded consistently for the last 15 years there 16 years I took a little break going to school yeah I took a little break but then I got back into it right after we're going to focus on your trading for the last five or six years we're going to focus on you know how how you manage your trading because you trade every day and we're going to focus on how you manage your trading with running yourit own business and how your trading gives you the confidence you know to kind of grow your own business and and build that up and at the same time you're able to manage your family your your positions watch the network solicit new clients you know maintain all these I mean cater business you guys run a small business yeah so you're doing you're doing sales and marketing well yeah yeah yeah between the business and a 5-year-old we stay busy yeah you trade multiple accounts but let's call it mostly your IRA account and let's call it you know approximately six figure IRA account okay that's it we're just going to leave it there which is a very fair representation of what you have and we're going to say the most impressive thing about Gary is that over the last four or five years he's been able to generate returns that are um while all this is going on of two three or four times risk-free rates so risk- free rates could be anywhere between you know four and 5% so two three and four times risk-free rates so somewhere between let's call it 10 and 20% in that range okay every single year consistently and to us that is exact and it's a little bit harder in IRA account because it's less Capital efficient and to us that is exactly the definition of what we're looking for for people um um consistency no like one hit wonders yeah um just consistency and uh people that are active MH and one of the things you mentioned me which was interesting you said you know um your wife has a like an old 401k from her last job and that drives you crazy it's like it's it's a you know it's a choice of mutual funds or whatever it is yep so it's one of those targeted uh targeted date you know thoughts and bonds yeah it changes over time yeah yeah it drives me nuts drives me nuts too yeah so let's talk about favorite strategies my favorite strategies would be like in my IRA my biggest my biggest strategies my favorite strategy would be the cupboard call so it's it's my biggest position right now I'm in the Russell and that's my biggest position so are you mostly doing like cover calls and stuff against in index and indexes and ETFs against individual stocks against I I usually stick with the ETFs yeah with the big positions like you prefer ETFs but you also trade you're you trade Commodities too yeah any any you know like just yesterday uh toward the end of the day I put a little position on Silver that was an ETF though but but I have traded silver as well the Futures but anywhere I see an opportunity yeah you Bas the definition of an opportunity you is what like like what what would generate a trade you know idea to you I I'm just looking at like a price extreme in that's what I do you know so you know that's that's what I do well yeah no surprise I watch you day so uh feel like we looked at bonds and you know I just thought Bonds were oversold but yields were too so I got a little I got a little long bonds you know right and same thing with silver and you're able to able to keep keep your size in check yes so when I'm when I'm doing these other trades I'm usually doing like the zebra or I do a p man's cover call or like a p man's cover put or something like that or vertical are you usually leaning a little bit long as or or it doesn't matter to it doesn't really matter like right now I'm short um I tend to be more long I guess than anything but um with the smaller trades I'm it's all over the Bap sometimes I'm long short neutral as you become more successful and become more active how's your training changed I would say it's it's definitely gotten um less emotional and it's gotten more mechanical so uh I have the mechanics like in the cupboard calls I'm I just really focus on the call and I'm rolling when I'm taking profits I'm rolling it down or rolling it up up up and out um whereas when I first started out you know I put a position on and as soon as it was down a little bit I I take it off you know right it far more emotional but but I kept all my positions doing like iron condors and verticals you know I kept everything real small sry how aggressive are you with existing positions like making adjustments or whatever it is um I look for the 50% so like if I'm in let's say if I'm Russell and it's going down bu up close to 50% and that call I'll roll that call down um sometimes though it just depends like if I put a position on and the next day it's up 20% I might it might just I might take you off take a profit yeah how many positions do you think you carry at at any one time four 3 four five somewhere in there 3 four five yeah so relativ that's between my IRA and then my personal account you know my smaller Tasty Bites yeah smaller account yeah and how much of your capital do you use uh I'm using them quite a bit in my IRA cuz I I buy the shares so and I know that's not the most efficient way of doing it but uh well in Ira it doesn't really matter whether you sell the put or buy the ships it's the same thing yeah right yeah but I mean you could do I can I could go in there and load up like zebras or something you know yeah you could pursue Futures and do that but but I like owning the shares in that in that account so like do you get mad at yourself when you lose oh yeah you do okay good yeah good do you know anybody else that watch this tasty my dad yeah your dad yeah okay he may have been the one that turned me on to you guys too oh that's all I say he discovered you guys on YouTube or something I don't know but I don't know oh you got you've been with us since the beginning so can't he you that much long that much before that yeah when you put positions on how do you know when to take them off uh that's just the mechanics of to take it off 50% okay so you pretty much stick to that I stick to that um the stock positions by own a stock and it goes against me I just in these ETFs I'm not really worried about it going to zero so I just kind of holds it you know and yeah I just manage I just focus on the co and rolling the call down wait till they ultimately go up yeah I mean if you're long I got 20 something years but I'm assuming in 20 years you know it'll it'll be okay yeah I assume I don't like that I I don't like that approach but I can't I can't think of things like that but yeah do you think that there's in advantage of living in an area where there's like a different kind of uh knowhow with respect to different Commodities like you started off saying like first trade was in cattle and Hogs or something you know but could be corn wheat soybeans I don't think there's really an advantage CU I don't think you know anything but I'm just curious you know it this just it makes you think you're in that belt yeah when you're driving around and you see the corn growing in the in the cattle I guess it just makes you kind of think about the markets where's the stuff going where's it ending up if do you ever think why why don't I just do this fulltime yeah every day like you're watching a dish you're yeah I'm watching dishes and I'm thinking yeah I should just be doing this both time okay I was just curious because because I'm thinking that that's that's how my mind would work and I'm just thinking of that yeah it's a lot easy yeah yeah yeah yeah you don't to get I mean Yeah well yeah you don't have to get up at 3: in the morning to to cook bacon right yeah right the my limit is capital how much you limits Capital yeah what you have right now is um something that's very steady and consistent how do you parlay this into a different form of wealth creation if there's such a thing or you know do you just continue on you know for the next 10 years your GR ER mhm which is there's nothing wrong with that I I spent that's a good way to put it well I spent my my whole career that way just ring it out every year and I'm pretty happy I did yeah you know and I'm just curious if that's the way you think about yourself yeah yeah that's a good way to put it yeah okay I think long term you know eventually we'll probably sell the business you know and retire so I have this the 309 you know yeah good yeah you know me in 30 years yeah yeah caring is a hard business so you know I give it or five years maybe oh yeah no it's yeah and then what and then I just rifled on I guess do you just do you look at your existing positions and go oh I have a position on in XYZ in in ABC D or do I or do you say I have a strategy on in you know a different strategy in ABCD like I'm trying to get an idea of how do you how do you make a decision on like what you're going to do next strategically it comes down to so so like in my IRA I have my core strategy which is going to be the stocks sell the calls so that's going to be the Russell or the S&P you know I was in the S&P for a while and then I moved to Russell um but then the strategy kind of depends on like how big I want to get so I kind of differentiate between uh the core portfolio and that strategy and then the other guys it depends if I'm long or short you know so like I do the zebras trying to trying keep capital and you're trying to reserve as much cash I mean Capital efficiency is really the key to kind of especially in an IRA camp but Capital efficiency is the key to allowing you to do whatever it is yeah it just depends on how bullish I am or bearish you know or like a zebra is a great way to get really long something you yeah mimicking 100 shares yeah sure sure and when you think about that um do you have certain Capital limitations on a per trade basis or is it just what it is what it is it is what it is yeah I'm kind of looking holistic Al at the portfolio I totally understand that that that's the way I would think of it as well yeah um do you have a um do you trade differently in your individual margin account than you do in your IRA account I tend to do more of the the the verticals and zebras than the individual just ver you mean yeah okay yeah I think I do have one stock that I'm it's like a $7 stock that I'm selling calls against in there and my personal individual margin account and then I own some ethereum and and uh what are you gonna do different in 2025 I could probably use Futures more and you know and for instead of being in like the Russell ETF you know iwm I could probably do the Futures it's a little more Capital efficient you could use the the problem is that you would have to trade the micro futures um and then you'd have to write IW I'm against it so you don't really save any money it's not it's more efficient I think even after it's all said and done to use the stock okay in in those cases unless you're using the bigger contract yeah but then you run the risk of like notional inefficiency yeah yeah that's what scares me a little bit but um are you doing any kind of exotic spreads at all or no no everything's covered everything's yeah no naked right now okay well I guess I own a little ethereum so just for fun really a little little ether yeah I was actually spreading that off I was I was buying The Ether and then I was selling the little little Futures Contract with it the little micro you know it's real just playing small it's so tiny but I was playing around with that are there certain um ETFs that you think are a little bit um maybe more customer friendly to trade so I liked the Russell because why it was 200 bucks a share so like in my case we want to buy the shares that's far more reasonable than you know spy at $600 plus it has higher volatility yeah and it has better volatility get a little more bank for your buck is that in the covering call space yeah yep exactly so that's one that I like yeah are there any other underlying so that's one ETF are there anything else that you think is you know interesting from that perspective for the ETFs um I'll be in TLT I'll be in SLV um I was in last year is is it uh xlk yeah that's the technology sector technology that's a tough one it's hard yeah I was only in it I mean I I timed it perfect God speed yeah it was a little luck a little skilled I guess I don't know a tough one it it moved my way and I took my money and I was like yeah I'm done with this cuz you're right when you've established the position do you ever add to the position what are your some of your discipline SKS so like in my IRA if I want to own something own shares and I just want to own it for a while um um like here in December we had the big sell off right yeah I was in the Russell and I made a lot of money on my calls on that down move so you lost money in the Russell yeah I losing money in the Russell but I made a lot of money in the realized gains of the calls so I took some of that premium and just bought a few more shares in the Russell doubl down a little bit yeah yeah so it's it's like my way of of uh dollar cost averaging kind of you know got it I take what the market gives me you know I take that money from the call and I can I could buy a few more shares got it so so I do have a I do that every once in a while yeah what would be the advice that you would give someone that not necessarily want to open their bu open their own business because that goes on saying but what would be the advice you give to someone who wants to start trading ultimately to potentially you know figure out how to open their own business yeah I would say just start small just get in there and that's the way that's the way I had to do it I mean you can read books till you're blue in the face you know you can watch tasty live but until actually get in there and and start putting the positions on and how hard was it to for you to how hard was it for you to translate from what we talked about in air to actually put it into practice at first it was difficult yeah because it was more emotional when I it started I didn't really know what I was doing and I I'd put a trade on and something would happen it' go against me and I I didn't really understand like why am I losing money here or something and and yeah i' close it but but I stayed real small you know that was that was the key I think I don't know if people really understand how important it is to stay small because it keeps you in the game until you learn it and then when you learn it you're like okay thank God I stayed small yeah I think that's one thing I I learned uh even before tasty when I was doing the spreads and cattle and Hogs and stuff was you know that was the one thing we did right was that every position I I did was a spread and so it was a smaller risk do you know that I've never traded cattle yeah I don't think I I you know we have it on a platform and I mean maybe I traded it once but I don't think I ever traded cattle so like I oh uh I don't have any feel for that I think I've tried lean Hogs once and I was oh boy I think it was okay but no I don't remember really the uh the commissions and fees and stuff it's the fees from the exchanges are higher on those guys they're crazy and the expirations are weird yeah and there's a lot of weird stuff yeah um so I kind of stay away from that stuff yeah and at all costs I'm going to wrap up with just asking you if if you do you feel like at the end of whatever the fiscal year is the end of the year you know for you f January 30 U December 31st whatever um do you look at your returns yeah like look at your returns oh this is great I can't wait to oh yeah I got it all mapped down on a spreadsheet oh you do oh yeah yeah cuz I want to know like if you look at the returns and go okay I got to do a little better this year I got to do this this this I have it mapped out like 20 years of you know 15% return and that's what I want to make every year you know that's kind of my goal and so I compare well that's good that's a good goal to have yeah see I like what I like about you is steadiness yeah yeah yeah the consistency and the steadiness and the willingness to turn you know trading into a kind of a motivation to do your own thing as an entrepreneur I mean we're you're looking for opportunity you want to capitalize opportunity for sure and I think as a Trader it's it's the exact same thing you know you I look at opportunity and I'm indiff you know to what wherever wherever that opportunity is and I want want to capitalize on opportunity and uh I think that spilled over into my life and my business cuz I wasn't a chef you know I mean you know if I wasn't trading I probably would have looked at that opportunity and I would have said well I'm not a cook I'm not a chef I don't want to cater I would have looked at that opportunity I mean said I'm not a cook I'm not a chef yeah yeah but I looked at it a little differently and I said well you know it's just like if I'm bouncing around from silver or equities or futures or crypto it's opportunity opportunity so I think it was I think it was good practice Gary thank you so much that was a great talk that was really interesting um your story is super cool and appreciate you sharing it thank you yeah
