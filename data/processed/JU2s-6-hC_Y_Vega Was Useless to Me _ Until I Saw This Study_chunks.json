  "we're doing something today called evaluating Vega what we're going to look at is theoretical versus realize risk I'm G tell you where we're going with this in a second Vega measures the change in an options value when implied volatility goes up by 1% so most of our trades are short Vega meaning that we want implied vola to go down in order for us to profit we just sell pre we're just premium sellers um a bigger Vega means that we have more theoretical opportunity from IV contraction but also",
  "opportunity from IV contraction but also more theoretical risk from IV expansion so the most common pure short volatility trade that we use is is a strangle the Delta of a strangle determines how much vager risk there is the larger the Delta the more risk or opportunity we have from an implied volatility move bigger the credits more money we can make it's more of the credits less money we make but higher probability of profit is there a Delta that we can get the most amount of theoretical",
  "that we can get the most amount of theoretical opportunity with the least amount of realized risk in other words how do we optimize this trade that's a question um how would we op is there a Delta where we can get the most amount of theoretical opportunity with the least amount of realized risk 27 and a half you're going to go to the 27 and a half Delta I'm going to give you a hint can you want a hint it's closer to 50 I'm going to give you a hint go ahead it's a trick question ah it's going to",
  "go ahead it's a trick question ah it's going to be closer to 50 I'm gonna say 27 and a half is closer to 50 I don't care about you H it's a trick question I don't care okay so is there a Delta where we can get the most amount amount of theoretical opportunity with the least amount of real the options are perfectly priced there's probably going to be no theoretical anything buto so we did a study four uh 2014 to present 10 years 45 days to expiration we looked at 16 20 30 and 40 Deltas we",
  "expiration we looked at 16 20 30 and 40 Deltas we observed the historical volatility of p&l with manag in 21 days and the current Vega in the Feb 21st cycle theoretical risk award forward and then closest to 45 days so we're just looking at everything mhm let's go next Slide the first one so we said with higher Delta strangles we get higher theoretical risk opportunity for Vega but also higher realized risk so wi Delta maximizes the Vega opportunity while minimizing the actual risk in Cur and",
  "while minimizing the actual risk in Cur and so we look down below we see at 16 Deltas we have um a smaller Vega there have smaller volatility risk because the strikes are wider and we have a smaller volatility of p&l which means we also make less money at 20 Deltas goes up a little at 30 delt goes up a little more at 40 delt goes up a little bit more and correspondingly the volatility of the p&l the risk goes up accordingly they almost look about three times as much across the board there I",
  "three times as much across the board there I don't think there's anything you can pull pull across I mean it be really hard to look at those numbers and see that there's an advantage anywhere right okay so what we're going to do is we're going to go to the next slide and here we're going to say no matter how wide our strikes are the amount of Vega we are short per unit of historical risk is virtually the exact same this suggests that historical realized risk and theoretical risk opportunity",
  "realized risk and theoretical risk opportunity increase proportionately with Delta what's so interesting about this is you look at spy you go all the way back to 2005 the realized risk per unit of theoretical risk that's Vega plus volatility of p&l is the same across the board regardless of what strike you use what this is suggesting is what Tony just said a minute ago which is options are so are priced so theoretically perfectly and they scale across symmetrically across all the different",
  "across symmetrically across all the different strikes that it doesn't matter what strike you necessarily use right now it it might for probability of profit of course it might for the amount of risk that you want to take but when we talk about the theoretical risk versus the opportunity it's exactly the same across the board it's a good way of putting it nicely done 16 20 30 and 40 Deltas are all the same so for takeaways Vega is a Greek that can be used as a proxy for theoretical risk reward",
  "be used as a proxy for theoretical risk reward When comparing the Vega to the realized risk we see that the ratio of Vega to realize risk is the same no matter what strangle you sell this suggests that theoretical risk reward and actual risk and the actual risk incurred are direct directly proportional what's so interesting about this is it essentially says you know what do whatever pop choose whatever strikes you want based on the pop you want that's your probability profit how much you want",
  "that's your probability profit how much you want to manage things like that but your theoretical risk reward and your actual risk are direct directly proportional"
