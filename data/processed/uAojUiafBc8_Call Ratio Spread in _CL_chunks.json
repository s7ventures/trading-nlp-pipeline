  "market today with all four major indices in the red. The Russell is showing the weakest performance with a nearly 1% drop, followed by the Dow. Consider looking for short opportunities in these weaker indices.",
  "The market is opening slightly lower with the S&P trading at 5742, just off its highs. Volatility is increasing, currently at 90 cents and trading up to 2125. This suggests potential weakness in the market. I am avoiding equities for now.",
  "I have been focusing on trading equities on the podcast recently, trying to capitalize on expanding volatility. I implemented an Iron Condor strategy to mitigate the impact of volatility. However, a 1x3 ratio spread in Buu has resulted in losses of about a dollar and a half. I now have a 120 strangle position after adjusting from a 1x3 call ratio.",
  "1x3 call ratio spread on 110-120, added 20 strangle. Defending the trade put on for around $6. Trades documented on 10/26.",
  "On 1026, we duplicated a trade at 170, now trading at 661. I am out about a dollar and a half on this trade, but would have been out almost $45 if we did nothing. With the market going lower, I am looking at oil (forward slcl).",
  "Oil has been rallying for 4 days, currently at $73.12. Consider trading oil Futures, which are barrels of oil. Make sure you understand the product before trading.",
  "Oil futures options have span margining, which may be unfamiliar to some traders. The current tension in the Middle East is impacting the market. Considering buying the rumor and selling the news strategy.",
  "Buy the rumor, sell the news is my preferred trading strategy. I am looking to trade in November with 43 days until expiration. The monthly implied volatility in November is 50, and the product is trading at 52.56, which is lower than the front month. I anticipate the front month to expire in about a week, making November the new front month.",
  "The front month contract will change to Z4. Options are already priced and expire to these Futures. Let's look at November with 43 days. Monthly implied volatility is around 60. I prefer to have time on my side for this trade.",
  "I will go with a ratio spread by buying the 15 Delta option. You can change the columns to open interest if desired. There is plenty of open interest available.",
  "I'm buying the 90 call and selling the 97.5 call in a ratio spread. I'm slightly bearish on oil. I entered the trade for a $300 credit, which is now trading for $340.",
  "For $340 in credit, consider trading CL like SPX. CL is 10 times the size of what you're used to seeing. The mid price is currently 33 cent credit. If oil continues to rise, selling an extra call can be beneficial.",
  "We are trading 97.5 for a net credit of 33 cents. I was filled one penny off mid price, which is common for oil-related products and futures options. The market is 2 cents wide for the 90 calls and 3 cents wide for the 97.5 calls. This mid price is accurate within a 2-3 cent range.",
  "When trading options with wide bid-ask spreads, be cautious with your mid price. Consider going above mid price and adjusting your order down. Expect to get filled at 32 or 31 cents. Keep an eye on volatility as the market moves.",
  "This trade moves a lot and uses $3,700 in buying power in an IRA account. It is less than other spreads that use around $5,000 in buying power. Please be cautious and avoid clicking on other trades solely based on buying power.",
  "Buying power with span margining can change. The trade has a 99% probability of profit, with a break-even point above 105. Oil hasn't surpassed 105 recently, so making new highs in 45 days is unlikely. Adjustments may be made to the Delta by selling puts or other strategies. The Delta is currently minimal.",
  "The Delta is currently 0.005, which is minimal. Multiplying by 10 gives the real Delta. There is a slight Delta on the short side, making me bearish on this product. The Theta is $25 a day in data decay. Buying power is $33,700. I will move the $75 wide spread closer to at the money to demonstrate the buying power.",
  "If you're trading in a regular margin account, you'll use about $2,000 in buying power. In an IRA account, you'll use around $3,700. The product is trading at $72.40.",
  "I will buy the 70 and sell the 77.5 call options for a 14 cent debit. The buying power required is $110,000. The buying power will increase as the options get closer to being at the money and closer to expiration.",
  "The buying power can increase up to around $10,000 with a regular margin account, which is double the initial amount. Futures options have many nuances to consider.",
  "Learning about Futures options and margining can be helpful for leveraging large contracts. If you are used to trading small spreads, be cautious when considering larger contracts as the risk increases significantly.",
  "Buying power can expand to double, from $5,000 to $10,000. This strategy is for larger traders. Consider trading iron condors for a 30-33 cent credit. This can be done in an IRA account at Tasty Trade.",
