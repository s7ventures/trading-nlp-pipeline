  "I play meme stocks by buying long call calendars for small debits. I struggle with deciding when to exit a call calendar spread that moves past my strikes. A call calendar spread is the same strike intra-month spread. You want the stock to reach your strike price and stay there or slowly move to your short strike.",
  "If the stock moves quickly, there may not be much you can do. Research shows that selling at 25% of the purchase price is common. Calendar spreads involve low risk and low reward."
