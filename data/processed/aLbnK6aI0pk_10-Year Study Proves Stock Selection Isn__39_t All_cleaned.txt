why strategy over product why strategies over product so in our research we consistently emphasize the significance of focusing on strategies rather than individual products we aim to illustrate that in liquid and efficient markets the the controllable elements across different products are implied volatility of notional value as opposed to the unpredictable nature of price movements one of the things that I talk about all the time in different lectures that I give and in different um discussions and things that we teach just in general about entrepreneurship and business and trading is most important thing you can do Mr Batista control the things you can control the things that you can't control like what is the stock going to do today or tomorrow or next week you have no control over that what you do have control over is the strategy that you're going to use the strikes you're going to select the duration you're going to do the current level volatility all those things are under your control MH that's control what you can control is really what you're saying here it's the entry for in life worry about the things that you can control don't worry about the things you can't control there's nothing you can do just worry about the things you can control this segment intends to update and illustrate how this strategic mindset can be applied to liquid products and the reason we care about liquid products is be care we care about you being able to get in and out and we care about the derivatives pricing to be efficient across various asset class classes prompting the question why prioritize strategy over product let's go to the next slide so we did a study um four different underlying spy Q's TLT and gold 10 years of research 60 Delta triangles and we also shorted the 30 Delta put as a separate test we looked at 45 days to expiration manag in 21 days because we know the short 30 Delta put performed really well over the last 10 years since 2014 we compared the average profit as a percent of the premium collected we looked at the win rate the worst loss as a percent of the premium collected and the average p&l as a percent of buying power so for our claim of why strateg over product and product indifference to be considered valid we need to see the following in the results since the Delta of the strangles is all the same the win rates must also be similar and the size of the average profit and the percent of the premium and the worst loss per of the premium should be similar across all underlyings since products do vary by implied volatility and notional value looking at profit and loss as a premium as a percent of the premium collected normalizes the implied volatility and the notional differences takes those right out of the study so regardless of the underlying with slight variance we tended to see the win rates between 70 and 73% of the 16 Delta triangle and the average profit between 7 and 10% is a percent of the buying power um the average loss between 9 and 15 times and the average pnl is a percent of buying Power Ranges to 310 to 510 of percent this is all just going to this is all going to validate the whole concept of this is why we choose strategy over product because the product the cued the Spy the bonds and gold it didn't really matter the win rate was all the same the average profit as a percent of Premium was pretty close to the same the worst loss pretty close to the same and the average p&l as a percent of buying power all really close to the same now could those vary from year to year could the worst loss as a percent of the premium because because that probably happened on August 5th be be something different in TLT and gold in 2025 of course but the point here is it's close enough and strategy over Direction too it's just so much easier to do the strategy than it is to pick the direction yes so even by selling a short even by selling the short putut it falls the suit we tended to see the win rates between 73 and 77% this a big put the 30 Delta put and the average profit between 16 and 21% again because we've been in a bull market so when you look here the win rates 77 77 73 73 I mean and the average profit as a percent of the premium obviously it's going to be much higher in this case because the market just kept going higher but and the worst loss is is going to be very similar because that wouldn't affect that one big down move but the average p&l is a percent of buying power significantly higher to one and a half percent 2% 1% 1% but that's just because all you do is sell puts in a bull in a be in a sell puts in a bull market the point here being that the spice Q's TLT and gold were basically all the same let's go to next slide these findings strongly support the prioritization of strategies over individual products and the concept of product indifference despite the significant differences among the assets studied such as varied prices implied volatilities correlations and Market exposures but selling premium with a fixed Delta on all assets results in win rates average profits and average losses that differ by only a small percentage across all underlines this is really interesting again because this is what we Stress Control the stuff you can control optimize your mechanics do what we know is the is is the most mechanical and most optimal thing to strategically to do and don't worry about the underlying product those can be chosen by just levels of implied volatility so some of the takeaways the fundamental principle of emphasizing strategy over individual products in trading and indifference of product involves selecting underlying assets based on preferred notional size implied volatility correlation and I would also say liquidity to this this is essential because the long-term profitability of a trade is determined more by strategy of of the then by the specific product excluding short-term price variability when the same strategy was applied to four different underlying classes each with distinct implied volatilities correlations notional values and profitability metrics were consistently similar across all it's just listen this is what we do
