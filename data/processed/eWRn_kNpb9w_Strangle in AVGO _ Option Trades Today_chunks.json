  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the B Batista and I have a trade idea for you today October 15th 2024 and I'm right here in downtown Chicago right here in the Batcave but like I always do let's take a look at the market see what's going on before we find this trade even the S&P is down $19.50 you can see they're about $10 10 handles or 10 points off of their lows well off of their highs obviously NASDAQ down 200 and you got the Dow down19 those are the three indices that are down you can",
  "those are the three indices that are down you can see the NASDAQ is the weakest of the group and you've got the Russell up 11 bucking it to the upside volatility up 45 cents just off of his highs of 1910 uh by about 1520 cents volatility creeping and staying bid maybe it's the election season maybe volatility is percolating because the Market's gotten a little bit too frothy let's take a look at what's going on for the next couple of days and see what happens bonds finally catch a bid they're",
  "what happens bonds finally catch a bid they're up 105 good volatility in the bonds if you're looking to do something and selling premium uh in there what am I going to look at today well like I always do or like I usually do I like to go to the ivx 5day change what is this you ask I'm glad you asked this is the volatility of each product's net change over the last 5 days meaning their implied volatility so you'll notice spy has an IV rank it's implied volatility it's monthly implied volatility",
  "volatility it's monthly implied volatility that would be this number right here in the uh right hand side this number when compared to itself gives you a little bit of a rank let's go back to spy from a scale of 1 to 100 this volatility in spy being around well let's just call it uh 18 1920 uh is about on a scale of 0 to 100 about the 35 percentile meaning uh good high not the best at least in this kind of Market environment you'll notice here there are many stocks that have higher implied",
  "there are many stocks that have higher implied volatility many of them are going to have earnings looming I like to get rid of the earnings and not see that a stock that I found and just to save you from dragging along avgo when I go down here to the bottom the very very bottom has earnings coming but not until after expiration you'll see them here on Def December 5th you'll notice here that avgo its IV rank is 44 higher than the market I'm talking about spy and then the ivx 5day change is",
  "talking about spy and then the ivx 5day change is actually up 1% over the last 5 days when volatility has been going lower as of late when you look at the volatility overall Market you can see over the last 5 days even though it's catching a bid today it's been going lower so let's take a look at avgo if you want to you know it as broadcom I know it is avgo it's had its first down tick today down around $7 and change and you can notice here uh volatility again creeping up just another way to",
  "volatility again creeping up just another way to look at it you can get this on your own uh platform on tasty trade uh by going into the uh settings and changing to the ivr high low that's what I have there the high being 47 for the day the low being 41 presently it's 44 let's take a look at avj avgo and what we're going to do here I'm going to play this straight by the numbers now November 31 days we like to go 45 days to expiration that's the kind of the optimal time frame you might say well",
  "kind of the optimal time frame you might say well there's options with 45 days and has earnings on December 5th that's that line This is November 29th options why don't we go to these well when you go to these you'll notice that there's markets are 20 cents wide 30 cents wide not a lot of volume when you look at the uh not a lot of open interest on these options I like to trade things that have a higher uh open interest a much better bid ask Market let's see in avgo what it would be like in",
  "Market let's see in avgo what it would be like in November because I can't trade December you know what with 45 days to go um December's on the board for me November's still on the board but a year about a day or two away from going off the board in November so I'm going to put this trade in November for today another interesting thing I saw November has a 45% monthly implied volatility December which would be affected by the earnings the December 20th options with earnings coming on December",
  "20th options with earnings coming on December 5th has a 46 and a half 46.7% uh monthly imply volatility all things being equal with no earnings risk this volatility is elevated in November at least when I compare it to December and an earnings event give me more and more reason why I wanted to stay in November well because I'm not having time on my side that's almost like a double negative but since I don't have time on my side 31 days usually these positions Take 2 to 3 weeks to come to",
  "these positions Take 2 to 3 weeks to come to fruition meaning making 25 to 50% uh on the on the overall spread I'm going to go a little further out give myself a little bit more room to be right you'll notice here that the open interest is in the thousands across all the lines um in avgo much better than what we saw with the 45 days so I'm going to go to the 152 puts that's basically a standard deviation that line right here is a standard Dev Dev ation or you can go to the Delta the Delta's you",
  "ation or you can go to the Delta the Delta's you know between 13 and 15 is a standard deviation I'm going to sell the 152 puts just going right to the math model just going to the standard deviation here I'm going to go up to that line I'm going to the 198 call I'm doing this whole spread wow it's already moved pretty good I did it for $355 uh maybe if you had the tasty trade platform and you had been watching you can you go down to the follow page and you'll notice I have this trade already in",
  "and you'll notice I have this trade already in here I'm going to go to Bob the trader because that's me I did this at 10:13 uh when the stock was right here it really hasn't moved uh the ivr has moved down by only a point but yet it's moved this spread significantly I did this spread at $3.55 and I'm explaining to you here that it's just a strangle at one standard deviation but maybe volatility expand a little bit in here where the stock will move a little bit and you'll be able to get filled",
  "a little bit and you'll be able to get filled at a similar price anyway three $55 for me let's take a look at this overall trade it has a good pop of 75% my Theta Decay for the risk I'm taking now this is in an IRA account I wanted to to show you that an IRA account you could do this type of trade even though it's going to use significantly more buying power $155,000 now in a margin account it's going to use significantly less probably closer to $22,000 in a margin account but yes in tasty",
  "to $22,000 in a margin account but yes in tasty trade you can do this trade you can have a naked call option as long as you have the buying power which is basically fully margined at $155,000 again if you're in a margin account it'll be significantly less more like one10 the size let's call it $2500 to $3,000 in buying power $16 in Theta Decay it has a little bit of short Delta 5 because I went to the one standard deviation I did not and you could if you wanted to go to the same uh delta",
  "could if you wanted to go to the same uh delta neutral type tra trade go up to the 200 or the 205 I'm sticking with the 198s I'm just going with that one standard deviation on the overall Market plus with volatility percolating a little bit and the stock taking a little bit of a breather to the downside today I think it's nice to stay at that one standard deviation you'll notice here that this line this uh brownish line is the expected move the expected move so I'm outside well outside the",
  "the expected move so I'm outside well outside the expected move to one standard deviation I got filled at $3.55 it looks like it's $347 right now I wouldn't press this trade I would wait for volatility to expand in avgo there are good markets in avgo and has good implied volatility matter of fact let's see if uh it's changed at all down here no it's still 1% uh move in avgo all right that's my trade for you guys today be careful out there be smart but you know what else you got to be you got to",
