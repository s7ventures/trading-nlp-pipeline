  "Hello, I'm Tony the B Batista with a trade idea for October 15th, 2024. The S&P is down $19.50, NASDAQ down 200, and the Dow down 19. Let's find a trade opportunity in this market.",
  "down you can see the NASDAQ is the weakest of the group, with the Russell up 11. Volatility is up 45 cents, just off its highs of 1910. Volatility is staying bid, possibly due to the election season or frothy market conditions. Bonds have finally caught a bid. Let's see what happens in the next few days.",
  "Bonds are up 105, showing good volatility. Consider selling premium. Check the IVX 5-day change for implied volatility. Spy has an IV rank for monthly implied volatility.",
  "volatility. Monthly implied volatility is ranked on a scale of 1 to 100, with SPY currently at around 18-20, placing it in the 35th percentile. This indicates moderate volatility in the current market environment compared to other stocks.",
  "There are stocks with higher implied volatility due to upcoming earnings. I prefer to avoid stocks with looming earnings. AVGO has earnings after expiration on December 5th, with an IV rank of 44, higher than the market (SPY) and IVX 5-day change.",
  "Spy's IVX 5-day change is up 1% despite overall market volatility decreasing. AVGO (Broadcom) had its first downtick today, with volatility creeping up.",
  "Volatility is increasing. You can access this information on Tasty Trade by adjusting the IVR settings to high and low. Currently, the high is 47 and the low is 41, with the present at 44. Let's analyze AVJ and AVGO using a straightforward approach based on the 45-day expiration period in November.",
  "The optimal time frame for trading options is typically around 45 days. For example, if you are looking at options with earnings on December 5th, it is best to focus on those with higher open interest and tighter bid-ask spreads. In the case of AVGO, options with more liquidity and tighter spreads may be a better choice for trading.",
  "I am considering trading AVGO in November due to the upcoming earnings in December. November has a 45% monthly implied volatility. I will place this trade in November today.",
  "20th options with earnings on December 5th have a 46.7% monthly implied volatility. This volatility is elevated in November compared to December due to the upcoming earnings event. With only 31 days until expiration, it is best to stay in November options to avoid time decay.",
  "These positions typically take 2 to 3 weeks to yield a 25 to 50% return on the overall spread. I will choose options with higher open interest, such as the 152 puts in AVGO, to give myself more room for success. This line represents a standard deviation or you can look at the Delta values.",
  "I am selling the 152 puts and buying the 198 call as part of a spread trade. The trade cost me $355.",
  "I entered this trade at 10:13 with a spread at $3.55. The stock hasn't moved much, but the spread has widened due to a slight decrease in IVR. It's a strangle at one standard deviation, with potential for volatility expansion and movement in the stock.",
  "Consider entering a trade at $55. The trade has a 75% potential return with manageable Theta Decay. This trade can be executed in an IRA account, although it will require more buying power compared to a margin account. In a margin account, the buying power needed would be around $22,000.",
  "In a margin account, you can trade a naked call option with buying power of $155,000. In a non-margin account, buying power would be around $2,500 to $3,000. Theta Decay is $16, with a short Delta of 5 at one standard deviation.",
  "If you want to trade delta neutral, consider the 200 or 205 strike. I'm sticking with the 198 strike, one standard deviation from the overall market. With volatility increasing and the stock pulling back today, it's prudent to stay at one standard deviation. The brown line represents the expected move, and I'm trading outside of it.",
  "I got filled at $3.55 for a trade outside the expected move in AVGO. The current price is $347. I would wait for volatility to expand before considering this trade. AVGO has good implied volatility. No change in AVGO's 1% move. Be careful and smart with your trades.",
