  "Traders aim to minimize risk by selling smaller Deltas, like 10 or 15 instead of 20 or 30, as market volatility and the possibility of correction increase. Two standard deviation strangles have a 95% success rate, making them appealing to traders focused on success rates.",
  "The success rate on the platform is shown by a one standard deviation dotted line and a two standard deviation line. Both strategies exceed expectations, with the two standard deviation strangles having a success rate closer to 100%.",
  "Strangles closer to 100% have a higher probability of profit. Two standard deviation strangles have a high success rate but lower average P&L.",
  "Generate a lower average P&L and return on capital for each position. In SPY, the one-two standard deviation strangles show low return on capital, high win rates, decent average P&L, and cheap premiums.",
  "What would the long-term portfolio performance be for both strategies if we simulated an equally sized account with 25% asset value allocated to each? Over 21 days, two standard deviation triangles outperform one SD strangles by 27%. The strategy excels at volatility control.",
  "standard deviation spy strangle has a reasonable expectation of return.",
  "With an 82% probability of profit, the one standard deviation SPY strangle has an annualized return of about 133% with a 17% volatility. The two standard deviations strangle has an annualized return on capital of 99.5% with an 11.5% volatility. We aim to make multiples of risk-free rates when trading, with two times the risk-free rate being the goal.",
  "a 1% return is not satisfactory given the risk involved. If the risk is consistently between 80-97%, the numbers remain the same. A one standard deviation strangle yields a 13% return, which is 2.5 times the risk-free rate. Neither of these returns are sufficient. With only 25% of the portfolio being used, consider alternative strategies.",
  "Remember, we are only using 25% of the portfolio. If we use 50%, the numbers will double to 26 and 19. The amount of money you allocate matters because it is built into these numbers. If you increase to 50%, the numbers will be five times the risk-free rates. Consider your risk tolerance.",
  "What is your risk tolerance? The best case scenario may not always be the most conservative one. Consider a more moderate or aggressive approach based on implied volatility. Iron Condors are popular for customizing risk by adjusting wingspans.",
  "higher transaction costs compared to wider wingspans. While tight wings can offer cheap trades with small maximum losses and high potential returns, they also come with lower probability of profit and higher transaction costs.",
  "Counters have lower probability of profit and narrower break evens, resulting in more losses. Small iron Condors have higher volatility in P&L, amplifying the gap between expected and actual return. It's a tough way to make a living.",
  "We are focusing on one and two standard deviations, which equates to around the 5 Delta option. These are Iron condors. We typically look at the 30 Delta option, but also consider the 15 Delta option.",
  "A 15 Delta iron condor can be risky due to low realized return on capital, especially for small accounts. Narrow iron condors can provide valuable learning experiences.",
  "narrow positions, it can be challenging to make a living and it takes longer to reach the profit target, such as 50%. To achieve success, it is important to widen the strikes in order to reach your goal.",
  "terms of iron condors to achieve similar returns as strangles takeaway number two is that iron condors can provide a good balance between risk and reward compared to strangles.",
  "To increase returns, aim for a 50% win rate in smaller trading accounts. When trading iron condors, opt for wider spreads over narrow ones for better results. Smaller delta strangles offer high success rates and volatility control but may underperform in profit and return on capital. Narrowing iron condors are cost-effective for beginners but have lower success rates and profit potential.",
  "Iron Condors cap potential profits and define risk, so using them with too small of a size can be worse long term compared to strangles. While smaller strangle strategies have benefits, they may not always yield the best returns. Balancing risk, reward, and capital is crucial."
