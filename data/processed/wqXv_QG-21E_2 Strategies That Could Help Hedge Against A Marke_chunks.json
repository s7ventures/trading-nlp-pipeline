  "strangles and iron Condors finding the right size balance as Market volatility and the possibility of Market correction increase Traders seek to minimize their Risk by improving their odds of success one way to achieve this is by selling smaller Deltas such as 10 or 20 such as 10 or 15 Deltas instead of 20 or 30 Delta options for example two standard deviation strangles have a success rate of 95% making them attractive to traders who whose main focus is success rate kind of hard to read that",
  "focus is success rate kind of hard to read that bottom line but let's go to next slide on all they're saying is on the platform the the there's a one standard deviation dotted line and then a two standard deviation line that is correct that is correct I talk about it all the time on my option trades today my podcast regarding success rate both the on SD and the 2 SD strategies exceed expectations but the success rate for the two standard deviation strangles is even better closer to 100% well",
  "strangles is even better closer to 100% well you know on a percentage basis I don't even actually know if that's that much better but it's but from a from a probability of profit standpoint that's what they're referring to so this just straight stuff we've done this a 100 times theoretical verse Real theoretical and then realized um let's go next slide so as expected two standard deviation strangles have extremely high success rate however they generate a lower average average p&l and a lower",
  "generate a lower average average p&l and a lower um return on capital for each position so just again we're just we're setting we're setting the stage um we're painting a little bit of a background here you can see in spy the one two standard deviation strangles the initial premium the average p&l the win rates and the daily return on Capital and you can see I mean the return on capital is pretty low win rates are pretty high the average p&l is decent and the premium is pretty cheap let's go",
  "decent and the premium is pretty cheap let's go next slide win ratees great so what would the long-term portfolio performance be for both strategies if we simulated an equally sized account with 25% asset Val allocated to each and man 21 days from a portfolio perspective two standard deviation triangles outperform I'm sorry underperform one SD strangles by 27% however the strategy excels at volatility control so okay now this is this is interesting because this is the question that we get a lot",
  "because this is the question that we get a lot about you know what is an expectation what a reasonable expectation of a return so the reason that we put this up here is because on spy strangles if you sell one standard deviation spy strangles um with a uh with a very high probability of profit in this case I think it was um is it 82% can you go back one slide for a second it got to 97 82 and 97 on a two 82 and 97 okay so go go back to next side Beth so with an 82% probability of profit the one",
  "Beth so with an 82% probability of profit the one standard deviation spy strangles annualize this with losses and everything else in there comes out to about 133% with a 17% volatility the two standard deviations triangle the annualized return on capital is 99.5% with an 11 um 11.5 volatility annualized volatility now you know my rules when we trade we want to make some multiple of risk-free rates that's correct two times risk-free rates or 9 and a half% is not good enough for me for the risk",
  "a half% is not good enough for me for the risk that you take right for the risk that you're taking but what about if your risk that you were taking all the time was 80 to 97% doesn't matter same stuff numbers are the same so one stand deviation strangle gives me a 13 because all the loss are built in here too gives me a 133% return which is two and a half times the risk-free rate neither of those two numbers are good enough so what do you do now remember we're only using 25% of the portfolio so",
  "remember we're only using 25% of the portfolio so if we use 50% of the portfolio oh these numbers are going to be double them 26 and and 19 right right that works sure so this is where the amount of money that you allocate matters because that's what's built into these numbers this is only 25% of your total portfolio if you get to 50 those numbers are F you know five times risk-free rates and all of a sudden you have something so you have to figure out like what's your risk tolerance yeah well",
  "out like what's your risk tolerance yeah well sometimes we show you the most conservative case and sometimes the most conservative case isn't the best case the best case might be a more moderate or aggressive case based on where implied volatility is especially like something like now let's go to the next slide so what about an iron Condor iron Condors are highly popular primarily for its ability to customize the amount of risk through adjusting the wingspans and you can see here we just kind",
  "the wingspans and you can see here we just kind of grafted it all out and you can see from 20 Deltas down to $1 wide let's go to next slide Beth theoretically tight Wings have some advantages they're cheap to trade they have a small Max loss per unit and they potentially can yield High return on investment this is all true but they have some problems um and let's go let's go to the next slide we might come back to this one in reality small iron counters have a lower probability of profit and",
  "counters have a lower probability of profit and narrower break evens resulting in a lot more losses yes you're going to lose a lot more times yes so small iron Condors have a much higher volatility in p&l which amplifies the gap between the expected um and the actual return when you look at the um width of the Wings right it's um uh it's it's a little it's a tough way to eek out a living let's put it that way it's a very tough way to you get a living now we're looking at one and two standard",
  "living now we're looking at one and two standard deviations here you you know two standard deviations you're going around the fiveish Delta option right yeah but these are these are just these are all Iron condos I know these are iron condos I I was I was just going back cuz I'm emails from people like you know we were really looking you know we look at more the 30-ish Delta option than the one and two standard deviations we do go to around the 15ish Delta which on one side might be standing",
  "15ish Delta which on one side might be standing but not on both sides what's dangerous about this what this slide shows that's kind of scary is that the realized return on capital is extremely low on very small iron condors and you're many times below risk-free rates but this is the quantry with smaller accounts too you know what I mean understand that's we're trying to show that that's trying to show there's a reason for doing small iron Condors very narrow ones which is you learn from it it's",
  "very narrow ones which is you learn from it it's tough to make a living also takes much longer for these less risky positions to reach their profit Target like 50% in this case um and that is correct so the number of days in the trade I mean if you want to get to your spot you got to widen the strikes that's all this shows you want to get to your spot you got to widen the strikes if not on the really narrow ones it's super hard almost impossible to get there finally when it comes to the",
  "to get there finally when it comes to the percentage return the wi iron condos give us more bang for the buck in the same amount of time yes they're very close to the strangle returns not exactly but much closer to the strangle returns this is even $10 wide go $20 wide you're close to the strangle returns again what we're showing here is that there's two major takeaways from this takeaway number one is that sometimes you've got to go over that 25% number to like 50 or higher especially in",
  "25% number to like 50 or higher especially in smaller accounts to get a decent return and the second thing is if you're going to do iron Condors you're not other than for engagement purposes and teaching you're not going to do much with narrow iron Condors you got to go wide smaller Delta strangles offer a high success rate and volatility control but underperform in p&l and return on Capital narrowing iron Condors are costeffective for beginners but have a low success rate and a vol p&l with",
  "but have a low success rate and a vol p&l with limited profit potential iron Condors are already capping your potential profits and defining your risk R so going too small with them is much worse in the long term compared to going too small with strangles and while smaller strangle strategies provide certain benefits they may not always yield the best returns highlighting the importance of balancing risk and reward and the amount of capital that you use I cannot stress that enough"
