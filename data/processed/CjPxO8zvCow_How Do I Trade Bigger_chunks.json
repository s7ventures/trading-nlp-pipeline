  "I recommend scaling up slowly by increasing the width of your defined risk trades from $3 to $5 to $5 to $10, or even $10 to $20 for an iron condor. Consider using synthetic strangles or selling naked puts or calls. The key is to focus on proving your strategy as you transition from a smaller to a larger account.",
  "The most important thing when starting out in trading is to prove your concept. Begin by scaling up slowly, widening strikes instead of adding more contracts to increase risk. Once you can handle the additional risk, continue to scale up by widening strikes and eventually adding more contracts."
