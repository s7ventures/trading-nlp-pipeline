  "Dispersion trading involves trading on the difference in volatility between different assets or time periods. It is possible for retail traders to engage in dispersion trading, typically through strategies like calendar spreads or diagonal spreads.",
  "Retail investors typically do not engage in dispersion trading due to its capital inefficiency. This strategy is commonly used by prop firms and quant firms to flatten their books or take on directional trades. It involves trading two separate products that require capital for both, which may not be practical for retail investors.",
  "Self-directed retail investors may not effectively trade in a capital-efficient manner."
