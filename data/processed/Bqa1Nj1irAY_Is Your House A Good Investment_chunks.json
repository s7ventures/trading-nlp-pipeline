  "is real estate and particularly your house a great investment for [Music] you so just in case you have that burning question what is the growth in housing prices in the top 10 cities in the US so they pulled this data from Zillow so the question is for a lot of people is your house your the house a person's house is typically their biggest dollar investment okay so they say well I'm buying this house is an investment okay that's fine and I understand it um you can do things in a house that you",
  "it um you can do things in a house that you can't do in an apartment you can paint it any color you want you can have pets you can you can you can have all sorts of stuff in your house that you couldn't have in an apartment and a house real estate can be a stable way to build wealth over time so generally speaking and this is my experience again data point of one year real estate in general goes up about 2% a year okay now that's very zip code specific so you can look at a zip code and you know",
  "so you can look at a zip code and you know in Silicon Valley and that might have gone up 30% a the year or you know a hot Market you know in Miami or you know Austin Texas or wherever um you can get very specific pockets of real estate that just jump dramatically higher and even fall as as dramatically um than 2% so 2% though is kind of what I consider a ballpark number and you know I have some real estate Investments and that's kind of what they do so and this is what they found in the the",
  "they do so and this is what they found in the the United States over the past year August 20123 August 2024 real estate went up about 3% now I don't know what that means okay is it houses is it land is it whatever but this is what they what they pulled up and what jumped out in particular was some things like New York La in Chicago and Chicago I'm very familiar with I live in Chicago for over 20 years own some property in Chicago I know the Chicago Market fairly well 6% is pretty high um and",
  "Market fairly well 6% is pretty high um and the reason why I would I would take some of this data with with a little bit of a little bit of uh skepticism is that I know Chicago Illinois has been losing population for years now people have been immigrating out of ill Illinois for other states that is also true for Chicago maybe not as dramatically as the rest of the state but people Chicago has been losing population I think uh the the the the way to think about it is there's just enough birth",
  "to think about it is there's just enough birth and and I think the birth rate is high enough to maintain it but people are leaving Chicago so who's coming in and driving up this this these prices up 6% in uh in the city I don't know it might because 20 to 20 20 22 to 23 was weak and this is bouncing back the same is true for New York I know New York was getting pum particularly the commercial uh real estate commercial real estate in Chicago too has been pummeled so are these numbers accurate",
  "has been pummeled so are these numbers accurate well they're accurate in as much as Zillow has reported them and Zillow knows the data it's looking at um you know and again it's zip code specific and Chicago is a city of neighborhoods you know this is a dozen different neighborhoods each with its own particular flavor of real estate so some can go up a lot more than others some are more active than others and so this may you know the Chicago number and the same is true with New York and La",
  "number and the same is true with New York and La there may be Pockets that went up a lot more than others and that may be why you're seeing this stuff anyway and you know is this meaningful is this something you should say well my house in Boston went up 7% therefore I made 7% return on my house I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say that like I said it is is zip code and neighborhood specific and house specific and if you're not hitting all those major points the 7% you may be up 1% you don't know",
  "points the 7% you may be up 1% you don't know you don't know until you actually try and sell your house that's why yes I understand the appeal of owning a house I get it I get it I get it and I have other real estate in you know it's I get it and they're generating rents and that's another Revenue stream for me but trading is way more liquid than real estate trading options is way more liquid than real estate estate you can also Define your risk better than real estate and we're going to talk",
  "better than real estate and we're going to talk about a couple defined risk trades here so yes saving up money for a down payment on a house great idea excellent go buy your house but soon after start saving up to fund a trading account get that couple of thousand in your trading account and start trading that is going to teach you more about money and the the market and managing money and finances then your house will okay so because Traders AG in dog years okay one expiration for an option",
  "AG in dog years okay one expiration for an option Trader is like you know two years in any other job so that that's my point So the faster you get to start trading the better let's take a look at a couple of trade ideas the guys are looking at so metals have been on a run recently with copper Futures up nearly 3% today this was a couple days ago what happened was China really had some uh big stimulus package they announced who knows whether it's real or not and the IDE China is one of the",
  "it's real or not and the IDE China is one of the biggest copper consumers in the world and FCX free Port mcor is one of the biggest copper producers the guys looked at selling a strangle in there let's take a look at FCX FCX as a earning are coming out October 17th and has a nice run up massive rally here um if you wanted to let's take a look at the skew so it's trading right around let's say 52 so here's what the way I look at this if I go down three points Market's closed right now so the",
  "three points Market's closed right now so the data is a little screwy let's look at the 36 day options see if they're a little better yeah they're a little bit better so Stock's trading at about 52 I go down um three points and the options about $130 or so up three points to the 55s it's about $140 so right now there is skew to the upside so the market anticipates um more Alles stronger um performance in FCX if you're willing to take risk through earnings you could consider uh selling a put in",
  "earnings you could consider uh selling a put in here again a $52 stock uh if I sold the 47 puts um you know only requires $551 of of of capital Max profit 70% Theta of 248 Max risk if the stock goes to Zer is $4,600 but there's a 90% probability making half its Max profit of $35 before for um before expiration so that's something if you were bullish on FCX I know the guys were leing to strangle but um I'm not sure if uh you want to sell a call going into this the second trade um that they were",
  "into this the second trade um that they were looking at is a is a Visa iron Condor uh $277 stock so it's more expensive Visa has been a news-driven trade recently with antitrust lawsuits raised by the justice department St between 260 and 290 for the better part of 2024 currently sits in the middle so let's take a look at that and what they're talking about Visa has decent decent liquidity it's sold off pretty sharply of these past couple of days but as the guys were saying it's it's right in",
  "but as the guys were saying it's it's right in the middle of where it's been they were looking at an iron Conor earnings are coming out on o 22 on October 22nd so you have to be willing to take risk through earnings if you're going to look at this trade they are looking at the October U the 20 the 250 260 put spread in the 29535 sell the 260s buy the 250s and so that's what they're doing right now the the put spread after the the market sold off it's a lot closer on the put side I would",
  "off it's a lot closer on the put side I would consider pulling this down just a bit let's go down to these strikes see what we get and then pull this down here 285 295 to adjust the strikes it's still the same idea just incorporating the sell off in the stock again um 54% IV rank means its options are relatively rich and the reason I might consider an iron condor in a stock like Verizon $271 is that naked options have really high margin requirements if I just went in and sold the 240 put in the",
  "if I just went in and sold the 240 put in the 2 285 call Marg requirement is $2,400 $4,000 yikes that that's that's pretty steep so if I go in and turn this into an iron Condor I'm getting about a third of the width of the strikes on this trade getting $3 credit for 10p Point uh iron Condor 10 points between the strikes that gives me about 30% of the strike wi that's a good Target uh buying power effect remember the short strangle at about4 what $4,000 Mar this has 688 still a little Rich okay",
  "$4,000 Mar this has 688 still a little Rich okay it's a little steep Max profits 312 um max loss is 688 74% probability of earning half that or about $150 before expiration generates about $3 80 of theta not a bad trade if you are willing to trade through earnings that's that's the decision here if you want to get these Cherry picks delivered to your inbox every week and my daily cherry bombs every day click on the link below"
