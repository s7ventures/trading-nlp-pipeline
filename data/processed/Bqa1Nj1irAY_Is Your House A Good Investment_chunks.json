  "may not be able to do in other investments so that's one of the reasons why people like real estate as an investment so let's take a look at the top 10 cities in the US for housing price growth according to Zillow.",
  "In a house, you have more freedom to customize and have pets compared to an apartment. Real estate can be a stable way to build wealth, with an average annual increase of about 2% in value.",
  "You can identify specific areas in Silicon Valley, Miami, or Austin, Texas where real estate prices have increased significantly, sometimes by 30% or more in a year. On the flip side, prices can also drop just as dramatically. A 2% increase is a common benchmark for real estate investments.",
  "In the United States, real estate prices increased by about 3% from August 2013 to August 2024. Cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago saw a 6% increase in real estate prices.",
  "Market fairly well 6% is pretty high. Chicago, Illinois has been losing population for years as people have been immigrating out of the state. Chicago has been losing population, but maybe not as dramatically as the rest of Illinois.",
  "The birth rate in Chicago is high enough to maintain population levels, but people are leaving the city. This may be driving up prices by 6%. It is possible that the increase is due to a bounce back from weak years in 2022 and 2023. New York is experiencing similar trends, especially in commercial real estate. The accuracy of these numbers may be affected by recent economic conditions.",
  "The numbers reported by Zillow are accurate and specific to each zip code in cities like Chicago, New York, and LA. Real estate trends can vary greatly between neighborhoods.",
  "The performance of real estate markets varies by location. It is important to consider specific factors such as zip code, neighborhood, and individual property when assessing returns. Simply looking at a percentage increase in one area may not accurately reflect overall gains.",
  "Trading options offers more liquidity and allows for better risk management compared to owning real estate. While owning property can generate rental income, trading provides the flexibility to quickly buy and sell assets. It's important to understand the benefits of both investment options.",
  "We will discuss a couple of defined risk trades that can be more beneficial than investing in real estate. Saving up for a down payment on a house is a good idea, but consider funding a trading account with a couple of thousand dollars to learn more about money, the market, and financial management. Trading can provide valuable insights that owning a house may not offer. Consider one expiration for an option trade.",
  "AG in dog years okay one expiration for an option Trader is like you know two years in any other job. So the faster you start trading, the better. Metals have been on a run recently with copper Futures up nearly 3% today. China announced a big stimulus package, causing the increase.",
  "IDE China is a major copper consumer and FCX is a top copper producer. Consider selling a strangle in FCX ahead of its earnings on October 17th. The stock has had a significant rally recently, trading around $52.",
  "Market is closed, so data may be inaccurate. Looking at 36-day options, stock is trading at $52. The $130 put is up 3 points, while the $140 call is up 3 points. There is upside skew, indicating market anticipates stronger performance in FCX. Consider selling a put if willing to take risk through earnings.",
  "consider selling a put on a $52 stock like FCX. Selling the 47 puts requires $551 capital with a max profit of 70% and a theta of 248. Max risk is $4,600 if the stock goes to zero, but there's a 90% probability of making half the max profit of $35 before expiration. If bullish on FCX, selling a put could be a good strategy.",
  "The second trade being considered is a Visa iron Condor on a $277 stock. Visa has been in the news due to antitrust lawsuits. It has been trading between $260 and $290 for most of 2024 and currently sits in the middle. Visa has decent liquidity and has sold off recently.",
  "The earnings for Conor are coming out on October 22nd. They are considering a put spread for the October 20th expiration, selling the 260 strike and buying the 250 strike. The market has sold off, making the put spread closer.",
  "Consider adjusting the put side closer to the current price. Look at strikes around 285-295. With a 54% IV rank, options are relatively expensive. An iron condor on Verizon ($271) may be a good choice due to high margin requirements for naked options.",
  "Selling the 240 put and the 285 call has a margin requirement of $2,400 to $4,000. Converting this into an iron condor yields a $3 credit for a 10-point spread between the strikes, which is about 30% of the strike width. The buying power effect for the short strangle is around $4,000, while the margin is at 688, which is still high.",
  "$4,000 Mar, 688 still a little steep. Max profits 312, max loss 688. 74% probability of earning $150 before expiration. Generates about $3.80 of theta. Consider trading through earnings. To receive Cherry picks and daily cherry bombs, click the link below."
