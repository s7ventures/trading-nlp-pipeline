  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptista I have a trade idea for you today January 26th 2024 the year is over almost over I hope you all had a Merry Christmas a happy Hanukkah or whatever that you uh celebrate over this long break but you know what the Market's not taking a break and let's see what's going on &ps down $4 basically um an unchanged day NASDAQ down 12 excuse me I'm fighting off a cold uh Russell up 13 and the Dow up 14 Dow and the Russell A Little Bit Stronger today",
  "Dow and the Russell A Little Bit Stronger today Russell being the strongest of the group and &ps and NASDAQ being the weakest of the group volatility up 30 cents after getting creamed the last 3 or 4 days as you can see here volatility going from the low 20s down into the mid teens 1622 and bonds continue to fall down nine ticks I looked into bonds a little bit I'm the world's worst commodity Trader so I decided to go with a a pseudo commodity trade I went with coin now when you look at the",
  "trade I went with coin now when you look at the numbers on coin here just from the the chart itself coin down $434 Ivy rank of 11 and change usually not a premium selling strategy for us but I'm going to do it with a little bit of Premium selling with a directional bias to it now I was looking into coin as maybe doing a diagonal trade in here something like selling the Feb uh options that are two or three strikes I'm sorry buying the Feb options that are one two or three strikes out of the",
  "that are one two or three strikes out of the money and selling the January options that are two three four strikes out of the money to give myself a little bit of long Delta in here but with earnings looming on January 29th and only 22 days to January options I figured I needed a a quicker move to the upside then I would think I wanted to stay in this strategy meaning that I didn't know if I had the timing right on this trade I am going to go with a somewhat seemingly Delta long uh strategy in",
  "a somewhat seemingly Delta long uh strategy in here but well outside the expected move let me explain a quick second you'll notice here that the ivy rank being 11 and change looks like there's a little bit of skewed data in here because there's no reason for coin to go from an ivy rank of 40 something a little bit more uh High High to mid-range uh for its Ivy Rank and to come down to 11 I think yesterday with the day off is screwing or the market being closed is skewing a lot of these Ivy ranks",
  "being closed is skewing a lot of these Ivy ranks to look artificially low so I'm going to take that off with a grain of salt I'm going to go here um on the tasty trade platform and look at the watch list here you'll see that coin is down $4.75 it's had a decent size range at the lower end of its range but it's been lower than this looks a little weak today and that's why I'm going to look for a little bit of a bullish type trade in coin we also had Bitcoin up around 100,000 100,000 And1 uh just",
  "Bitcoin up around 100,000 100,000 And1 uh just last night you can see here Bitcoin uh significantly higher last I'm going to play for a little of end of the rally in Bitcoin so that coin too uh might benefit from that now I'm looking at when you when you're doing this type of trade I'm going to do a 1x two put ratio spread here I'm going to be able to go $10 wide which is nice too um you're always taking a look at you know the volatility because you're selling an extra unit here the implied",
  "you're selling an extra unit here the implied volatility of 83 83 seems to be quite high when I compare it to some of the other uh months that we have here but don't forget you do have earnings coming January 29th that will um have a little bit of bearing on these options since they're February 21st but with a almost a month away I don't think you're going to see February volatility uptick that much to uh to to kind of scare you away from this trade so what am I looking to do here I said it was",
  "so what am I looking to do here I said it was a 1 by two ratio spread I usually like to go with my with my buy somewhere around the 15ish Delta I'm going to go even further out of the money by going to the 180 puts I'm going to buy the 180 puts we're looking at around uh right at the standard deviation here that's that dotted line I'm buying the 180s and I'm going to look to sell two of the 170s two of the 170s I was actually able to do this markets are quite wide here with with Bitcoin a",
  "markets are quite wide here with with Bitcoin a little bit higher uh than it is right now remember the lower it goes the better off you are I was able to do this for $176 credit here you can see the mid price is now A180 $1.75 so with the stock right around here I was able to do this for a $1.76 credit markets are a little wide here you'll notice that these options are 15 and these options are even wider than that so A good reference would be where I got filled remember this is a small Delta",
  "where I got filled remember this is a small Delta trade for Deltas you'll probably be able to get filled at a similar price if you go in when the stock is down around $5 $5 and change but please go in a little bit higher work walk your order down it doesn't cost you anything this trade is a 94% pop it does have a positive Theta decay of 7 and A2 it does have four long Deltas you'll notice when I've done these trades um previously I'd have 10 12 15 almost 20 Deltas I'm going much further out of",
  "15 almost 20 Deltas I'm going much further out of the money here a matter of fact my break even on this trade is $160 if you look at the chart here we haven't seen $160 well we got down or close to it back in September and if you throw out September we haven't been back there since about a year ago in February now does this make it a does this make it an unreasonable uh idea that that coin would never go back down to$ 160 about $90 lower than where it is right now even though the expected move",
  "it is right now even though the expected move is only $62 no anything can happen but for the $3,400 in buying power to collect $176 looking to make a buck on a directional bias I want the stock to go a little bit higher or volatility to contract and this extra unit um Decay a lot faster than my long unit with the chance to make $1,000 because you'll notice here my Max profit is $1,000 plus the credit I received so $1,176 it looks like the type of trade that I don't mind holding well into",
  "type of trade that I don't mind holding well into February expiration and into earnings which are January 29th in coin 94% pop positive Theta Decay I'm going to throw out this Ivy rank of being very low because I think the numbers are a little screwed up because of uh the day off this week uh and that's why I also moved it further away to give myself less Delta less directional risk tying up $3,400 my Max profit which I think is a little unreasonable cuz that probably will not hold us uh into",
  "cuz that probably will not hold us uh into expiration and we probably are not going to get a pin of 170 but maybe we can get a little bit of a lower down move and you'll be able to make some money on this trade even more than the $1.76 that you put here see as you see the stock going lower you can see the mid price moves around I don't think you'll be able to get filled at a $1.93 but maybe you get filled a little bit better if I get off this video and the stock is still down here I'll put on a",
  "and the stock is still down here I'll put on a couple more contracts and try to put on the follow page uh for you where you'll see this trade uh again I'll get off of the this podcast I'll put this trade in here for your coin and you'll be able to see it as you can see all of my trades in real time all right everybody this is where I ask you listen I'm sick and I'm doing this video for you so please help us by uh bringing your account to Tasty Li tasty trade transfer move bring your account uh",
