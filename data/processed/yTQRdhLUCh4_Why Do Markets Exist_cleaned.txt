so last week was a pretty sizable move lower but volatility didn't really move until Friday even based on where it closed Friday it doesn't seem that high does that make you think that maybe this sell-off will be shortlived yeah I mean I think we're going to have cyclical sideways action with a slight bullish bias to it going into the end of the year that's just my opinion Victor Jones thinks we're crashing and burning you know I mean opinions are like armpits you usually have two they usually both stink and trade what's in front of you but that's what I'm looking at do I think it'll be shortlived actually don't I know Tony does that's what makes a market exactly there are definitely different schools on this the biggest volatility risk in my opinion always comes from lower volatility levels not higher so I think there's more risk now that if volatility was higher
