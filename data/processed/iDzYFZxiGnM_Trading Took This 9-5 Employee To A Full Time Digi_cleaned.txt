so you started trading when you were 11 I did a lot of lawn cutting $10 to $15 a lawn or I could go out and sell a cover call and maybe make 80 or 100 that's impressive have about an 87% success rate over about 30 years you know we're not talking about a small amount of money I try to trade for base hits that's really how you build wealth he's been able to generate plus 25 or 30% return for most of the last 7 years [Music] all right welcome back everybody this is another rising star and today is going to be a fun one because I've known John for quite a while John welcome to Tasty and welcome to the rising star shoot thank you I I mean I met you once before we went out to to lunch a couple years ago in Atlanta when I a show down there at the varsity at the varsity right at the varsity yep what have what do you have what do you have yeah what do you have what do you say wasn't it like yeah crazy um anyway but the fun thing is you know we've stayed in touch over the years and um through lots of emails and I'm an email junkie you're you're a pretty good email junky yourself and um we have um you know followed each other's trades and and talked about trading for years now so I have a pretty good idea of who you are but we're going to introduce you to all that to a tasty nation and your story is a really fun story I have to start off this thing by saying um I wanted to title this um the crocodile hunter because you're the only person I I've ever met that's actually um hunted a crocodile I don't know I don't know if that's good or bad but I live in the city here and we don't have a lot of crocodiles in downtown Chicago we have other problems but we don't have crocodiles what something I've always wanted to do um it's kind of out there a risk um project and something I thought would be fun same with the pythons yeah you're a python Hunter too that to me seems just insane so I can't even like I can't rationalize hunting for pythons so I'm not even going to go there yeah cuz I can't figure that out at all in um the non-financial stuff I like a little more risk so the hunting of the and pythons when it comes to you'll see when we talk with the um quite risk adverse when it comes to investing bill I find that to be very strange that you're willing to go out and hunt a python with your bare hands or a crocodile with your bare hands but you're uncomfortable selling a naked call or puss oh no I'll do that but there you know have to mitigate the risk okay talk about okay anyway I I find that kind of fun anyway but the other side to this is that the angle that I want to take with you and and I hope you're okay with this is you you're 55 you're 12 years younger than me and we've been trading about the same amount of time 44 years for both of us you started when you were 11 which I find pretty incredible I didn't start till I was in about you know um early 20s I didn't even know about trading before that um but we've both been doing this a long time and I think that the the real story here is longevity and I've always been one that goes around talking at different seminars and entrepreneurial events and and different business stuff and and I like to preach that there is a very tiny um difference between success and failure and the most important aspect of success is longevity mhm I agree 100% and you're my proof you're my walking talking you know proof of this yeah so you'll see if you go on YouTube and you'll see a lot of trade for 30 minutes a day and drive this Lamborghini yes that doesn't that's not me it's not how things work well it's not anybody that's not the real world I mean there's there's six outwire cases you know like you know guy you know Mark Zuckerberg starts company when 22 turns into to be worth you know a trillion dollars there's not a lot of cases like that I try to trade for base hits or doubles I'll take the home run if it comes but I don't trade for it um I'm I'm a trade small trade often like Trader 100% um yeah I've been trading for like when I was 11 Mike grandfathers was an options Trader he traded a lot of options way back before there was online anything yeah I'm sure so I remember being at his house we' go through the newspaper and I I probably haven't touched the newspaper like in 30 years I you but we' go through the newspaper look at the stocks look at Option prices um we used to have these big books like I think it was SNP or someone that would Lea through these value line value line that got be and they would be like three months old but you could see charts and and a little bit of um ratios in there so uh of course at 11 I wasn't trading strangles no of course it was um mainly buying calls and selling cover calls oh okay so I did a lot of at that age say like early teens I did a lot of lawn cutting so $10 $15 a lawn or I could go out and sell a covered call and maybe make 80 or 100 and it was a lot less work um now I I did both so I would do the cover calls and cut grass because there's a there's something fun about cutting grass uh then I always had a penchant for investing so I became a series 7 broker at 18 at 18 you can become Series 7 you can't who would register an 18-year-old oh that's crazy and so before you went to college you got a series 7 or at the same time at the same time yeah about the same time that's that's kind of crazy so you undergraduate degree and graduate degree both in finance accounting that's right um taxes yeah I got so so your your professional career was in let's call it Financial Accounting I mean Financial Accounting um a lot of business Consulting business process improved all that type of stuff and that brought me uh up and down the east coast and then um for the last couple decades overseas and we've been okay so so you grew up in Florida and you end up all around the world doing financial consulting tax Consulting and everything else but you're trading primarily that whole time in US markets y or or no always us always us markets but you taught yourself lots of different languages um a few a few I'm not good at any of them I barely know English you were learning about business all over the world so so you have a um a probably a different perspective on on what US market structure is and you know how businesses run in a kind of in a free market as opposed to businesses running in maybe let's call them non-free markets non-free markets right and then probably give you a pretty good appreciation for what we have here it it really does cuz from the US of course it's the SEC and those it's kind of a double-edged sword you don't want all the um regulations but you also want them it it gives you the disclosures it protects the individual you want the Integrity you you want Marketplace Integrity you would prefer to have less regulatory limitations and fences yeah and there's a line depending on what side of the fence you're on yeah and we've been we've been challenged with this and AR you know and debating this forever we're still we had the debate this morning actually on air same type of thing um you know as we get towards tokenization and things like that so throughout your entire professional career you're trading but you're not necessarily trading you know complex option strategies you're just you're trading you're just trading stocks you're trading Futures you're tra you trade everything right yep product different but at some point you you how'd you find tasty about 5 years ago 6 years ago I was looking for ways to improve my trading I did really well um have about an 87% success rate over about 30 years but just understand that 87% success rate does not mean 87% return I I going yes like I have a very high success rate but a lot of times it doesn't mean cuz I'm a high I like to do high probability trades where you're going to be successful most of the time right but it doesn't mean it doesn't it doesn't translate to it necessarily to a return just c yeah 100% I as a goal I try to have around 3% so 40 to 50% a year but that's you know an object it's a goal um and the 87% it might be a little bit too risk adverse you know maybe but it works but like when I do Futures it's like 50 5% so I'm not very not as good as with commodities as I am with with stock options yeah but I've traded as you know I've traded in a bunch of oceans in the middle of the ocean oh yeah I've traded on all the continents except for um Antarctica but I'll be there later this year and I plan to put a token trade on there hopefully I get some so some people like to do marathons in all seven continents and I don't see you as a marathon runner so I'm going to guess that you want to be trading in all seven cost of yes yeah that's kind of cool though I probably have traded in a 100 different countries as well that's impressive that you even been to 100 different countries do you have anybody in your world that does what you do do you have anybody to talk to I have uh a couple people that I know that a couple people yeah y but it's a small Universe it's a very small universe and it's always been like that okay uh because if you go to a party or something oh what do you do oh I trade stock options and then you get the fuzzy glassy look yeah and so um what about your wife she think you're crazy yeah you know how it is being married to a traitor so for your wife well I don't know how it is being married to a traitor I know what she says about me but that's up yeah it's um you know you one of the toughest things is to not be emotional you and you're making a trade or a trade goes everybody can put a trade on it's how do you make manage it when it goes you don't seem to be you seem to be emotionally pretty uh pretty even yes but if something really goes against you and you've taken a position that's too big what about when things get like how did you do on you know uh August 5th this year or you know the week week ago Monday whatever it was we opened down was that this Monday can't remember might be this Monday we open down you know 40 points in the SVS right right well there's a little bit of that anxiety well on the on the Futures on Sunday night where you go oh boy Monday might be really difficult and um so you're junkie do you have to watch the market try not to I try to keep business hours let's say for the markets um and not have it spill into the rest of life um it doesn't always work but I that's what I'm attempting business hours are by the way from Sunday night at 4 5:00 till Friday at 5:00 those are bil this hours I mean I make no mistake you know it's it's there's a few trading hours that you really are trading but mentally it's 20 hours a day right it's just how it is um and it's I think anybody can trade anybody can learn how to trade if I could do it I think any I'm not real smart I mean sure I'm just an average guy um people can TR it um but can you do it over the long term and you don't blow up your account um that's the the whole longevity thing that's the 44 years of this um how many hours a day are you in front of your screen six six hours a day in front of your screen yeah5 yeah okay that that's legit like that's like that's like Tom hours like those are like I enjoy it what else would I do those are dog hours those those are like you know that's junky stuff yeah um what concerns me is okay I've been doing this for 40 years um well how many more years do I have can I do it for another 20 probably not another 40 so it's a it's a strange and I don't know if you thought about that yourself but what do you do and I don't think about it because I don't want to know like I don't want to I mean um I am I'm I'm always reminded of the story of when years ago when we first built think or so there there was a there was a one of the original guys that started the CME uh one of the first I think five members of the CMA um he's about mid90s and he was the uncle of a buddy of mine and he was still trading in his mid90s and we had a walk up our our ability was a walk up and he came to the office and he he's couldn't make it up the stairs so one of the guys on the trade desk carried him upstairs cuz we didn't have an elevator at the time and you still trading in ' 95 and he was my inspiration because I'm like you know and he's sitting there sitting on our trade desk you know with his with his own account open going yeah you know sell this you know he was still trading basically every future on the CMB and I'm watching this guy and I'm like okay that's what I'm doing like he can do this at 95 you's got an oxygen tank there I'm like I could do this like I don't I see myself in the exact same you know doing the exact same thing he was he was and he was you know yelling at the screen and I'm like that will keep me alive buunny well I'm teaching my mom how to trade so she's 80 she does uncovered puts and sells CER calls there you go by the way I'm a genius she says she is she well she has no choice at this point you know she's not have any more kids she's happy yeah she was making money she's making money full markets make make Geniuses out of their son of and so but you were always a genius now you're more of a genius yeah everybody makes money in bu Market yeah does it lead to anything else that you do like I mean I'm just saying you know are there other uh Hobbies occupation anything else does it help with you know the Consulting work and other things that you do well but one thing that it does help a lot with is uh trading in general makes allows you to look at data information quickly and make a quick decision and then you stand behind your decisions um you know CPAs by definition are not really Risk Takers right they they're much it's it's it's the analytical part yes the risk-taking part is sometimes you right exactly yeah yeah atypical and that the probabilistic side I think is easy to understand I think the speculative side is a little more challenging what is and you might find this too after I'm Trading have all my screens and everything's flashing and boom you're done for the day then you go out in the real world you have to turn off that um emotionless trading everything fits in a curve and now you're in this environment where it's like emotional and you got to not be analytical you got to be more you have to try to be normal you call it being normal right normal you have to talk to real people and try to be normal I remember trading uh the day of the crash in 1987 and it was one of the wildest days of my life so I remember like it was yesterday and and I left the training floor a little after 3:00 central time when we shut down and I went upstairs the office and it was like it was almost like a ghost town everybody had left and it was just kind of scary and then I drove home and stopped at a hot dog stand and everybody was normal and I was like what the f is going on on here like does anybody know the stock mar crash said and nobody cared well I Ed honestly funny you say that cuz I use that as a litus test is we see it and we feel it and and if the if you go out in the normal world and nobody's thinking of it or no one even mentions it any day even like Monday where it was real crazy like no I guess it's not that big of a deal um now if he gets to two days three days four days like that then people and the news media pick it up and everybody talks about it then it might be a bigger deal so I use that as my little bit of a reality check of don't don't get too worried about or too excited about things do you ever think because of all the traveling you've done in your life and you know trading from a 100 different countries and all that kind of stuff do you ever think that like you have a different perspective like you think about things differently like currencies and precious metals and things like that or does it all just kind of has it all just become a numb game now um culturally I I hope I understand and appreciate different cultures foods and people insuring ideas but when it comes to financial instruments I think it's pretty pretty just it's right there it's pretty much numbers yeah yeah it's just numbers I got it what's the worst trade that's gone against you recently probably Tesla Tesla yeah and you were shorted yes I was short I was short on Tesla yeah but it's also my best trades is Tesla I I treat I mean I'm I'm all over the board Tesla's my biggest trade trading vehicle because it's well there's a lot of juice on there right now yes and Tesla is um either the most liquid or the second most liquid underlying to trade Nvidia is number one Tesla's number two so the reality is that sure makes sense so like for instance with Tesla right now I have strangles I have a I um call butterfly I have naked puts and not it's not Capital efficient I know but I will buy the stock and sell at the money cover calls just for the week there's so much premium in that and then the stock generally get taken from me to and it gives me about a 3% return a week I mean if that works it's amazing it's not you know I know it's not efficient yeah I know but it's like if there's a little extra money I'll do that okay yeah that's I mean for people that are are inherently bullish in Tesla that's a reasonable way to play it so what happens when a position doesn't work so you do a covered call in Tesla now the stock goes lower now what do you do for inst Tesla went lower this week yeah I had cover calls I rolled the cover calls down yeah you know get more Jews higher Delta um I'll keep that premium this week more than likely now have the stock yeah cuz it won't won't be taken from me at my breke probably not Tes but it jumps all over but if it doesn't I'll just keep the stock and Monday morning I'll put on new covered calls just roll new covered calls yeah yeah okay is there any part of the trading world that kind of where you at this point you you feel like I still don't get this I really understand this doesn't make any sense to me or does it kind of Mak sense I mean you own everything you do now from a accountability standpoint oh I own everything I I do um make very quick decisions and you have to live with the decisions you make oh for sure yeah 100% it's all on me so what do you do when something goes against you look at the delta look at the profit loss roll down roll out yeah and do size how often do you you reduce size well this might be a little bit of an odity um for me try me uh my I don't trade um definitely from a definitional standpoint of large enough my net lick is here and I'm trading here and so what percent of your net L to use most of the time um it's too low it's too low so you're saying you're like under 35% yeah okay so that's okay a year two years ago I doubled my contract size my my NOA trch and then this year I went up another 50% because I need to trade bigger kind and I know most people are that's a high class Problem by the way most have the other way they're trading way too big and um I mean in the whole world most people have a get-rich quick mentality which forces them to trade to do everything too big and it usually doesn't work out you're way better off doing everything too small proving concept and then scaling out like we do it we even with the DTE I'm very happy taking 50 $50 per um spread sure or you know 25% whatever I I'm pickled yeah no no I completely understand that to lot me too and I'll do that all day long just the same way I don't I don't feel any you know I don't care what the number is just as long as it's a positive number I care it's $50 or $500 whatever it is it's just positive number so let's let's get into okay how does somebody trade for 40 plus years and just to put context around John's account stuff I'm just going to say that it's plus six figures to make it clear to everybody that you know we're not talking about a small amount of money and um also that you know targeted return for him he's been able to generate in the you know let's call it plus 25 or 30% return for most of the last seven years and that's impressive because that's really how you build wealth and I'm going to be a little vague on that because I really want to get into the nitty-gritty of kind of what do you do so like and and and I should say that based on our our pre our chat before we did this you make about between 10 and 30 trades a day mhm okay yeah you hit on a real slow day 50 if there's really problems that I have to address yeah that that makes sense or or the Market's really busy or there's lots of opportunity and again how much of that is in the Futures world and how much that is sh in the equity World probably 80% Equity 80% Equity well that's not that's very typical for a tasty Traer just so you know like we're 8020 about or 7722 something like that I mean I do a lot of um on the future side I do a lot of bonds currency some corn and wheat uh I'm not very good at those but I do put those on by the way nobody's very good at those yeah and uh on that market I they're such big products uh on the future side I I trade generally um spreads sure whether it's a future or it's an equity the strategies to you the mechanics I mean do you use different mechanics or the same mechanics really the same yeah that was something that um 15 years ago or so I started getting into the um Futures market and the as you know different they trade at different times different ticks all this weird Nuance no and that's why I liked your small exchange I hope that comes back um it's we're we're working on it right now um but then watching you all I decided I don't really even need to know all that detail um I'm just going to trade it product and different and trade with the same methodologies that I do on the option side or the uh Equity side what about shorter term options the zero days and things like that the 1 DT zero DT how much of your trading is zero and 1 DT well it's growing um you know right now we have a pretty good um vix right 18 or oh so yeah little less right to in 18 yeah so if that market dries up the trading has to change you know the style has to change and that's always the trick is for me anyway to know lot of volatility sell premium less volatility when does it start moving um when does it switch into more debit spreads and things like that is there a specific go-to strategy or is there something like you you know like I know you trade a lot of earnings I know you trade some zero DTS um but is there a specific kind of go-to strategy um well on the zero day and it's I'm trading those more often and I'm you have great studies on those yeah and so I've been trading them as the market goes up I'm also now trading them as the market trends down and also if it's um flat and what I do with I take all the methodologies that you have best times of the day and and those things it's based on volatility um but I also overlay a 513 EMA 513 EMA so what does that mean exp menal moving average um and that is kind of the 513 um 5 day 13 day oh okay got it and so that that is like theity with with that you don't do any of the charting and I um being a CPA I don't look at any of the numbers anymore okay um the the numbers are somewhat meaningless earnings and things like that to me um it's all about what the perception of the market the Market's perception of what's the strategy are you primar I mean you're primarily a premium seller yes yeah yeah okay and are you is it are you always covered or is there a naked side to it oh I probably do 70% naked 70% naked but sometimes when you trade the zero days you have to cover it just for Capital reason that's right yeah there's some um unique let's say SEC rules around that yeah that you know yeah that'd be the $120,000 on one lot yes exactly exactly yeah um so on the I do a lot in the SPX so you might have a study where it says oh it's the best time to buy at 10:00 and you do a little debit spread at the money uh I'll do that but I'll overlay when the 513 crosses then if it's Crossing at that same time I know that's going to uh well I hope it's going to give a little juice you never know you never know but I'm trying to um even if it's a one or 2% more chance of it I try to what's your kind of core Equity strategy like if you had like this afternoon you know Apple has earnings coming out like what's your Apple kind of goto strategy well what I if you were to trade it what I do every single day um 100 200 300 times a day is look at the stocks ivr that's the very first thing I look at then look at the volume for the stock okay I look at the volume for the strikes okay um then I look at the bid ask I'm looking for tighter bit ask I look at Delta pop gamma yeah um Theta not too much because that's kind of already built no problem so I I look at those things and then um look at then I kind of look at the charts a little bit to see you I bullish bearish a lot of times I'm just delta neutral okay and that's fine so like with apple there's not much to juice in it today but I probably would go delta neutral 15 if there was enough premium in it I go two times the expected move one and a half times expected move is like $9 the not much interest in that yeah it could blow through that real fast right so two times you expect the move is $18 the premium out $18 was about 75 total not really it's not that interesting do you play it uh I rank is in let's say 70s or 80s do you play it um probably not okay probably not uh I'd like to I like to get a little more okay uh meta I had a$ five doll um spread on and those were like nine eight or nine Delta on each side real far out and um and a lot of juice yeah um yeah that was a different story you can trade IBM and get upside down right two times expect a move on that today that's right when you start out the day and you just look at your you look at the screen you log on you look at the screen to say okay like is your thought process and and I and I and I want you to get really specific here detail-wise is the first thing you do adjust existing positions or is the first thing you do go in and create new positions always look at the existing okay when you look at your existing positions are you looking at your Delta or are you looking at your p&l a little bit of both okay cuz I'm a pnl person yeah cuz I look at my p&l first to see what's messed up and then I look at the Delta on those pnls to see how I have to neutralized go together of course I do and I don't roll as much as you do um but I will roll I roll up and down and uh probably 70% like I said are um strangles um if the ivr is low I might do a calendar a debit calendar you know so really ivr really drives and that's something that I didn't have before tasty ivr just didn't have you been able to keep your size and check like what happens if you put a position on it starts to go against you is your is your first objetive to um to adjust the position or reduce size or add to it what do you do yes what do you mean yes all all the above um I try not to not to increase my size the first thing is yeah you know it's always in my mind the reversion to the meme so if we get a big pop up or or a big pop down like we did on with Nvidia or some okay I feel like yeah that's a little overdone so I might lay into it a little bit more and sell more puts um or sometimes I'll just say well I'm just going to hold my position and it it'll float I think the longevity with the returns it's really remarkable so thanks for sharing your story thank you thanks for having me in if you think your trading Journey should be shared with tasty Nation we'd love to
