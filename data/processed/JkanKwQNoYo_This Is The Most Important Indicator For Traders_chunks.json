  "volatility, while in the 2020 to 2024 period, implied volatility has remained around 15%. Today, we will discuss managing the Delta of short strangles in various IV environments during these two time frames.",
  "In the 2016-2018 period, the VIX averaged around 14 with low implied volatility. From 2020 to 2024, the VIX dropped from 40% to 25% and IV remained high, averaging 15% in 2024. We will compare selling the 25 Delta, 16 Delta, 25 Delta, and 35 Delta strangles 45 days to expiration, managing at 21 days, to observe the results in each time period.",
  "volatility periods, the win rate tends to be higher. Conversely, in high volatility periods, the win rate tends to be lower. This pattern is consistent across different time periods. It is important to consider volatility levels when making trading decisions.",
  "implied volatility is important in trading. Low implied volatility requires caution. The win rate is consistently high at 75%, 73%, and 72%. The average premium may seem acceptable, but when considering the average profit and loss, it may not be worth the risk. The worst loss can be significantly larger than the average gain. It is essential to assess the return on each trade.",
  "earn from widening your Delta strikes is not enough to offset the increased risk. It's important to find a balance between risk and return when trading in low implied volatility environments.",
  "lower at 65% but the return on Capital is higher at 182 and 8 so you can see that even though the win rate is lower the return on Capital is higher which is a good thing so you can see that in different time periods the win rate and return on Capital can vary but it's important to focus on the return on Capital when evaluating trading strategies.",
  "comparing the win rate, premium collected, worst losses, buying power per trade, and return on capital between low and high implied volatility trading periods. The difference in implied volatility levels can significantly impact trading outcomes, with higher volatility potentially leading to greater wealth creation.",
  "see a significant increase in your return on capital. This is a key factor to consider when trading in different market conditions.",
  "In periods of high implied volatility, trading strangles can be profitable. Scaling Delta strikes to 25 and 35 has increased premium collection compared to using 16 Delta strikes, resulting in better performance.",
  "Higher implied volatility conditions can increase profitability for strangles with higher Delta values by allowing for more expensive option premiums and faster time to increased premium.",
  "Higher Delta values are correct across the board. Adjusting Deltas of short premium positions in response to changes in implied volatility can stabilize a portfolio's risk exposure. Alterations in implied volatility impact the risk and return of all deltas, boosting the Delta.",
  "The return on deltas and boosting the Delta of a strangle can be profitable in high implied volatility environments. However, trading higher Delta strangles in low IV environments may lead to less favorable outcomes. Trading the 25 and 35 Delta strangles in low implied volatility may not yield good returns compared to trading in high implied volatility.",
  "Knowing something short, sweet, compact, and to the point is a valuable takeaway in trading."
