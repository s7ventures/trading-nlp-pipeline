  "We are continuing our four-part series on earnings every Monday. Today's focus is on spreading off earnings, particularly for IRA accounts or limited capital, by using an iron Condor strategy. This approach may result in slightly lower returns compared to a strangle strategy, which carries more risk but also higher potential rewards. By spreading off trades, we can manage risk and increase the probability of success.",
  "During earnings announcements, traders employ strategies like undefined risk strangles and defined risk iron condors to leverage increased volatility. Each strategy presents a different risk-reward profile. Let's take a closer look.",
  "The efficient market hypothesis states that asset prices reflect all available information, including earnings data. How do earnings and market sentiment influence a portfolio's risk-reward dynamics across different trading strategies? Traders can optimize their strategies in an efficient market by analyzing companies like Apple, Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla.",
  "Delta strangle and a 16 Delta iron Condor mean selling the same option with a slight adjustment in the iron Condor. Calculated average P&L, premium, buying power, and return on capital. Compared results from deploying the strangle alone. This analysis was conducted on four different stocks over six years.",
  "After years of analyzing four different stocks, the 16 Delta strangle strategy has shown a 70-78% chance of success. The ratio of average profit over buying power is 0.2028, with premium collected and return on investment being key factors. Over a six-year period, Tesla was a loser while the other stocks were small winners.",
  "Earnings trades have a small edge, so keep that in mind. Let's focus on using an undefined risk strangle strategy for earnings. Last week, we saw high win rates, high ratios, decent premium collection, and good returns.",
  "The premium collector had a decent return on investment with Apple, but not with Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla, resulting in net negative numbers. Results for strangle trades on earnings were mixed, even with a 72-73% probability of profit. The potential return on investment for a strangle trade is high, but timing is crucial due to the risk of large moves.",
  "The risk of large moves during non-earnings periods was lower than during earnings periods. Let's move on to an iron Condor strategy to reduce risk.",
  "In the six-year bull market, strong NASDAQ stocks like Apple, Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla had fine win rates but negative return on investment due to losses outweighing gains. Despite high win rates, losses wiped out profits.",
  "a high win rate was offset by losses. The results are presented based solely on earnings data, which differs from the combined data. The return on investments was negative for Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla, but positive for Apple. The win rate decreased significantly. The ratio of average profit and loss over buying power turned positive, a reversal from previously being negative.",
  "The trading results were mixed, with Apple showing positive returns but Tesla and Amazon showing negative returns. The premium collected was positive overall, but the return on investment was only good for Apple. This highlights the risks of earnings trades.",
  "I have had success with post-earnings trades, but trading earnings themselves can be challenging due to high volatility and low liquidity. I have been selective with earnings trades, particularly with companies like Netflix, Amazon, Tesla, and Apple, which have had negative returns for earnings over the past 8 years. Trading bonds at four is not my preference.",
  "Netflix sold off post earnings today, along with Taiwan Semiconductor. Earnings have not been great this cycle. Summarizing the iron Condor strategy, the return on investment is potentially high.",
  "The potential return on investment for trading can range from -9% to +9% with optional timing. There is a risk of large price moves. During non-earning periods, the market is steadier but with lower returns. A strangle may outperform an iron Condor around earnings due to implied volatility crush and wider profit range, but it also carries more risk.",
  "Strangle carries more risk if the stock moves significantly, while Iron Condor has defined risk. It's a balance between higher potential profit and greater protection. Tech stocks, specifically Netflix, Google, and Apple, have been challenging in the last eight years.",
  "As Apple matures, trading becomes easier. Netflix and Amazon are challenging. Focus on stocks with stable movements to avoid large shifts. High implied volatility indicates potential volatility, so review historical earnings reactions. Keep position sizes small to manage potential price movements.",
  "Prizes can move the market unpredictably during earnings. Be cautious when trading around earnings. Some investors buy Premium before earnings and sell it shortly after. This strategy can be effective as volatility expands during earnings season.",
  "It's a strategy that works sometimes but not always. Earnings can be unpredictable. It's almost like a directional play. We try to avoid stocks with small moves, like Pharmaceuticals, and look for ones with tight liquid markets.",
  "In tight liquid markets, trading with defined risk is key. While wider markets pose risks, there are ways to mitigate them. Earnings events are temporary and business resumes as usual the next day."
