  "Welcome to Option Trades Today. I'm Tony the Baptist. Let's dive into a trade idea for December 17th, 2024. The Emin S&P is down $25. Volatility is slightly increasing by about 18 cents. Let's see what tomorrow brings.",
  "Volatility is increasing ahead of tomorrow's Fed announcement on interest rates, with bonds seeing the most activity. TLT will go ex-dividend tomorrow, so consider adjusting your options today, especially if they are deep in the money. Monthly implied volatility in TLT is low.",
  "If the dividends are around 40 and you have options near the 87 strike or below, they may be at risk of dividend risk. Search our archives for more information on dividend risk.",
  "If the dividend is 40 cents, look for a put option below 40 cents. The 87 strike put option is likely to have dividend risk. Check the open interest to confirm.",
  "Open interest is around 3,000 on the 87s and 177,000 on the 85s. Tomorrow, open interest should be close to zero if those options were exercised. Options with three days to go, from the '90s and below, may have exercise risk with open interest close to zero.",
  "Options will have an open interest close to zero. You can test my knowledge on the TLT dividend. Let's get back to the market analysis. I look for high option volume and sort by IV rank from highest to lowest.",
  "prefer not to trade stocks with upcoming earnings. NVIDIA has an IV rank of 29, which is lower than expected but has been increasing. The stock recently dropped 10% due to volatility contraction and expansion. I am considering a trade in NVIDIA.",
  "Trade in Nvidia. Nvidia stock is currently at $129, down $3 or 2.5% from its highs for the day. IVX 5-day change is up 7.5% with an IV rank of 30.",
  "Stock is up 7.5% with IV rank at 30, indicating expanding volatility. Considering a broken wing butterfly trade in Nvidia.",
  "Today, I am considering a put ratio spread on Nvidia, a stock with high implied volatilities that has been a market leader. Buying the dip has been successful for me in the past. I will adjust my trade to have a slightly higher Delta to reflect my bullish outlook on the stock.",
  "delta neutral position with a 1X2 ratio spread. I will buy one 121 strike option and sell two 118 strike options. This trade will help me achieve a balanced position.",
  "A tight ratio spread with higher Delta for a higher credit. Delta around 17 per contract. Received a credit of $186 for the trade.",
  "This trade was executed at 10:07 this morning. The stock was at 128.70 and is now at 129. My profit probability was 80% and I received a credit of 1.86. You can view these details in real time on the Tasty Trade platform. I prefer to go wider with my trades.",
  "I prefer to go wider to maximize profit potential. I aim for a Pop over 65% and my Theta is $7.76. With a Delta of 17, I am slightly bullish on the stock.",
  "involve buying the 121 put and selling the 118 put. This trade is bullish or neutral on the stock, which is currently down 10%. The break-even point is around 114.5.",
  "The spread would be worth $3 plus the almost $2 credit received, making the break-even point just under $5 below. The max profit on this trade is $486 with a credit of A1 86. If the stock sells off, there is potential for profit.",
  "The stock may sell off more today. If you have a credit of $186 in this trade and hold until expiration (31 days away), the spread could potentially make you $486. The goal is to make a profit on this trade.",
  "I am looking to profit from a potential rally in Nvidia tomorrow. The 17 Deltas could result in a profit of 50-60 cents if the stock goes up, or a loss of 20-30 dollars if it goes down. The probability of profit is still high at 80% or more. For those trading in an IRA account, the buying power reduction will be around 11-12,000 dollars for this trade.",
  "If you want to put $11 or $12,000 on this trade but don't have that amount in your IRA account, you can borrow some money by buying out-of-the-money puts. The specific put you buy will depend on how much credit you want to receive and how much you want to reduce your buying power.",
  "With a buying power of $20 over the next 31 days, purchasing the 88 puts costs about 50 cents a day. This amounts to a daily change of $70 on the trade. This means you could potentially take $6,000 to $8,000 and invest it elsewhere.",
  "Consider reallocating profits from one trade to another with a higher potential return. You can invest in interest-bearing stocks like BIL or ESGV, or keep cash on hand for future opportunities. Utilize out-of-the-money puts to leverage your IRA account like a margin account.",
  "One option is to use $20 to gain $7,000 to $8,000 in buying power. A typical trade could involve a $5 wide spread with an 85% probability of profit and a Delta under 10, resulting in a credit of $70. This approach allows for more efficient use of buying power compared to a trade with a $70 credit.",
  "I made a trade with $70 on the 121 put 118 put one by two for $186. The stock is rallying and has moved about $20. Consider transferring your account to Tasty Trade before the end of the year.",
