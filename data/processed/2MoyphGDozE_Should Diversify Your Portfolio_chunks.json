  "Concentration builds wealth, but diversification protects it. However, having a concentration of 7 or 12 stocks that control the market can hurt returns. It may hinder your ability to make money and build wealth.",
  "In a flat or down market, non-correlated positions can be beneficial. They can help protect your investments when things go south. Diversifying with non-correlated assets is key, especially when the market is highly concentrated in a few sectors."
