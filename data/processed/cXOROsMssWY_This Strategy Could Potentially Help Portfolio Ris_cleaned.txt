I know all right let's do it these are um this is a market measure that uh our research team put together for today really just talking about shorten the vix and profiting from implied volatility after this is over we'll tell you about some of the upcoming events that we have on the calendar but shorting the vix ready for this shorting the vix I'm ready for this volatility is one of the more prominent examples of a me of a mean reverting nature that we have the ability to trade that's fair I would say that volatility pairs trades there's some divergences in different indices and things like that but I would say volatility and volatility itself and pairs Treads are probably the two that we have the most kind of evidence of mean reversion on let's go to next slide knowing this it should be easy money easy money Mr Batista I love that one buy an inventory volatility below the mean and only sell it when it spikes if it is mean reverting why can't you just buy it every time it dips okay give it to me then you're just going to hold it and when it goes up you're going to sell it sell it when it goes back down again you're going to buy it looks easy from the chart here scoop of chocolate scoop of vanilla let's go to the next slide however there's always an however oh we run into a couple of problems we can't buy the vix and the vix Futures have a natural Decay and if there is no runup in volatility by expiration they just lose money right when they say you can't buy vix they're talking about vix uh stock right I mean you could do vix options if you wanted to but that already prices in uh all the vix that's right so the long Vick strategies using options can often run into the same problem if the timing is off which is usually due to volatility clustering near low levels what that means is when volatility goes when volatility goes down it kind of sits around forever then it costs a lot of money to carry a vix position otherwise everybody would Geniuses Whoever thought of these product structure because you know we clearly didn't when they were first when they first came out with this stuff let's go next slide relative to our high probability profitable strategies such as shorts strangles the vix is a very tough trade so we looked at this 2014 to present managed the 21 DTE we looked at long call spreads um and these are long implied volatility strategies so we looked at long call spreads and we looked at Short puts and the long call spreads for 10 years the win rate's 50% right down the middle the short putut the win ratees obviously going to be a little higher 78% the average pnl 20 and 80 bucks the max loss is significantly greater than than amount that you make and the buying power used a lot um let's see if we can the average p on the short put looks okay the average p on the short on the long call spread H maybe it's okay let's take a look relative amount of buying power it's using so can we do the exact opposite of this long volatility strategy has selling call spreads on volatility spikes been profitable take a look cuz all this kind of stuff is neat so we're going to sell a spike in volatility by selling a call spread let's look at the next slide well the short Vic strategies have been much more consistent in their success and produced positive p&l on average so a short at the money call spread on a spike um 78% with a 94% p&l and a short 30 Delta call spread 86% that's selling the 30 Delta call 86% with 54 with $58 so what's interesting here is that um selling vix essentially selling vix Deltas which is shorting the vix which is the title of this has worked much better than buying the vix and most people buy the vix as a hedge right but shorting the vix is worth works much better let's go to the next slide kind of the opposite of our thinking too a little bit here I mean I wouldn't I mean I'm short volatility in the strategies that I play but I never go to the vix and look to short vix yeah I don't sell I don't sell a lot of um I never have that position on synthetically right yeah we don't sell a lot of vix Deltas normally we probably should do more based on this study I think we should do more we just don't do it enough and and we probably do it in other things and we probably should use the vix more implied volatility is one of the more prominent examples of mean reverting of a mean reverting Market that we trade but it's tough to buy given the complex term structure it is incredibly difficult and Incredibly expensive to buy vix so maybe it makes more sense to short it that was the whole point of this thing and short it into defined risk risk way so short Vic strategies to perform in consistently profitable manner but we don't sell Naked calls to this market so we've done only toine risk trades it's actually been profitable and we don't do enough of that so we did this to kind of tell ourselves to hey we just need to consider um expanding our strategies into to short vix call spreads on rallies because we have not done enough of those um you disappointed with your performance yeah yeah I'm kind of disappointed my performance in the vix I I mean to be fair I don't think we've made a lot of money in the vix over the last couple of years years I think it's been very small and we can probably we probably should have done better yeah we used to do a lot of uh by Vick's Futures sell VI calls but that's very Capital intensive too you don't really Capital intensive really hard to manage I'd rather sell call spreads the problem with call spreads the mies are so damn cheap you have to do the at the money yeah
