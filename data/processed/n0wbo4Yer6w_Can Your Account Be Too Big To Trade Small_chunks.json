  "I can see how trading small and often works for a small portfolio but as I continue to increase the size of my portfolio the ability to trade small and often becomes increasingly difficult because the total number of Trades I need to get to an appropriate amount of capital use gets to be a little crazy how can this issue be managed better while minimizing variance I trade small and I trade often and I trade a large account you learn how to manage your Capital what that means is you learn that",
  "your Capital what that means is you learn that sometimes it's better to have more positions on and sometimes it's better to increase the size of your positions or use more Capital than you would normally do on certain positions you know you do one SPX strangle and you just used $120,000 yeah yeah like it is not that difficult to ramp up your size"
