  "we got a lot of questions we've done a lot of zero DTE um we've done a ton of zero studies we've done none with long buying strangles uh buying straddles buying strangles buying calls buying puts we've got a ton of emails saying hey show me the other side do you think you make or lose money by buying premium in um long zero day yes oh I mean I obviously if they go out to our area I'm to say no it's going to be it's going to be hard or or the the draw down would be too large um to sustain it to",
  "draw down would be too large um to sustain it to become profitable they go closer and they manage at a you've watched these you've traded them they move quickly I mean there are times to manage these for small $50 winners where maybe buying premium you know if you're Nimble could be okay in the zero days if you're close to the money surprising results are going to show that um sorry allergies um surprising results are I haven't seen this I don't know that um if you're very Nimble yes you can",
  "know that um if you're very Nimble yes you can make money oh okay cool go untight everybody's replaceable Tom everybody is replaceable everybody is replaceable zero DT Marketplace in liquid underlyings has been one of the most profitable arenas for retail traders in recent times at Tasty our preference for high probability trades leads us to make mostly making or mostly taking short premium positions in a two-sided efficient market Traders should be able to profit by using either short or long",
  "be able to profit by using either short or long options if aggressive management has been the key for success in selling Zer DT premium what kind of approach has been most successful for purchasers now I'm going to put a little bit of I don't know where they're going with this but I want to say it beforehand okay thank you for the CB for sponsoring all this if we're using mid price intraday let's just say there are times when you can't get filled at Mid price so some of these results I would",
  "at Mid price so some of these results I would skew them down a little bit just because you're going to have to give up a nickel to get filled on a we always say watch go to the next slide so um as you can see the last bullet point here is all trades were assumed to exercise at Mid price because long options are inherently defined risk no additional buying power reduction controlling options is required so you don't have to buy the wings but they're specific in here to make sure you understand",
  "specific in here to make sure you understand that you're probably going to give up a nickel off mid price very good I'm glad okay same thing 18 months worth of data we can purchase zero DT strangles at the market open using the 20 and 30 Delta we contrasted the performance of closing the winning trades if their profits exceeded a certain percentage or closing the losing trades if their losses crossed given um losses cross given percentages of their Max potential loss so we're trying to control",
  "Max potential loss so we're trying to control losses here do everything we can let's go to the um let's go to the next slide something fix this okay so the first thing is buying 30 Delta strangles that's buying the put and buying the call what's interesting here is that if you close them quickly for a profit of 10% now how much is a 30 Delta um caller put I'm going to guess it's probably going to be around boy I'm going to guess probably 12 premium you talking about yeah zero day yeah 30 Delta",
  "you talking about yeah zero day yeah 30 Delta yeah you're looking at well right now around five right now about five but what is it on the what do you think what is on the opening about seven or eight um maybe nine that's hard for me to say well you know what I'll go one day just so maybe we going to strap out it's about 1112 on each I'm going go eight or n okay eight or nine so 10% would be 80 C 77% chance Clos a 25% profit uh 67 um% chance 50% profit a dollar so so the daily p&l for managing",
  "profit a dollar so so the daily p&l for managing your winners um was was pretty positive on buying 30 Delta strangles um everything on this slide is good that I like the 67 you know 58% chance making a little money okay cool with that let's go next slide that's managing your winners that doesn't mean you can't be short the same thing and still make money either yep yep okay so this is if you try to manage your losers now this means make adjustments everything else and this is where you get into",
  "everything else and this is where you get into trouble it's really hard to manage your losers when you're trading short premium it's easy to manage your losers when you're Trading long premium it's really hard to manage losers yeah so the the first we always said this this is almost like your hedge when do you get out of your hedge EX exactly so so if you're managing your long premium trades at a certain percentage of whatever you paid for it that works but if you're trying to manage it andjust",
  "works but if you're trying to manage it andjust for losers oh that does not work yeah yeah look at these win percentages really bad let's go to next slide so it went to the 20 Delta strangles a little further out of the money and you still made money across the board you didn't make as much money and to be fair if you're going to buy the strangle you're better off buying the 30 Delta strangle than the 20 Delta because you you basically have higher percentages across the board and you make more",
  "percentages across the board and you make more money so you're better off buying the 20 the 20 Delta strangle if you go to the next slide Beth it's it's the losses for 20 Delta strangle yeah and you can see here if you tried to manage your losses o really rough 5% win percentage 7% 14% this is dark um this is dark well it is you can't manag the losses it's really hard so so that was that's the takeaway here managing winners possible managing losers impossible from a long premium side let's go",
  "impossible from a long premium side let's go to the next slide so over the past 18 month zero DT Traders could make money on either shorting or longing strangles that the market opened the key was using the right management mechanics I think we're the only group that's ever researched this at this kind of detail for long zero TT strangles managing losers was generally counterproductive long options are inherently downside limited already right so managing winners was effective but long premium",
  "managing winners was effective but long premium Traders still need to be patient and willing to accept a lower percentage of winning trades than short premium trades if you remember short premium was like 90 plus per. long was you know 70% but short premium um traders in order for their wins to be big enough to outweigh the losers and um so anyway it's an interesting um it's an interesting study because it shows that either side is if you have the right management mechanics right management",
  "the right management mechanics right management techniques um should be uh there's no set it and forget it in the zero day world that's really what it comes down to you can we usually live in a 45 day time frame and you know we always talk about managing a 21 days before exper have that time to I would have taken this to another level and I would have done it based on um the one the vix one day because the only reason I sold premium yesterday and it worked was because the vix one day was at 15",
  "it worked was because the vix one day was at 15 today the vix one day just going to look cuz you mentioned it today the vix one day is at 975 down 427 I wouldn't touch it with your money good work good work out of you good job nice real study here for people who trade those zero days we're going to take a quick 90 second break and come back with more tasty live after this time enough with your friend and mine Mr Scott Sharon tasty trade World Headquarters the number one brokerage firm in the",
