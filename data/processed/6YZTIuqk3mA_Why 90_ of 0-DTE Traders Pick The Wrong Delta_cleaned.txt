there it goes zero DTE throughout the day very nice let's get into it zero DTE options in the right underlying are fast liquid and highly accessible to retail Traders very fun to trade instant pain or instant gains extreme speed of the zero day Marketplace can easily leave Traders feeling like they missed their chance at a choice opportunity how have zero day short premium trades placed later in the day performed and are there reasons to prefer certain strikes at certain times what are you thinking watch your size in there don't do like like I did yes all right getting on to the next slide let's look at the study so we're using 20 months of data in SPX we're doing the zero days of course collected every 10 minutes examine selling zero day strangles using 20 30 40 and 50 Delta strangles and 50 is a straddle strikes at the market open so we're looking at 10 a.m. uh we're looking at the market open 10:00 a.m. noon or 1:30 all trades were managed if they reached 25% of the max profit losers and those that didn't reach 20 5% were allowed to expire of course SPX cash settled so this is no big deal everything that settles to cash at the end of the close all trades were assumed to exercise at Mid price and the cost of the buying power power controlling long strikes was neg neg neglected subtract 10 to 15% from daily peut subtract $10 to15 from daily p&l for more realistic results okay so we're talking about you know the spreads on the cloes because sometimes you spreads widen out and this this is also the problem with uh a lot a lot of back tests in general is that you have these widening out spreads on the clothes and SPX ticks for a couple minutes as well throughout the close so saying1 to $15 is how you can discount that yep yep yep all right so looking at it here we're looking at at the open straddles 40 Delta strangles 30 Delta strangles 20 Delta strangles give you the win percentage uh the win rate on those average p&l and then the the SAR which is our covariance of risk jump into the next slide here so we're looking at 10 and also these are strangles I didn't have as many strangles on because it uses way too much buying power I was buying wings and it was like $30 wide $20 wide $40 wide so a little bit different there too so looking at 10 a.m. this is what we got for the win percentages for all those above the average pnls you can see the 40 Delta strangles are obviously going to be be the highest p&l it also has um you know your highest your highest sear as well because you know you're right at the money there too uh same with the straddles there but pretty much the same thing I mean you're seeing the 40 Delta strangle actually increase profit potential uh from versus the open which is kind of interesting I guess you get you know a little bit of the back and forth price action maybe a change in volatility sure um that kind of helps you in that first hour or so sure sure better prices too probably better bit ass spreads sure I I'm GNA actually challenge the team to take a look at this maybe next time Tom is out again uh which could be never but let's uh let's maybe when he uh goes on one of his trips to uh Parts on foliage weekend foliage week or something like that that's next maybe looking at buying the 20ish Delta option we're buying the 15ish Delta option or buying the option that get that gets to $2 um on either side at the you know at some period of of time and seeing how how that performs I think we we need to present both sides because zero day is really all about Direction whether it be no Direction yeah I think we're going to revert back to the mean if you're playing buying the dip or selling the rip kind of thing um or we're going to continue on it really is a lot about Direction and I think basically what this is saying right now at least over the last 20 months um you haven't had a lot of directional movement over time um and the short premium strategies have been working at the beginning of the day but go ahead getting on to the next one so looking at noon uh you could see again the 40 Delta strangles kind of staying at the highest average p&l of course the highest risk as well and you're going to have this this tradeoff in any trade you do yeah you're always going to have higher potential wins uh with more premium you know with higher premium positions specifically those know higher Delta options but you're going to typically have more risk as well sure um same same thing here and then the numbers play out across the board too like the yeah they've all been good they've all they've all worked out you know from an average p&l St I think this is the more interesting one the last slide or the second to last slide here looking at 130 which is you know kind of the time I think where things start to move a little bit you know you throughout the day that that the first hour and the last hour of the day are the most liquid parts of the day and there there's many market dynamics that go into that from you know rebalancing of funds and and liquidating of of positions at the close that you don't want to take overnight I mean those are are market dynamics that lead to more liquidity at those points which is is interesting to see this you know being both the least profitable from a from you know your average p&l standpoint but the at the money straddles now don't they flip they flip they don't work and that's I think that's because of just the natural sort of uh for lack of better words tail risk that you have in the last like you know hour or so of trading where you know things can move real quickly and you're kind of seeing it here here you know those bigger meteor options the 40 Delta and the and the straddles are seeing a much higher risk and much lower you know average yeah the sear is basically staying the same across the board here on on the whole thing and you're right in the 20 Delta strangle where I was living was the wrong place to be yeah uh from from my own and and you're right I mean it goes back to that 30 40 Delta I think I'm closer to the 30 Delta because I was closer to the 20 Delta to begin with so I think the 30 Delta is where is where I go higher uh higher pop give up a little bit of of the p&l profit but uh I learned something today I knew the straddles would be tough but goad and that's actually a good point the sear kind of stays consistent throughout because we get that question all the time like is it should I do this trade at the open or wait 10 minutes or wait one hour or wait you know until noon or do it you know 10 minutes before the close from a risk perspective they're all kind of the same I mean you have that t risk like that is certainly there and you're going to eat that at some point you know that's going to happen uh but you know from a strategy perspective you'll be able to pick your you know your risk and reward based on what we presented here yep good stuff good next one please takeaways overall the past 20 months have been a good time for selling zero day premium using consistent initial Deltas I.E adjusting strikes for implied volatility and remain and remaining time into expiration gave very similar results as long as there were still few hours left in the trade not that this meant bringing strikes closer to atoney as the day goes on note that this meant bringing strikes closer to at the money as the day goes on this another important part that we didn't even touch on with the 40 Deltas they're much or all the delt right at the money basically you're right at the money so your strike selection is much much different MH by centering our mechanics on initial deltas and using percentage of profit targets we can adjust our Trading seamlessly regardless of when we place the trades and what the volatility environment is um been a good trade over the last 20 months I like it who knows if we're going to continue but all we can give you is the is the P lots of people on Twitter trading them yes iron Condor strangles straddles yep yep I see them I I watch you Johnny my my guy Johnny on there yep yep
