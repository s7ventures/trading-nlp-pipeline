welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today January 30th 2025 but first as I always do let's take a look at the market Emin S&P is down $7.75 NASDAQ down $76 you can see here the &ps have had a good $50 plus range today basically unchanged down eight after uh meta earnings and after uh which meta was significantly higher also uh Tesla earnings which Tesla was also significantly higher uh IBM was actually one of the biggest movers of the group if you can believe that up almost $30 this Market was a lot stronger but it's given back if not all of it so far today Russell up 19 and change that's your leader in the clubhouse and the Dow uh basically unchanged down four volatility surprising with the amount of movement we've had today that volatility is catching a small little bit here is near the high of the day of 17 but it is only up 5 cents keep an eye on volatility volatility starts creeping higher this downward move in the &ps and NASDAQ might get exaggerated uh bonds up 13 ticks after trading up to 115 bonds have had a good3 $4,000 move after making their lows uh just about two weeks ago back on January 15th I have no position in the bonds um I'm the world's worst commodity Trader all right what are we going to look at today well I think we have to do a post earnings trade now I full disclosure took off my Tesla position that I had on uh earlier today had it since last year it was one of my largest Losers of 2024 in 2024 for about nine or 10 months Tesla was one of my biggest winners and I gave it all back and some the last two or three months of 2024 but was able to get it all back and some today with Tesla coming inside the expected move closed all of that and uh well I'll show you in Tesla what's going on in there we'll look at these March uh options I was in the Feb options I'll show you the febs right now you'll notice here that my my puts at the time were the 390 puts you can see here that they're down $7 and change but the stock was up around 15 bucks the puts were down by $15 and the calls that I was short were only up a dollar it was a it would end up being a great trade sometimes you stay mechanical you get lucky stay mechanical out there boys and girls and get lucky too if you work the process work the process now I got to try to get the same thing in Goldman Sachs because Goldman Sachs was my other trade from 2024 that's left over um that that is giving me fits but here's the problem with Goldman Sachs Ivy rank is extremely low at 18 stock hasn't had a down tick the stock didn't cooperate at least Tesla had some back and forth action giving you a chance to put on some Deltas take off some Deltas Goldman Sachs has just been a rip your- face off rally I'm going to look to close my Goldman Sachs trade now take the loss in there because of the IV rank all right all that being said let's get to today's trade I'm going to go to Tesla even though it's had earnings look at this the ivx 5day change if you notice some of these other stocks that have had um uh earnings look at meta Ivy rank is down by twice as much and the I I'm sorry the ivx 5 day Chang is down by twice as much and the ivv rank is 19 Tesla Ivy rank is still 41 and the and the IV 5day adjusted is only down five so I think this move in volatility and again I talked about it when I was closing my trade on the show uh Ivy rank was in the 70s for Tesla prior to its earnings this morning it got into the low to mid 30s after the rally and now it's back up to 41 so expand a little bit after earnings even though it's got decimated for volatility I'm going to do a directional omnidirectional trade uh in Tesla March volatility is actually the same as fed volatility but you know with 21 days to go to expiration I'm going to look for March options that have 50 days with 45 days being optimal the March monthlies are the place to be at least in my opinion what did I do here I went and did a 1X two put ratio spread it's rare that you're able to go around these 15 Delta options it's rare because you need the implied volatility to be high I went around these 15-day options I bought the 335 puts one time I sold the 320 puts two times um I did this for $294 cents I believe wow this has really come in already let's check on the follow page if I have the right price here because it usually doesn't move that much that quickly let's go in here to just click on Bob the trader yes I did it at $2.94 with the stock just about $2 lower than where it is right now you'll notice this trade uh only has seven Deltas so if a stock moves $2 maybe this trade should be six or seven cents 8 cents 10 cents lower but certainly not uh 40 cents lower that's volatility Contracting by a lot here you can see the puts that I'm buying are down by $3 and change the puts that I'm selling are down by $2 in change that means this spread even from yesterday is in by another dollar I got $2.94 uh for this trade it does use um about $88,500 in buying power um so it does it is a trade that um requires uh a a sizable account I mean one that fits 8,500 bucks this is a $115 wide uh ratio spread it is rare to be able to go $15 $2 wide even on a $300 stock um which gives you a nice cushion or a nice uh um win uh area on your on your spread remember your break even is going to be this green line which is $15 below uh your 20 strike which brings you down to around 305 plus whatever credit you receive ceive on this uh it you'll notice my Delta is only seven yesterday's or Tuesday's TSM trade uh was was double uh that amount of Delta so it's a fairly delta neutral you can make as much as $1,500 on a 320 pin here but what do you really want Tesla to do you want Tesla to go up immediately if not sooner as you can see here um this credit Will contract that's what you want what's my goal on here like it always is around a buck buck and a half two bucks something like that if listen if this G goes down by a dollar in the next couple of days I would I would take it off but those playing in an IRA account this buying power effect is going to be closer to 30 some OD thousand so what would I do in that case I might go down to something like I don't know the the 220 puts um if you buy the 220 puts you'll change your your buying power ever so slightly here you go I'll take it off for a moment uh it's $8,300 well uh pretty much makes it the same oh because it's a margin account gotcha um you could change you could change your buying power uh by a multiple of of four or five times instead of being 30,000 it would be closer to $88,000 of course you do give up a little bit of that credit but you know what you freed up a lot of buying power by making that uh by making that I don't know what do you want to call it uh a wide uh ratio wide butterfly broken wing butterfly I guess you can call it that here's Tesla rallying well I hope you were able to watch this trade when I put it on in the follow page so that that you could have seen it in real time and not when you're uh watching the trade right now let me get to the follow page here I'm so sorry there we go um you'll notice here I put on my I took off here's where I took off my other trade Tesla right away when Tesla was up around $47 got lucky because this trade had a little bit of uh uh long Delta to it here here you got it the puts are down $14 calls are on only up I explained everything to have to stay mechanical sometimes you get lucky you'll see all the trades I do Marvell give me a little bit of fits today had to roll up the untested side gold continues to Rally had to roll up the untested side staying mechanical TSM uh even though I put on a bullish trade on there on Tuesday it's gone too far too quickly had to roll up the the puts and then here uh I made my trade right at 10 o'clock soon as we got off the uh the show I did an omnidirectional post earnings earnings have come out already they came out last night slight bullish because you want the stock to go higher even though you can make your max money at $320 which would be $1,500 plus the credit you receive wide put ratio spread again this trade has a 90 87% probably a success $12 a day in Theta Decay wow it's really uh coming off here now that the stock is rallying a little bit well hope you quote it Max profit $1,700 because it's $1,500 plus whatever credit you receive your buying power $85 bucks I think it really is less than that but I will check that out anyway my friends thank you so much for watching my podcast thank you so much for
