welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today December 17th 2024 man where has the year gone only a couple of weeks before the first of the year but Hey listen before we take a look at that trade let's take a quick look at what the Market's doing Emin S&P is down $25 and change and you can see we've been going sideways as of late volatility up ticking ever so slightly by about 18 cents but you can see here volatility kind of creeping up into tomorrow's fed announcement number on interest rates and really bonds have been where all the action is and I should say one thing since bonds are where all the action is TLT um has a dividend uh tomorrow so it goes X dividend tomorrow so you have to do something with your uh options today uh if you have in the money deeper in the money options you'll notice because there's such a low monthly implied volatility in TL l t and let's just say the dividends is around 40 if you have any options that are around the 87 strike or below um those are probably in Jeopardy of having dividend risk now if you don't know what dividend risk is I'm not going to go through that here today but please you can go in our archives just search dividend risk and a bunch of uh um archived uh um uh archive videos will come up and you'll be able to watch that and you'll know 15 minutes and it'll save your world but just to give you a quick little market maker hack here if the dividend is 40s you go to the corresponding put you go for the corresponding call to the put and you look for any put that's 40 cents or below the first put that's below 47 cents uh s sorry that's below 40 cents would be the 87 strike so every call option 87 and Below probably has dividend risk you can look at the open interest to see if I'm right on this um you'll notice so the open interest uh is around 3,000 on the 87s 1,000 177,000 on the 85s tomorrow that open interest should be close to zero if those options were exercised you can do the same thing uh if you want to look at like the de options with three days to go um you'll notice here that all of these options pretty much from the '90s and Below maybe the 89 and a halfs and Below should have exercise risk and you'll notice that these options will have an open interest of close to zero there's always a few stragglers but it'll be close to zero you can test my knowledge on my hack on what um the TLT dividend is going to be like but please let's get back to our regularly scheduled program where we're taking a look at the market and we're finding ourself um a little trade here what am I going to look to do I like to go to the high option volume list I like to to put the IV rank uh from highest to lowest I like to not put on on a trade that has earnings looming uh one stock that has hit my radar is NVIDIA Nvidia you'll notice has an ivy rank of 29 on the surface not as high as you would expect but you can see here that it's actually been uh creeping up into what seems to be its normal is range but the stock has really had a nice 10% move down um on that volatility contraction and now expansion so I'm looking to put on a trade in Nvidia but let's go over it here um you know what it' be easier if I just click on the uh earnings get rid of those so I have Nvidia up here it should be gray when I come up to um the Nvidia stock and there it is NVIDIA 129 just under down about $3 down another $3 another two and a qu% two and a half% you can see it's off of its lows closer to its highs for the day so it kind of missed a little bit from the lows but the ivx 5day change up 7.5% that's a big move and the IV rank 30 pretty good in this relatively low just off of its lows uh implied volatility uh rank or ivx so we've got expanding volatility over the last 5 days that means the options are higher priced than they were five days ago everything being relative and you have a relatively High IV rank in the stock I have a leftover free broken wing butter FY from the last time that I put on a trade in Nvidia let's see if we can do something similar today with this ratio spread I did a call ratio spread the last time I'm going to do a put ratio spread this time going back to what's been working for me in stocks that get beaten up with high implied volatilities that have been Market leaders buying the dip in here has worked this seems like a big dip in Nvidia for me I'm going to skew my trade to have a little bit more Delta because I'm a little bit more bullish on the trade then I am just putting on a delta neutral type 1X two ratio spread let me show you how I'm going to do that I'm going to go to closer to the 30th uh Delta option I'm going to buy one of the 121s we usually like to go four five six $5 is really my my number but I'm going to go a little bit closer I'm going to go to the 118s and I'm going to sell two of those I'm buying one of the 121s and selling two of the 118 now that's a relatively tight um ratio spread that's going to give me a little bit more Delta on the trade usually my Deltas on these trades are closer to 10 8 9 10 my Delta is going to be a little bit higher on here still 17 relatively small on each contract but because of that I'm going to get a higher uh credit on the trade I actually got a186 uh for this trade when the stock wasn't much lower than it is right now let me check it out where it was we can go to the follow page and you can see this trade on the follow page before you even see um this this video I did this at 10:07 this morning the stock was uh 12870 now the stock is one uh 129 so it's up a little bit my pop was 80% I got a credit I was correct of a186 so you can see those in real time um on the tasty trade platform when you open Move transfer your account or just aat transfer your account to tasty trade so let me go through the trade here I normally like to go a little bit wider The Wider you go for me the better off it is um your your your um area where you'll make money it'll be close to that one standard deviation range but your credit will be less so I wanted to collect the higher credit on the stock I've got a 79% Pop I like a pop that's over 65% my Theta on this trade is almost $8 7.76 that's $776 for my $3,800 um in uh buying power reduction that I have on this trade uh my Delta is 17 long shares so you got to be uh slightly bullish or omnidirectional on this trade stocks already down 10% I'm looking to you know catch a falling knife is that what they say your break even or your your your uh worry area is right where this screen line is just under 114 let's just call it 1145 how do I get to that well your long one of the 118 puts your short one of the 118 sorry long one of the 121 puts your short one of the 118 puts I know it says two here give me a minute that spread would be worth $3 plus the almost $2 that you received in credit the three plus the almost $2 you received in credit makes five that makes your break even $5 below or just under $5 below cuz we only collected a186 and that's where your green line is what's your max profit on this trade cuz it says $486 well if you get A1 86 credit and the stock is all over its place and the market doesn't look that great today so maybe the stock will sell off a little bit more but if you got a186 uh Credit in this trade and the stock and you held the position all the way to expiration which is 31 days away for me that's unreasonable but let's just go through the math this spread one by two since these 18 puts would be worth zero the 121 puts will be worth $3 you collected a $186 you can make a possible $486 $486 in trade what am I really looking to do I'm really looking to make a buck on this trade I'd like to make a buck tomorrow a nice three four five rally uh in Nvidia and those 17 Deltas uh will translate into about 50 60 Cent profit we go lower they'll translate into a uh smaller loss probably 20 or $30 loss so there is a little bit of Delta on this trade that I normally make but the pop is still good at 8 80% or more now you people trading in an IRA account this buying power reduction is going to be closer to 11 or $12,000 you want to put on this trade you don't have 11 or $12,000 in your IRA account well you're going to have to do a little bit of uh a little bit of a creative Finance here you're going to actually have to go out and borrow a little bit of your own money by buying one of these out of the- money puts it doesn't matter which one you buy it really depends on how much credit you want to receive and how much you want to reduce your buying power so for $20 over the next 31 days if you were to buy the 88 puts that's about 50 cents a day call it7 cents a Day 70 cents that's what that's what you're changing this whole trade by $70 uh on this whole trade right 70 cents uh you're able to excuse me 20 cents that's 70 cents a day that's how much it's costing you to change your $11,000 to $2500 in change that means you could take that seven or eight or $6,000 depending on what option you pick and do something else with it maybe put on another trade that has another 80% pot maybe take that money and put it into a a interest bearing uh stock like bil or esgv or anything else that you want to do it it maybe you just want to keep in cash waiting for another opportunity that's how you make your IRA account act like a margin account and leverage your own money by simply buying an out- of the money put to change this into a very wide one by two by one but really it's just taking that $20 that you're using and taking back seven or $8,000 of your own buying power I think that's pretty p uh pretty powerful what would my normal type trade if I was just kind of delta neutral on on this I would look to do a $5 wide spread on here with closer to an 85% pop and a Delta under 10 you'll notice credit is much less here at $70 so I wouldn't look to use that amount of buying power to make just a trade with $70 on the trade so my trade is the 121 put 118 put one by two I did it for a186 on this trade you can see the stock is rallying here and as for told it looks like we've moved about $20 or so all right ladies and gentlemen
