little disclaimer on what it is give us just your highlevel overview of the tool that we have in the pl platform it's like it's a stress test your position so we want to create something in the platform where client can look at the positions and see okay what if some happens right what if the market goes down 5% or my stock goes down up 10% or what happens if apply volatility goes up you know we want to be able to put those all things into a tool you can kind of see okay assess the risk and okay I'm okay with I'm okay with the risk maybe I'm not okay with the risk I want to do some stuff to offset the the losses right so and what's cool about the what you showed me yesterday is it's you can stress test your current filled positions from your positions tab but you can also put on kind of hypothetical what if situations like if if I put on the siren Condor let's throw this into the stress test and see how that might change and adjust my metrics yeah it takes in all your open positions right and then if we can Al create where you do some what if scenarios right and they also tell you where where the risk will be at in the risk raise beautiful beautiful let's jump to the next slide here so um when you're looking at kind of the features and we're going to show this all these are just kind of the ways that you can adjust all these uh inputs on the the risk analysis tool um you can get all of your positions on the risk analysis tool you can add new positions there's also like a span margin feature where you can look at if you're using Futures you can see that sort of uh change as well um just a little bit of about this and you'll be able to see both upside and downside in those uh changes so there the risk anal the risk array is in both sides of the market what happens if the the market itself goes up or down a certain percent as well as the changes in implied volatility yep and if you want to follow along while we go through these to get to this view to analyze this you just go to your positions tab on the desktop app click on the cap wreck button in the upper right corner and from there you can click on risk analysis uh and follow along and and kind of mess around with this as we go through it good stuff let's jump to the next one here so you can also change time inputs right so you have you have price by volatility time all these things can can be changed and adjusted you could and adjusted you could do that for the portfolio as a whole for new positions or for specific positions so you can you can change whatever sort of input specific to one position that you choose correct yeah we again we're using an option pricing model so we're taking those inputs in current price you know time to expiration everything else into the model right and then generating what the theic gains or loss would be on at different price points so you can see you can see exactly what will happen you know up 6% down 6% you know up 15% down 15% so you can see what the profit and losses are going to be like in JB Morgan you see that if we go down what 15% right with a stock right I lose six grand and then but then I make you know $1600 on the puts right so everything is getting offsetted as it get aggregated so you aggate the gains and losses right to determine on each price point determine what you're Expos OS is yeah and from here you can use uh percentage changes or you could use points so that's another way that you can kind of differentiate how you're analyzing the total portfolio or the positions within the portfolio uh and when you click that capar button you can either include everything in your portfolio or you can include specific uh positions that you have with those check marks before you click over to the risk analysis uh tab just next to it yeah nice part two is you can see we have price and IV so you can update that yourselves refresh it you can refresh refresh the prices you can refresh positions if you made a trade you want to make sure it's into the risk analysis to you click on positions to make sure this gets added yeah so clicking on any of those buttons in the upper left like price and IV price positions if you click on those buttons it just automatically refreshes it and makees sure that it's using up to-date information yep very good jump to the next one here so um the next slide two so we're looking at Greeks I believe is our next one here so um you can also change and see what changes in your in your Greeks based on all these situations so your Delta Theta bega show you how all of your positions change in those situations so by hovering over you know your specific um uh position step right you you you call them steps like so like each these you'll see the 1 2 3 4 and five at the top it's basically so if you have a 25% down move is what you're simulating each step is five 5% down to give you an idea of like you know along the way what your risk or reward is on both sides of the market but it'll show you your changes in in Greek exposure as well all along those steps going down yeah we want to make those stes equal you know equal distance to each other right and then I mean you can go in there and if you want man you can Al also change it too on on the left- hand side on on the percentages but yeah and the Greeks part is we're calculating the Greeks for each position right based on the current implied Val right and then you know also we we also roll up to Apple first uh aggre greets too so take all the positions offset offset the Greeks right and give you aggate for Greeks for each position too on the headings for Apple yeah I think especially with uh portfolio margin accounts it's important to understand how buying power can change with moves in the market with moves in IV and this kind of really helps you get a good understanding of how that might change in events that we're not foreseeing like the Japanese Yen unwind that that caused a lot of buying power changes with people that had bullish positions in the markets uh this is something that you can kind of utilize to synthesize a similar move or uh you know something more dramatic or less dramatic yeah and a great price too is like you say the field price too show them when when we put these inputs into an option pricing model right here's what your the price could be for the calls and puts right so the option pricing model is calculating you know theorical prices of your calls and puts to tell you okay where that if I sell that put at a dollar you know it goes to $7 right that that's the difference that's how you figure out the gains and losses on the position right so that's kind of nice you can see everything in there so we want to make displays that are transparent right yeah it doesn't any good if you do a stress test on a on a Monte Carlo model you know 10,000 simulation what's that gonna do for you right what you want to do is be able to see yourself right call out Dr Data his Monte Carlos well he can come in and show all 10,000 simulations but the good point here is that the clients can you know see everything our models are transparent and then they can do their own you know what if scenarios you know to see if they're comfortable with the risk or not right yeah and I think uh like going back to that an example that happened earlier this year the Japanese done unwind like uh I'm sure a lot of the conversations that were had on the margin desk were like okay I'm short this put in the E Min futures or I have this bullish position in the E Min Futures my buying power has expanded how can I mitigate this or how can I hedge this risk and that's where you can really bring in like okay if I buy this put two weeks out for further out of the money how is that going to affect my position how's that going to affect my buying power and that's where you can really uh adjust the Greeks and bring it in and let's jump to the next slide because that talks about that functionality and so you know one of the things that you can do is you can add in legs trades up to whatever uh you can up to four legs because that's the maximum order routing but um you can add on simulated trades or trades prior to you actually getting filled and placing you know placing them and getting filled on those trades and see how that will change or affect the risk parameters in your portfolio um as you go along so this is a really cool tool for as Mike said like if you're looking to hedge your portfolio I want to hedge um 10% down move or a 10% down move with a 20% pop in volatility you can simulate that via this um you know risk array yeah I mean to Mike's Point it's great for you know clients calling in trade desk they can send them to this tool so they can look at their risk right instead you know in terms of they can see what their losses and gains are and two is like for if you have like in JB Morgan if you have if you're have a hedge that's expiring today right well now you know to replace that hedge right so you know to offset the risk right so it's nice nice about that is you can see what happens with your hedge oh hedge expiring today you know am I comfortable with 10 grand of RIS maybe I'm not you know down %. so now I can replace that hedge right and then that kind of shows you what how that cut reduces your uh theorical losses love it love it let's jump to the next slide here um so for the price percentage changes so you can look the the way you can look at this is that you can have them based on uh just all of them together which is uncorrelated right so that's basically just saying across the board everything is down 20% right moveing everything you know the same uh price move for all symbols for all symbols beta waiting does it to spy so explain a little bit what how that how that functions yeah so I mean obviously spy everything everything beta weights a spy you know now we out functional you can spy you can actually ba we to other symbols too in this example you know spy obviously is is how everything is is looked at right and so if you have a a beta of two right meaning that you have a high beta stock right so if the SPX goes up you know down 10% that stack go down 20% right so what we're doing by probing the vaa beta is like a multiplier for the stress so you're you're say okay this if if SPX go 10% you have a two beta your symbol go down 20% we're going to show those 20% losses in terms of of the stress test yep so it and that's a really cool feature because it takes all of your positions not only the size but the correlation so like it'll account for the fact that um you know gold and silver have a low beta right if if any beta you know positive or negative correlation as well to spy so it doesn't just you know nuke everything 20% that feature allows you to take your portfolio as a whole and puts it you know together under beta weting that's why we always talk about dat waiting our positions and using that as like a risk met metric you'll see that in the risk array when we when we demo through and again like we're talking about transparent you can see the betas on the left hand side you know and then if you want to change it you can always change you can change your your stress test too like you know like the betas you can you can change your price move right to to where you think it should be you know so which is nice same with implied vals you can go in there and change them separately too so we made it or clients can make their own changes too it's not just you know what our we we think everything should be you know we're making it functionality scalability so you can do yourself yeah you can really like edit anything right and you can get super granular like you can say this position goes down 20% and volatility expands 10% and you could say this one doesn't move like you right if you have different options on different series you may take down janv Val you may take up dval you know I mean whatever you want to do it you can do your own little changes on your vow right to see how that affects the option pricing model yeah and especially if you're using the beta we to feature you can like we've talked about you it's default to spy but you could change it to something like the q's like maybe you think if there's going to be a big move in the market maybe it's Tech that leads that or drags the market down you can change the beta weighted symbol from Spy to the cu's and see how those figures change jumping over to the next one here we're talking about the IV um changes that you can do give me a little bit of a explanation between points and percentage right so we did it we had two ways of doing it one you can do percentages so if you move IV 20% it's going move each individual option IV by 20% right yeah okay IV shift is just moving everything that that by the same imply Val move so let's let's say that vix rout now is like 15 let's say we want to do like a 50% uh of the vix right so let's say seven points s half points you can go there and go and take go iy shift and go seven points it'll move each one individual imply vales seven points so your imply vales a 30 it goes to 37 your imply vales of 40 it goes to 47 so there's different ways where you want to do in terms of how you wanted to U program your imply volatility shocks you know and so that's where you made it so you have different ways looking at it and again you can do that on the as the group as a whole or each individual option you can even get goofier and go and change you know whatever option implied volatility you want specific option specific position correct yeah really cool um jumping to the next one here so um so this is for points so points you g you gave us that already so points does the position as a whole correct so it moves everything the same so if you have apple vow or Tesla vow it's can move everything seven points you move everything seven points all right give us our take away we'll finish up the slides and we're going to get right into it and we'll give you your disclaimer so we make everything all kosher here you know we try um so the taste trade risk analysis tool is designed to offer comprehensive and dynamic insights into your trading portfolio allows traders to be their best Risk Managers I like that we we have great ones here but you should be a good one as well uh allows you better understanding of how different scenarios impact your trading portfolio and positions and you can make informed adjustments to your positions to optimize your risk reward profile give me my disclaimer and then we're jumping into the platform definely fantastic again if you got questions put them in the YouTube chat Mikey's going to be throwing those our way as well um but we want to show the platform um and the feature itself we're going to have you walk through change in some stuff adjusting some stuff so um we will do that once we get this platform up yeah um while we work on that David asking what's the current Apex 40% down Market multiplier today is it five or 6% of a account that lick you know what he's talking about so about a year and a half ago they uh do know what he's talking about I don't know that man knows everything that's an encyclopedia with a with a mouth so uh OCC came out with uh stressing clearing firms so there is a down 40% number they use for firms in terms of how much that they put up Capital right and so then we've hit since they hit us and we have to Apex had trickle down the clients where where we have we have to imply a 40% number to their portfolio rate and then we get a function of their net L to exposure so you know I think six or seven ratio is kind of where we're at right now so there you go David you tried to stump the schami remember that remember that show it was with um Johnny Carson no it's uh Burman Chris Burman CH whoop oh yeah yeah yeah like he used to have a sport I thought it was a sports show well you didn't get them but it was a good question um all right so we're going to get into it so on the portfolio page on the platform you'll see in the upper right hand corner this Capital requirement button you click on that and it'll give you your risk arrays here all the things that you can change you can pick which positions you want to include you could have them all here which is what I had selected you can select specific positions I just go in here randomly click a couple it'll show you only those positions we're going to get into it here we should have some fun with it and just use all the positions but uh might lessen it if we have to so when we get in here give me a a scenario and show me how to put that in here better yet I'm going to give you a scenario I want you to tell me and walk me through how we do that so let's say the market goes down or let's do our Price p our price change of 10% we're going to say IV goes um from a vix of 15 which we're at right now let's say 25 how would I make those adjustments and show me some of the things that I'd see so we would go into override right okay and click on uncorrelated and we're going to make that 20% right okay so that now that we're going to say everything goes down 20 everything goes down 20% everything goes down 20 % okay then we go IV shift and now if we can do a couple things if we want to go you know we can move the uh IV shift points is seven points relative to the vix relative so 50 if you take a 50% move right so goes to uh you say 15 to 25 25 so 10 points we can we can you know we can move it up 10 points okay you know and then that will move all the imply valves up 10 points on each one of these uh symbols or we can just do like a 20% move you know however however you want to do do it you know cuz I mean 15 to to 30 that's a that's a big move right so I mean we can go up by 50% in case you want to do that and take the IV shift and go up 50% percentage moves 50% okay so it's a big one big that's a big one okay you know so just going to take each individual imply valow and move it by 50% so if you have a uh a 30 imply Val right that goes to 45% right so everything gets moved and this is looking at so on both and each one of these positions you can see the the change in the in the profit or loss based on each of these moves correct what's cool is that it gives you both sides of the market obviously on an up you know this implied volatility if you were thinking that it was going to be an up move there's no input to say like up 20% or down 20% they give you both if you were thinking that this was an up move you would probably say that volatility wouldn't change here or would go down you could adjust this to be down 10% and that'll change your risk profile you'd be looking on the on the right side of this risk analysis so you can change both the the array shows you both directions of whatever your inputs are in terms of the market moving that direction um but it also gives you it gives you the upside and the downside for both those correct and if you want to make changes like I receive indexes right you know we go up the Val then comes down right so you can make some changes to that right because you know obviously uh in index is you know Mark goes down B goes up right you know so you can make those own changes too on that too but yeah I mean you can go around there make your own uh what you think a a reasonable one day move is right you know so you know it maybe a 5% move 7% move right and then what's a reasonable uh imply valti he moving on one day right you know and then kind of put that in there I think one of the next things we're goingon to go have on there we're going to actually take some his historical dates and put into risk analysis I I was telling that before where we might take a 2020 Co day uh we might take the uh 2008 banking crisis so we're going to have some historical Market events and we're going to put down risk analysis to see how your position would have done through those days so we're taking those price moves and those volatility moves so Dr data's got the data for me that's so we working on that so you'll be able to to be like give me a OA crash scenario or covid crash scenario just automatically yeah and that's really powerful because this is a complex tool and it's you like we've we've spent minutes 10 minutes here learning how to use it we haven't even scratched the surface so much and that's that's really powerful because a lot of people like we obviously don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or in the couple of days like jpow could go on today and say oh our our 25 base point cut that everyone's expecting we're actually raising rates like something could happen Market goes crazy but if you have a benchmark like the covid crash or financial crisis or whatever now you can see okay my position is way too big or you know oh I could do this to hedge this risk if something like this were to happen uh so I think that's really powerful and the other you can also I know you shown how to simulate a trade too yeah on the platform we can also do that let's let's add that in there too so um I actually I was showing too that you can change the date of when this situation happens and so I just mve this to like early January uh just to show that as well and the the platform will adjust for positions like this Natty gas position I have that's expiring in a couple days it's gone so it's off it'll simulate all those things like it'll take off positions that expired or or you know uh it'll account for the time change as well all those things come into play here um just going through those yeah we're just plugging those inputs into the option price Model and it's how we're getting the theorical value the calls and the puts yeah so why don't we go and let's see you want to put a yeah pick one of your positions and throw on like a new position and then we can we can bring that in you don't have to get it filled you can just put it on and we can bring it in to simulate how that would adjust okay let's do um like AMD put on a put spread there this morning so we'll do the one I did for Johnny trades um we go to the cap requirement and I'm going to just I'm going to just isolate that position just so we can see it here so the risk analysis this is what I have on right here yeah then you have the add the trade in the upper right in the upper right hand corner it's going to add whatever I just put on there as well so you don't right you don't have to send the trade you don't have don't send don't send a exchange you can go in there create the trade here in a risk analysis and look at it before you want to send it and so this is showing that short put spread that I just added on um into the risk analysis so it gives you an idea and just to take that back um you could see you know I've got a little bit of risk to the downside obviously profits to the upside because I have some long Delta there if I add on this put spread you have to recreate oh I got to redo it I'm sorry so if I go to the page uh I put this back on go to the cap requirement add the order legs you see now I have this downside risk because I'm adding a put spread to an already long Delta position it just adds in all the inputs that you that you know you're putting in that trade yeah you can change all these so I want to also isolate too all the things that you can change in the input so if you hover over any part of this uh section it'll allow you to to change the price of the underlying so I could make my own manual um price change here and let's say it goes to 97 let change that value you can change the implied volatility of each option itself you could do it of the whole thing of all those options here you can see it's changing all those implied volatility so all those things are at your will to yeah we want to make some where you can make your own changes right we don't want some that's static right to here here the predetermined levels right we want you know clients to be able to be interactive and be able to decide what they want and again you know nice to know this like you know if clients have any suggestions they want to see you know let me know because we're always working to enhance our models so they see something they like to see in Risk analysis you love to see you know what they're what they think and everything else so I want to add so that we can because I don't have that many Futures I just have a m micro Euro and a Natty gas butterfly that's basically going away um so let's go in here and just put on a short put in es and just see how that you know affects my portfolio and we'll go into the span margin scenarios as well because it's another cool feature here so I'm going to go back here I'm G put my whole position in there we're going to add the short putut so you can see it's obviously a huge effect on my positions because it's a big position relative to everything else you know you have a short put in es it's you know much bigger position than my little Johnny trades that I have on here um when we go to the span margin uh scenario uh oh can we add the new position no it's got it's got to be a fill position okay but if you hover over it I'll show you something that's pretty cool on our span margining okay if you hover over the initial requirement it we'll break down to where it's coming from in terms of the span model so take your cursor and just there go we're going to we're going to put it I'm going to just put on a put spread so we'll do the oh yeah we'll do a wide put spread here just so we can show this um so we'll do this wide put spread out of money put spread we'll put this on okay so when we go to the positions we'll go to the capital requirements section so click on report to refresh it okay report this will refresh it got my auto Refresh on there too oh yeah so what can I change so so if you hover if you hover if you hover over initial requirement M with your cursor you should see that so it kind of tells you where it's coming from what's so span has 16 different scenarios you know and so volatility price yeah volatility uh volatility unchange up and down and then price moves so they basic time too right well they take basically they take what a one- day move would be let's say for ES is 5% right okay so they they take 5% uh and they move it uh a third 2/3 3/3 so they they break it up to you know so so full move would be 5% then they break up into a third of five% two3 of 5% 5% and they apply a I think a 40% imply Val shock to it okay you know and then scenario 15 and 16 they take the price move was 5% they times it by three they become 15% and they take a third of those of of the of losses as a requirement so they so it's it's but we can break that uh snar down through our risk analysis meaning we have the inputs there to put into it to mirror what uh spam margin be look we're looking at but it's kind of nice you can kind of tell like from where where it's coming from Scenario 14 you know we know that's that's the full 5% move right and so we can kind of recreate that to show you where the risk is coming from and these are the see I want to try and put this on as a I'm gonna make this a naked position so that because I want to see the crazy changes do they account for limit up and limit down moves or is is that kind of like the same thing yeah I mean they they have a circuit breakers in place right okay I'm going to make this as wide as possible so we we wanted to take out the the black model of span and be able to put to to be able to put on risk analysis so we can kind of show like you know what other they're looking at it so yeah so just another nod to uh Clarity and transparency around like how these things are actually being calculated right all right I want to make this wider so we can see just I'm trying to do it with my limited capital on this account you're going to be putting a margin call right away like guys here that's true you could you could iners you know that's how they did it back in the day you get Tony Batista and he would uh he'd come to your door with a baseball bat that was how they did uh margin calls back in the day all right so we got I got a I got a wide put spread here in es what am I seeing and if you and if you scroll down if you go to the far right where those arrows are it'll kind of tell you where it's coming from so scenario 14 or 16 now scenario 16 I'm yes so that's so that's that's taking the price moving moving to 300% like I said before it's going from taking it say one day mov 5% to 15% and then they're cutting a third of that as uh those losses as margin so that so that's three consecutive 5% yeah so 15 yeah 15% in the market as a whole it's a whole right so basically saying from 300% move means it goes from 5% to 15% take those those those losses haut highcut those losses that's going to be a Marin requirement and I think this is really important especially for I know there's some people that are you know selling puts in mini Futures uh this will help you understand like the true size that you can absorb like if you're doing one or two contracts but you're but you're way over Lev levered from a notional value standpoint this will show you how much you can truly absorb like if you have a a one day two- day move where it's you know down 10% 15% and you can't absorb that then that's problematic and you need to do yeah you go to risk analysis's can I do this for Mees well let's go let's go to risk analysis real quick and then uh so we should be able to see that on there on the on the capital requirement no just go risk analysis and then just put on ES oh you just want to do es yeah so take everything else off see how close we are so we have the 20% down with a 50% pop involv yeah so take everything off and just just make it a uh 15% move down oh I have AMD in there too 15% okay and then take off the Val shock okay so we're going to do this at basically no V yeah so you know so that's kind of how they they look at it in terms we have to take off AMD but it's fine yeah they're doing 55% but going to cut about a third of that for the margin requirement so and that's that's 50 is here correct correct what what's this yellow box I had saw a question from so the yellow box is just basically it's just telling you where the larg largest loss is coming from so on the risk Ray we we put the the colorcoded just client telling the client okay we're it's coming from step five right so the client can see where the large loss is coming from and it does it so like on this AMD position at a certain point cuz my position would basically be zero it basically tells you this position is at its Max correct if you have like spread trades or if you're you know long calls or long call spreads or whatever and the market drops those call spreads go to basically zero there's no more loss after that correct correct so it's kind of nice it's a way of us you know we kind of like to make the colors more more like a heat map kind of look to it you know yeah so you know clients can see it and we want to make sure they can it's easy to see right easy to read right so
