  "Mario, we are looking to do a Jan/Feb ratio swap. You want to sell two Jan straddles and buy one Feb straddle. The stock is trading at 120. The ratio is 2 to 1, with a credit of $6, but it actually came out to $5.93. Let's go ahead and make the trade. Remember, the higher the credit, the better."
