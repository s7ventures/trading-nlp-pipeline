  "what's up everyone and welcome to the life cycle of a trade we're going to take a look at three trades an iron Condor a short put spread and a call diagonal [Music] spread what's up everyone today is a big day in the market so you've got Invidia earnings after the close today e Min is right now uh down nine points we're we bounced all the way back we're basically at at highs here just to sco off the all-time highs here for today rather than going into envidia directly which I already have a",
  "into envidia directly which I already have a position on I'm going to go into SMH SMH is the semiconductor ETF uh it is a has a 22% waiting of Nvidia within the ETF so a very big portion of this ETF is going to be exposed to Nvidia earnings after the close today along with uh some of the you know the other uh semiconductor stocks within the basket so you will have some exposure you will have some height and volatility here you can see IV rank is 69 it's pretty liquid it's not the most liquid",
  "is 69 it's pretty liquid it's not the most liquid underlying you can see it's 20 to 30 cents wide which isn't bad for a $200 stock but it's not exactly great um but it is it is liquid enough to trade and I want to get a little bit of that exposure to some of the height and volatility into Nvidia earnings so we're going to just do it an iron Condor here try and sell some premium out of the money try and capture some of that um we usually look for around a 20 Delta on the short options just to",
  "around a 20 Delta on the short options just to give you an idea of where that is so we'll call it the 220 on the put side on the call side we'll say the 275 uh in terms of how much risk we we typically allocate I usually do 10 maybe 15 points wide in terms of the spreads on either side that totally depends on your own risk tolerance um for me I'm going to go $10 wide and just see what this trades at it should trade somewhere around onethird the width of the strikes here we go it trades at about",
  "of the strikes here we go it trades at about $3.25 or so here which is roughly onethird the width of the strikes you can see it's a $6 or $667 total risk 660 some odd dollar buying power you've got a 57% probability of success when you collect 1/3 the width of the strikes it usually sets you up with a 60 % 50 to 60% probability of success when you collect somewhere around that uh just to give you an idea of where our risk would be so 220 and 275 are our short strikes so it' be roughly down here",
  "are our short strikes so it' be roughly down here and 275 would be basically at the highs on the upside so just a delta neutral trade here trying to play into that high implied volatility that we're seeing in the space along with that binary event that we have after the close here so I'm going to put this in at 330 right at the mid price see if we get filled uh um we could always cancel and replace that there we go 330 filled on our SMH iron Condor next trade that we're going to look at is this",
  "next trade that we're going to look at is this SMH position so we've had a nice V contraction we've had a little bit of a bounce which is what we needed here uh and this position has gone from $3 in uh $33.30 credit down to a mark of about A180 so about $150 profit we'll see if we can get filled on that position when I'm looking to get out of some of these positions one of the key things that I look for is the long options so when you're looking at your options if the long option has no bid",
  "at your options if the long option has no bid meaning it's worthless like if we were looking on the upside and we had a long option that was at you know 330 or 335 that's a penny at 7 cents offer those options are going to be very hard to fill because they're nearly worthless so we don't have this problem here because all of these options have value you can see there's a little bit wider of Mark here so uh that might mean that this Mark that we have currently we might have to adjust the price",
  "have currently we might have to adjust the price up or we probably will have to adjust the price up but all these options have value so not worried about getting out of this position all together so we'll try and get filled right here at the mid price free up some Capital another uh another key of managing positions so there we go we got out 183 $147 on that one so that was a nice little trade [Music] all right so as you can see we are very light on positions here so looking to put on a a",
  "light on positions here so looking to put on a a couple trades today I mean one of the things that has really stuck out to me is this move in oil all sorts of geopolitical stuff going on you had OPEC talking about pulling back um production and and all sorts of stuff happening in the oil markets oil has dropped from the mid 7s or high 70s all the way down to you know the 60 handle which we haven't really seen for most of 2024 oil Futures themselves are very very big contract it's it's a",
  "themselves are very very big contract it's it's a thousand uh uh the multiplier is a th000 so for every point if you were long or short the oil Futures it's $1,000 so it's a very very big contract and you can actually see the leverage that you get here is very very significant it only uses 10 10 grand or n Grand here to be long or short the Futures now in this account I certainly cannot do that because that is uh too way too big of a position but I can trade the options so the options actually",
  "I can trade the options so the options actually trade in the same notional as these the uh the Futures right so a a $100 $1 option is really ,000 in terms of value in terms of credit that you're selling a spread then if you were to do a onepoint wide spread is going to be notionally equivalent to $1,000 it's a it's $1,000 per point it's a one point wide spread so when you're looking at this spread a credit of 18 cents is $10 per point or $10 per tick I should say so at $10 per tick at an 18",
  "per tick I should say so at $10 per tick at an 18 Cent or so credit is going to equal $180 in terms of actual value you can see here uh for this spread and I just pulled this spread up it's around a 20 Delta I'm actually going to move it a little bit closer to get a little bit higher credit but just for an example when you look at this spread Max loss is going to be $800 of course that's the the rest of the risk if you're selling this at near 20 cents it's going to be 80 cents of risk which is",
  "cents it's going to be 80 cents of risk which is $800 $20 in credit the one interesting thing with Futures is that you'll see that your buying power effect is actually going to be lesser than the m loss to start for that position and this is because of span margin so span margin allows extra relief on uh and is specific to Futures contracts in that it calculates a risk uh based on a number of factors from days till expiration it incorporates volatility it incorporates how close to at the money",
  "it incorporates how close to at the money you are so this will certainly change we can even just pull up just to give you an idea of like a closer at the money spread is going to use about $200 more in buying power just because it's closer at the money has a a higher Delta um you know the time aspect is the same because we're looking at the same expiration but just to give you an idea of the the risk here and the potential for changes in the buying power it won't exceed that Max risk though so",
  "power it won't exceed that Max risk though so when you trade a spread in a Futures Contract you will not go above your max risk parameters there in terms of your max loss so for a spread I'm going to take a little bit extra risk here go around the 30 Delta I want to collect around onethird the width of the strikes this is a little bit less here at $2 or at uh uh 25 cents or 26 Cents depending on where I get filled here I want to get around that onethird the width of the strikes because it puts",
  "onethird the width of the strikes because it puts us at that 60 to 80% probability of success depending on what your credit is so we're going to see if we get filled here at 26 Cents and work the order from there uh It's a 65 strike for the short 64 for the long we're going 43 days out in time into the October 17th expiration so we'll do this at 26 Cents see if we get filled here no fill there of course we can cancel and replace that we'll go to 25 see if we get filled we are in 25 cent credit",
  "25 see if we get filled we are in 25 cent credit which is a $250 uh credit on the spread it's got a width of $1 so our risk will be 750 bucks uh just playing for a little bit of a bounce in oil all right so we are having a fantastic morning in the Johnny Trader portfolio today we've got e mini S&P 500 futures up 90 points you've got the NASDAQ up 475 the Dow's up significantly the Russell's up significantly oil's up it's been a great day for our trading uh we did just have the uh rate cut",
  "our trading uh we did just have the uh rate cut decision that happened yesterday lots of volatility priced into that event Market has responded significantly to the upside here got a bunch of positions that we need to close out and these positions they haven't needed really any management to them um they've worked out since the beginning and and you know it's just time to start managing positions when you are are managing a portfolio you want to get long into lower prices and sort into higher",
  "get long into lower prices and sort into higher prices and as you get in this case a market rally and a lot of things start working in your favor with short premium you only have a certain amount of profit that you can make on your positions you have capped profit potential and as you get closer to expiration and as profits are on the table you can only make so much more so at a certain point you have diminishing margins of return so when we have these sort of moves in the market and we have a",
  "these sort of moves in the market and we have a bunch of things work in our favor instead of trying trying to get every last p penny out of the positions we tend to manage winners and that's a key to what we do in our trading uh portfolio So today we're going to manage winners we're going to take off some Delta exposure we're going to take off some risk into what has been a fantastic uh morning here and couple weeks so first position that we're looking at is actually a Futures position that we",
  "looking at is actually a Futures position that we put on in oil so oil Futures it's been just a a couple weeks here I mean we kind of painted the bottom here when we're looking at it it was at about 70ish I'm sorry about 66 68 is so we've had about a $2 rally in the oil Futures it's been exactly what we needed here uh this put spread it's out of the money we got some we had some long Delta the stock has gone up we're going to take that long Delta off again this is getting short Delta so to",
  "Delta off again this is getting short Delta so to speak in that we are taking long Delta off into an up move in the oil Futures it's exactly what you want to do you want to you want to take off long Delta as you you know get that move higher so we're going to try and get out of this for a 13 C debit which is actually uh would be a $130 debit because the multiplier here is uh is 10 on the oil Futures here so a $13 a 13 cent debit is really $130 in value this will net us out about $120 profit",
  "in value this will net us out about $120 profit depending on where we get get filled here let's put it to 14 and see if we can just get filled here get this one off the table we'll try 15 cents there we go so we got out for an even $100 profit nice little trade in the oil Futures uh we've had a couple of those recently so nice little trade [Music] there all right so so looking at one of the biggest stocks in the world uh Nvidia here uh we've had some two-sided action in the markets NASDAQ is uh",
  "some two-sided action in the markets NASDAQ is uh is down 40 here you got the E minis up to volatility Futures I should say getting up to 19 it's near the high uh here over the last two sessions we got into the 20ish handle definitely been some volatility in the markets here so Nvidia has had all sorts of bad PR over the last couple sessions after earnings so you had earnings it kind of opened inside the expected move you had some weakness in the market and the week you had some weakness on",
  "the market and the week you had some weakness on Tuesday you had this whole subpoena thing come out Nvidia has fallen all the way back down to 106 I think it's time to take a little bit of long Delta here into this move um so one of the trades that I like to do to get a little bit of Delta is a diagonal spread and usually if I'm doing a a longer duration trade trade I'll go somewhere for the 30 to 40 day for the short option on the on the long option going somewhere around the 70-day expiration",
  "going somewhere around the 70-day expiration if you want to do this shorter term you certainly could do an October September spread but I'm looking to take this a little bit more duration and kind of play into um uh giving myself a little bit more time to be right so if I'm going to November here I typically Buy around a 40 Delta option so we'll call this the 115 strike which it was trading at at the start of yesterday so it's had a big big move to the downside so the 40 Delta is going to be",
  "to the downside so the 40 Delta is going to be our our long uh Delta also our positive gamma position in the October expiration I'm going to sell around a 20 Delta against it so somewhere around the 120 125 is Mark something like that to add a positive Decay component and also to reduce the cost of the trade I want to get these costs down to5 6 $700 which is what my risk tolerance is normally in this portfolio so I'm looking at because I got a little bit extra Delta on this 115 I'm going to",
  "a little bit extra Delta on this 115 I'm going to sell this 125 it sets it up for a $463 debit uh when you look at this on the analysis mode the curve you can see that you have um a pretty sizable potential profit if we do get back back to you know that 115 to 125 Mark we can even use the analysis mode to kind of simulate time and you'll see how this risk profile changes as time passes even if you go all the way to the November expiration U I'm sorry the October expiration uh that'll basically",
  "sorry the October expiration uh that'll basically simulate all of the premium coming out of this option because it would be expired here on October 18th uh $2 and so of extrinsic value is what I would capture from that if we did get a rally uh this would all be intrinsic value the extrinsic value in the short option would Decay you'd get the best of both worlds of course you give up some of the profit potential if you explode higher but I'm not worried about giving up the tail with uh in",
  "not worried about giving up the tail with uh in exchange for getting some positive Decay on my side which is what I'm doing with that short option so we're going to try and get filled here $479 is what we'll route it at the mid price or just a penny above the mid price here and see if we get filled here there we go we got filled so we got filled on this called diagonal spread we're long the 115 in November short the 125 in October expiration leans about 20 Deltas longish here into uh what has",
  "about 20 Deltas longish here into uh what has been a very very steep drop in Nvidia so we'll see if we can get a bid in Nvidia over the next couple weeks manage this for $100 to $200 profit here the next one we're going to look at is a big profit a quick profit that we had in Nvidia we bought the dip in Nvidia this was trading on the fourth is when we got into this position you can see we we got in right around the lows of 10 105 is on that position we can actually look at the market snapshots",
  "we can actually look at the market snapshots give you a re a exact number about 106 70ish 75ish so the stock has with the of the market moved significantly higher and it's time to go for this position this call diagonal spread we were long the November call the 115 strike call we were short the 125 call and just to give an idea of of you know just the value of this call so it's only been about two weeks and this option we originally sold it at $240 into what has been a very very big rally in",
  "$240 into what has been a very very big rally in Nvidia from 106 to almost 120 uh over the span of two weeks this short call only cost us about $160 based on where it's marked now so we get the question all the time of like why not just buy the call or why not just buy the put and play the other you know play for that directional move had we not gone up $15 or $14 in two weeks this option would have hedged us some it would have hedged us a dollar $2 depending on where the stock went went if it",
  "$2 depending on where the stock went went if it went lower it would have hedged us to the downside we would have saved $200 in value instead of losing that $200 in value here into a rally it's a what we would call a high class problem we played the upside we had a lot of long Delta we had positive gamma on our position it was exactly what we needed for this position um and so it's a high class problem in that instead of making $300 on the position or $400 on the position I'm only making you",
  "or $400 on the position I'm only making you know or I'm sorry instead of making $500 I'm only making $300 on this position you know 75% uh return on Capital huge huge win so you know in hindsight of course did this impede some of my profit potential yes if we had gone down it would have been a blessing it would have saved me $200 so you know you don't you can't play for the unknown of the future we just trade what what is is there we were buying the we were hedging that that dip buying with a",
  "the we were hedging that that dip buying with a short premium position in the shorter duration it's exactly what we wanted to happen here got the bounce time to go here take a big big win and Patch yourself on the back we're going to try and get uh 395 credit here put us at a 300 and change profit no fill there put this down two pennies and there we go $795 we actually got price improved $316 profit on that one so we just took off $2,000 in buying power or more uh we booked some winners of5 or",
  "power or more uh we booked some winners of5 or $600 a really nice day and week couple weeks for us in the Johnny Trader portfolio so just taking off some winners managing some winners uh managing our Capital usage getting rid of of risk and uh freeing up some Capital to hopefully get into new opportuni sometimes next week so uh hope you got in some of those uh good little trades and uh we'll see if this can continue if you want to catch these trades live tune in to Johnny trades every Wednesday",
