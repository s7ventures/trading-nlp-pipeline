  "how wide should iron Condors be how wide Tony Batista about this wide not this wide got fit in between there um so how watch Iron Iron our iron Condors be and the answer we're going to find out let's do it iron Condors are one of the most popular strategies for new Traders and smaller count sizes however one question many people have is how wide should they be because the regular iron Condors you know the risk rewards are tough but we got to make something happen here so how do you make",
  "to make something happen here so how do you make something happen with iron condos well in today's segment we're going to explore the optimal width for different underlyings and by adjusting the wiek span of iron Condors Traders can optimize their risk reward balance and improve profitability smaller Wings might not receive enough credit while larger Wings may be too expensive to trade with a lower return on Capital we looked at five underlyings of different prices $100 stock $200 stock 300 400",
  "of different prices $100 stock $200 stock 300 400 a $500 stock all with similar IVs okay so we do the q's Microsoft Visa which we don't look at very often iwm and xbi and again we did this because we wanted to cover each price range okay MH we calculated the average p&l the return on Capital used for different wings and then all the trades were done at 45 days to expiration and um 16 Delta short strikes manag at 21 DT over 1,000 trials were recorded for 12 years of study 2013 to 2025 all right",
  "for 12 years of study 2013 to 2025 all right yep we're going we're going the whole Gauntlet with you how wide should it be so for a $500 underlying like the q's the $5 Wide Wings did not have a positive return on Capital while every other wi did it's pretty interesting because pry I would I would have thought it would even have to be wider than that on a $500 underline I would say you know the the 2030 $50 wide iron Condor would have been where you wouldd have to go this is really telling and",
  "you wouldd have to go this is really telling and you know why because there's no way I would have got any of these numbers right agreed I know I wouldn't I mean the $5 doll wide wi that's crazy to me which one of these is optimal I I don't know the answer I really don't but what I do know is no more $5 Wide Wings in the qes yeah that's true well that's right because when you talk about you know $500 uh stocks you're looking at the cu's $500 right I mean I know it's an ETF would you yeah yeah",
  "I mean I know it's an ETF would you yeah yeah all right so for a $400 wide a $400 underlying such as Microsoft the majority of the return on capitals were positive the best return on Capital was the $25 wings so again even in a $400 stock like Microsoft the $5 wide Wings we're not profitable and you look at this thing you're like well I you just can't go narrow in these iron condors and we've been saying this for a long time I don't know if we've come to the $ five conclusion like this but",
  "we've come to the $ five conclusion like this but we've been saying this for a long time tight iron condors and that's the quandry in a smaller account you know you you have to have a tight iron Condor it kind of opens you up to um well A Hard Road to profitability so here's a $300 underline and again the $5 Wide Wings no bueno mhm 10 15 20 all worked $5 no but the $20 Wings which has been the case across the board this seemed to be the best um The Proven winner across the board yeah it even it",
  "Proven winner across the board yeah it even it even goes to the zero days from our research that 20 even $30 wide iron Condor playing these zero day options uh that seems to be the best bang for your buck also from our research at least yeah let's go um let's go to the $200 and in the $200 stock the $5 Wide Wings which is iwm it didn't work either right and the the $15 wide wings were the best but basically 15 20 um which this is a huge it's kind of an indictment on like everything that",
  "kind of an indictment on like everything that everybody talks about and teaches with iron Condors you kind of got to get wide otherwise you can't do them yep yep and you gotta get listen you gotta get a wide stance in football you gotta get a wider stance in baseball you need stability s off you got to go wider that's why you're two little pin legs you like to go naked because you don't have that wide stance you can't uh you can't grip the ground got him I'm so happy you explain that to me",
  "got him I'm so happy you explain that to me you're welcome um NASDAQ up 11 Big Boy let's go to the next slide in the $100 stock the $5 Wide Wings didn't work either so there's no $5 Wide Wings anymore yeah yeah this is5 that's it $5 gone so those people who do our uh our uh rins and stuff like that don't be calling no $5 iron Condors I don't want to hear it anymore don't be calling in in this case the lower priced the $10 wide wing was the best but still yep yep so some of the takeaways here um",
  "still yep yep so some of the takeaways here um and this is kind of super interesting so the results from the study show that in order to achieve a larger return on used capital and average p&l for higher price underlying you need to widen your strikes the amount by which the average penl goes up per $5 change in width decreases after the wing width sweet spot is hit for that underline however if the underly is low priced may be difficult to be consistent using the wider Wing Iron Condors due to",
  "using the wider Wing Iron Condors due to the buying power and less return on Capital so for smaller accounts stick to the narrow wings like $10 wide for a general guideline iron Condors iron Condor Wings should be between 10 and 30 increasing in $5 increments for every $100 increase in price that's pretty good that is that is pretty good however you may adjust those for your own risk reward strategies as long as the potential return on Capital and pnl remain in check so basically what the",
  "and pnl remain in check so basically what the research team did because we've never done this before is they've essentially said okay so for every $100 in price raise so $100 stock go $10 wide $200 stock go 15 a $300 stock go 20 a $400 stock Go 25 and a $500 stock go 30 yeah I got it makes sense and we we we we've discussed similar plays like that you know expanding more like um no we never made it that mechanical no we me $300 stocks $30 wide we didn't do it quite as well quite a good job $2",
  "we didn't do it quite as well quite a good job $2 stock $20 wide $400 stock $40 wide kind of making stocks out of um Iron Condor is out of play for smaller stocks on the larger stocks I like the way they've done here by going up by $5 incr uh increments it works out nicely even the S&P is up 20 NASDAQ up 13 Russell up 24 the Dow up 260 volatility in by 54 cents um side I got an email here that square is now XYZ uh already so we can't say hey you trade stock XYZ anymore because now there is a",
  "trade stock XYZ anymore because now there is a stock XYZ do you believe it kind of interesting that they did that"
