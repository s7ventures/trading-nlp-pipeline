what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video we are going to cover an iron [Music] Condor all right so Nvidia has earnings coming up after the close today one of the biggest stocks biggest names in the market right now it is basically at highs here at 145 just couple dollars off the all-time highs here I currently don't have a position on in it and I think it's a perfect trade for an earnings V crush a little bit of sideways action um it seems like kind of the speculation is is Big Move in either direction I'm going to play for kind of a nothing burger here so I'm actually going to go to December and get a little bit less uh binary kind of profit or loss here going to December versus the two-day weekly is going to be obviously a less instant pain or instant gain type trade um but will give me some more management options in the future because it's not going to move as much and because volatility is super high here you got a 61% implied volatility in the back of about mid-50s you can expect to see 6 to 10 points of V contraction come out of this trade into the end of the week so there's still a very sizable V contraction here um so I'm going to go to December I'm going to do just about the 20 Deltas on either side and uh go $10 wide on an iron Condor a pretty standard entry point I'm going to do the the 130 strike on the downside go to the 120 uh to define the risk I'm going to the 22 Delta just like that round number of 130 on the upside let's seean a little bit short here we'll go to the 165 and buy the 175 strikes so you'll see this trades at right around 1/3 the width of the strikes $325 26 you got $600 in Risk we can look at the curve view which will give us an idea of just how our risk profile will look like here this is from uh analyzing uh through the end of the week here we can move this uh through through the end of the month here kind of what our profit potential is this is is without any sort of V contraction if we move V couple points you could see our our profit or loss widens out here as well if we look at at expiration so this is b a binary look this is a look of the profit or loss on December 20th middle of December here uh we've got a break even point you know 125 is and 135 is on the up or 165 is on the upside so big wide range to hit here if we get an on movement I expect this trade to come in1 $150 probably would be my guess if we get somewhere inside the expected move which is currently through the end of the week $11 so if you get a $5 $6 move in either direction I think this will be a home run an8 to $10 move you're probably making 50 60 70 cents anything greater than that is probably a marked loss or maybe a scratch depending on how much volatility comes out so um we're going to go ahead and Route this order let's see if we can get a little bit above the uh mid price here and you can see markets are moving move in all right so we got filled there on the iron Condor 36 we got price improved by a penny there on the fill which is nice to see you got love the high frequency trading there um you're going to want to stick around though because we are going to be managing this position for for sure into earning so stick around and see what happens with this position all right so we've got a closing order for our Nvidia earnings trade if you remember we were looking at Nvidia we did an iron condor in the December monthly expiration and the key that we were looking at was volatility right so we were looking to play an inside move which we very much had an inside move I think it was about a a a $12 expected move or so uh when we were looking at this yesterday um we can actually pull up the expected move just to look at the change from these two options the aam money options we closed right around here at 45 so these moved about $7 and they're marked $4 and change so right around $12 was the expected move yesterday I'm just doing that based on the straddle price yesterday through the end of the week it was trading at $12 yesterday which means that that was roughly the expected move through the end of the week it's now trading at $4 so if you sold that stradle definitely made a lot of money there anyways we were talking about volatility the big thing that we were looking at was this monthly implied volatility moving in line with the back months so you can see the back months are now at 47 we got December at 47 when we place this trade yesterday if we go to The View Market snapshots volatility was right around 60% that's the IV index which is wrapped around 30day implied volatility it's a Vic style implied volatility so we had about a 60% implied volatility that has come in to a 47% implied volatility so we got 13 or 14 points of V out of this trade after earnings and the company of a non-movement in the in the stock so this position uh was a home run it was perfect for what happened here we're going to go ahead and take the money and run on this trade which uh worked out perfectly for us so we're looking at a 217 or 216 debit depending on where we get filled here which will put us right wrapped around a $100 profit overnight it was a nice little trade here let's try and get 26 make it an even $100 profit here no fill there move this up to 217 pH let's go 218 markets are moving we've had some volatility this morning in terms of price action volatility Futures have been whipping around as well all right so we're out it took us to a couple pennies up to get out of that trade at$ 21997 profit overnight on that trade again we could look at the um uh IV index we sold 60% implied volatility bought it back at 47.5% implied volatility it's exactly what you play for the underlying price basically unchanged I know this looks like a little bit more than it is this is just about a dollar in price change when we look at Ivy rank going from 45 Ivy rank pre- earnings down to 25 so volatility is relatively low there you can see we started with basically zero Delta today we had about zero Delta our Theta decay of course we had $7 and change in Theta Decay that is uh now the same $7 or so but has come out significantly in in the extrinsic value so great win a really good example of implied volatility and how much volatility comes in after an earnings report
