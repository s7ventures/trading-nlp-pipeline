  "this is our Market measure sponsored by sibo it's Dr Jim in the house for his first Market measure let's see if he can figure this out first Slide John in our studio in our studies we've discussed how our view of the market efficien our view of market efficiency is somewhere between semi strong and the strong version of efficient market hypothesis would you say you're in that camp Mr Schultz uh well this is a maybe a longer thing not necessarily okay I'm in that camp for sure um Jim is a guest",
  "okay I'm in that camp for sure um Jim is a guest host today this is why we don't have guest hosts usually but Tom Tony and the research team are in the semi strong to strong version of efficient market hypothesis Well normally when again normally when you say we you know it's all of y'all and then it's me right so now I'm just going to voluntarily put myself outside of that I think the emotional reaction of the market in the search for equilibrium in the short term is more power ful than the",
  "in the short term is more power ful than the models give credit for I'll just say that in other words risk in return for a particular trade cannot be manipulated only understood and managed accordingly so let's test this Theory with two popular ETFs that are both very Diversified but they have different underlying prices implied volatilities and components we're going to look at the Spy n iwm now just for the record I will tell you that right now I happen to be short spy and long iwm not",
  "now I happen to be short spy and long iwm not because we were doing a study here today I've had this position on for it's been a while two and a half months yeah yeah it's been a while today it's working okay by conducting the same trade on each over a long period of time what does our average p&l and short-term risk profile B of pnl look like for each and is there a risk return advantage of trading one over the other I'm going to ask you this because the first question it's not fair the second",
  "the first question it's not fair the second question I mean not fair to ask second question is do you think cuz Jim has not seen this yet I haven't do you think there is a risk return advantage of trading the S smps over iwm so if I so if I had to guess I'm going to assume having not seen this that iwm could potentially give you greater returns but uh spy is going to give you lower risk so again it's game is and gotas you pick your poison as you like to say and I so that's what I think you're",
  "like to say and I so that's what I think you're going to be up against I'd be I'd be surprised if the results suggest anything other than that I've been surprised before you'd be surprised if the results suggest anything other than lower risk with spy higher returns with iwm okay that's fair um not necessarily the Holy Grail of both with one I'm going to say that the risk return advantage of trading one over another is going to be virtually nil so that so you're saying it's know when you factor",
  "that so you're saying it's know when you factor in both risk and return Yes okay I I agree with you but I think depending on how the guys and gals like sliced up the data it'll be Cur I'm curious to see if they actually kind of pinpoint the return aspect and the risk aspect okay because that's the question here 2013 to present 12 years worth of data 16 Delta strangles in both three lots in iwm on average the spies around three times the price of iwm okay one lot in the Spy 45 days in both",
  "of iwm okay one lot in the Spy 45 days in both managed 21 days we recorded the win rate the average P the volatility panl and the return on investment all right let's go to next slide and let's take a look and see where we are first the win rate between the two is nearly identical I don't think that I don't think that any of us would be that that that that's surprising to any of us I think that whatever you do regardless of implied volatility regardless of everything else the win rate is going",
  "of everything else the win rate is going to be virtually the same we need people to understand that that that's how this works the win rate's always going to be the same nearly identical this suggest that the Deltas are priced efficiently across these products even though the components are completely different yeah agreed I would absolutely expect that I would be shocked if it was ever anything other than that I agree with you let's go next Slide the key takeaway however is that the risk is",
  "the key takeaway however is that the risk is that the ratio of risk reward for these strategies is astonishingly close with 36% more expected risk and return for iwm that's Jim said and the actual historical risk I'm sorry the the actual historical risk and the return numbers fell in line almost perfectly which is what you said yes which is really interesting well we've been doing this for a long time so what's so funny about this is the average implied volatility you can see the iwm is always",
  "implied volatility you can see the iwm is always going to be higher but we we did a ratio here ratio of iwm to to spy was you know 1.33 and you can see right here the average P the strangles was greater um for iws the volatility of the p&l was also greater because you make more money you have more volatility and the return on investments is a little bit higher but the ratios are all virtually stay the same let's go to next slide so okay well yeah let let's let's see what the we can go back one",
  "let let's let's see what the we can go back one go back one no I was just well I I was curious how you take this information and use it so H how is this how is this information I'll tell you exactly I'll tell you exactly how I do it I take this information because I recognize that my decision over what to trade this has nothing to do with like the pairs trade on that I have but if I was going to do a strangle my decision to put the position on would be based on implied volatility rank not based",
  "be based on implied volatility rank not based on whether or not I like spy I like Dow I like Q's or I like iwm my decision is based on where's the greatest opportunity because the pop is going to be the same no matter which one I choose and that is the beautiful thing about being product indifferent and having so many different opportunities right yes because it doesn't matter you're right when you're looking at strikes you're looking at Deltas you're looking at probabilities spy iwm you know",
  "you're looking at probabilities spy iwm you know coinbase whatever that is going to be kind of uniform across the board and it's a beautiful thing that is 100% correct um let's go to the takeaways risk and reward are priced extremely efficiently over time in liquid and diversified under lines even if the components are completely different that's why we focus on implied volatility comparing implied volatilities across different products can be used as a proxy for comparing the two products risk",
  "as a proxy for comparing the two products risk and return characteristics over the long term in this study we showed how the higher implied volatility underlyings the higher implied volatility you got historically the higher the p&l but also equiv equivocally equivalently higher risk sorry equivalently equivalently best aren't you glad I'm here equivalent aren't you glad I'm here S&P has just rallied 50 handles I mean that's a that was impressive nasdaq's now only down 270 yes well so I wonder",
  "nasdaq's now only down 270 yes well so I wonder if well no the the the Trump tariff meetings aren't until later right well obviously started started now I just wonder if there's been some news they hit the wire well they were just down 115 and now they're down 70 so I would say that"
