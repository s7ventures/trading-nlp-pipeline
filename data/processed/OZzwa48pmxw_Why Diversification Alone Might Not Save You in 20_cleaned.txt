the probability of compounding losses and IV correlation on the first slide here we're just going to show the snps in green and then we're just showing some other you know we're giving you TLT and gold and just showing you kind of like you know how things are all over the place no no Rhyme or Reason so here's where we start to get into kind of the the the guts of this discussion today and the purpose of the discussion is really to show you kind of how important it is is to stay and how important it is to stay where you're not where you don't have all your eggs in the same basket because things tend to move together especially in down moves yep so now we never have down moves so that confuses everybody because we only go up but someday we might not just go up and if that happens that's why this is good research so on average prices for for snps gold and bonds have a fairly low positive correlation or they have a moderate inverse correlation like bonds and stocks are moderate inverse correlation gold and stocks have a moderate positive correlation none of those are statistically significant you know negative .29 or Z or6 those are not those are aren't anything that's with price with implied volatility they're moderately correlated meaning more so than the more so than price right because Gold Bond snps you know they have a higher correlation than price right and um because fear is not something you know fear doesn't really know so so so so that's the first takeaway let's go next slide and this is the last like eight years so the next thing we look at is the trend becomes even more prominent during unexpected Market turbulence such as February of a c February March of a couple years ago so we went back and we looked at Price back in 2020 during the pandemic and the gold price and the TLT price were still you know there was virtually no correlation but the implied volatility was much higher and so meaning that fear in snps and fear in bonds and fear in gold was all close to they were all close to the same what we're going to do is we're going to use that information to dive further into this by looking how it how how lucky it is or How likely it is for spy strangles and TLT strangles to incur large losses simultaneously what happens when things get ugly so we looked at bonds and we looked at S&P and we looked at 13 years we did the typical 16 Delta strangle 45 days to expiration manag 21 days and we calculated How likely it was for each strategy to have a loss more than um half one half X 1X 2x or 3x of the initial credit so the initial credit let's say was $5 one half would be you know 250 one would be 250 50 I'm sorry one would be $5 and two would be $10 on top of the original five yep so so that means like if we sold something at five we buy back at $750 $10 or you know 2x would be 20 given that the Spy strangle losses um were more we calculate the probability that TLT losses would have would also be more for each of the losses listed above let's take a look the probability of a loss worse then so again this is where it gets kind of really interesting TLT strangles tend to reach two to three times losses more often than spy strangles since their initial credit tends to be lower however overall it's fairly rare for spy and ttlt losses there strangles to incur losses particularly large ones so for example spy strangles and TLT strangles have lost more than 2x the initial credit 6 and 9% of the time respectively which is quite small what we showed here is the probability of a loss worse you know worse than one half one half the time one half the credit or one time the credit is something that is I don't know fairly manageable sure sure fairly manageable for sure I mean if you're winning a high percentage of the time and losing you know you sell something for $5 you have to buy it back for $10 it's and it's only10 or 133% of the time it's not that bad or at least I wouldn't think it's that bad however the conditional probability of a loss of a 2X loss is much higher let's see what that means given that the Spy strangle incurred a loss worse than two times initial loss the Spy strangle also had a loss worse than 2x nearly 30% of the time so what they're saying is that that together H that was not not that good so not ideal no I wouldn't say that was ideal Additionally the more severe the loss of the Spy strangle the more likely it was for the TLT strangle to have a similar large loss by expiration so the probability of a TLT strangle loss worse than a worse than the the original loss given the Spy loss was worse than the original loss um projection was actually a little higher than we thought it was almost it was 27% just under 30% so as an individual stock it was like 133% but together was like 27% okay that's that's kind of high all right let's see where they're going with this I think they're I think the takeaway is that that you need to stay small in order to protect yourself but let's see let's go next slide so this trend is due to the fact that both these underlyings tend to become more volatile when the um when Market volatility is higher as a result simultaneous large losses are more likely when the market becomes more volatile this is why position size management is so important I think that's a good point so on the takeaway slide what what the team is saying is that implied voles across different underlyings show stronger positive correlations than their prices especially during Market sell-offs highlighting the limits of diversification in protecting short option portfolio from broad volatility spikes so diversification alone cannot Shield against market-wide volatility expansions that affect multiple positions simultaneously that's why there's sometimes you just look at your positions you're like oh crap you know there's like kind of nothing everything everything seems to move in tandem anyway now it might move to a little lesser degree something might be up 1% something might only be up a quarter percent I mean it's very hard to find yeah that that unicorn of a of a you know uncorrelated portfolio so in a study while large losses on spy and TLT were rare a significant loss in spy often coincided with a similar loss in TLT even though they weren't correlated right particularly though as Market volatility increased again and here's the biggest takeaway to this underscoring the need for careful position sizing I have heard so many people tell I've listen to so many different people that don't understand how markets work talk about listen as long as your divers I ified you're fine as long as you're this or that as long as you put in a stop order as long as you do this or that you're fine the reality is that is not the case the way to defend yourself keep your positions small that's it yeah Piggyback in that confirm and send about crypto and everything else like that it really does come down to sizing that's it anytime I've ever got in trouble it's always been too big never too small anyway that's it yep good
