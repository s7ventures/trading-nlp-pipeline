we decided to do a four four-part series on earnings every Monday this is part two regarding around earnings and we're we're spreading it off in case it's like an IRA account or in case you have limited capital or making it into an iron Condor so obviously if you do an iron Condor you're going to have a results that are slightly slightly less than if you did a strangle because strangle more risk more reward um strangle more risk higher probability of success so if we spread everything off it's going to be a little bit less risk so the the odds go down a little bit but still I think there's a positive return so let's take a look let's do it and like I said get your helmet on for this one during earnings announcements Traders employee strategies like undefined risk strangles and defin risk like iron Condors to leverage in to leverage increased volatility each strategy presents a different risk reward profile and so let's take a look the efficient market hypothesis says that asset prices reflect all available information including earnings data thus a key question how do earnings and an MS influence a portfolios risk reward Dynamics across various strategies defined and undefined how can Traders optimize these strategies in an efficient market let's take a look six years same as we did last time Apple Netflix Amazon and Tesla 16 Delta strangle and a 16 Delta strangle and a 1016 Delta iron Condor so means in both we sold the same option we just bought a 10 Delta in the iron Condor we calcul calulated the average p&l the premium the buying power the return on Capital compared the results let's see what we got and there's a lot of stuff here I promise you this was the deploying the strangle um without anything else if you remember this is from last week this is just in six years looking at four different stocks how does this 16 Delta strangle work works pretty good you know 70 78% chance of success how does it work with the ratio of average p over buying power not bad 02028 how about premium collected how about return on investment and the return on investment it's again this is over a six-year period um for each each individual you know each individual trade it's okay um Tesla was actually a loser the other ones were small winners across the board earnings trades remember have the smallest amount of edge so just keep that in mind let's go to next slide so now what we're going to do is we're going to take a look and we're going to look at just solely at earnings using a strangle not not defined risk but using undefined risk we went this is stuff we did last week too we just looked at a strangle and the win rates all stayed High the ratio stayed High the premium collector was decent and the return on investment worked in apple but didn't work in Netflix Amazon and Tesla and those numbers were net negative numbers if you just did the strangle just on earnings so the results are very mixed burnings even with even with a 72 or 73% probability of profit the result are mixed let's go to next slide so for a strangle the return on investment is potentially high but that's when you're timing is optimal but the risk of large moves um the non- earnings periods were steady but a little bit lower than you know than than the earnings periods with less dramatic price action so here we summarized everything for you in the other columns but let's go to the next slide so here we go to an iron Condor and this is taking a little bit of risk off the table but we need to see how these came out um in in all these different periods for these particular stocks now remember this is a six-year this was a six-year like very strong bull market and these are very strong NASDAQ stocks Apple Netflix Amazon and Tesla the win rates were fine the ratio of p&l over buying power that's not so good that number came out negative the premium collected was obviously positive and the return on investment in these cases was negative now again we were in a very strong bull market and you did not get paid even with a high win rate the losses wiped it out let's go to next slide so here we present the results solely on earnings data which is a little different than all the data combined now the earnings data the return on investments actually were except for Apple so for Netflix Amazon and Tesla it's actually a little bit worse for Apple it's positive the the the win rate dropped a lot the ratio of average p&l um over buying power this time it turned positive which before it was negative much that's due to Apple but also Tesla and Amazon were positive and the premium collected was all obviously positive um and the return on investment that's the scary thing it was good in apple but it was negative in the other ones so this is a very mixed bag of tricks when I say I don't love earnings trades bat there's a reason for me when I say that and I think you're looking at the reason like oh we just got filled at bonds got filled buying bonds at four I don't love that um but Netflix Amazon and Tesla over the last 8 years had a negative return for earnings and that's why it's tough to play those for earnings trades and apple it's tough I totally agree I've been very selective trading earnings if if at all uh when they come out I've been doing well with post earnings trades uh but earnings Trad themselves un let volatility is extremely high and it's very liquid I try to avoid it well looks like Netflix sold off a little bit post earnings today after being up initially oh oh the other stock I was trying to think of this morning was Taiwan semiconductor they had earnings and they they out kicked their coverage too yes so the earnings have not been that great this cycle at all let's go to the next slide so here's where we summarize the iron Condor and I'm not going to read through all of this but their return on investment is potentially High minus 9% to plus 9% if the timing is optional but there's the risk of large moves of course and in non-earning periods it's a little steadier but again a little bit lower with um very with less dramatic price action let's go to next slide so and these are very subjective too a strangle can outperform an iron Condor around earnings due to its greater benefit from implied volatility crush and a wider profit range however strangle carries more risk the stock moves significantly while iron Condor has defined risk it's a balance between higher potential profit and greater protection you know um these numbers are are rough and when we broke it down on the top on the biggest five stocks like here you can see this has been a challenge in the last eight years with tech stocks specifically Netflix um we picked the really tough ones you know Netflix and Google um Apple's been good as it gets a little more mature it gets a little easier so Apple's been good but net Netflix and and Amazon those are tough they've been tough um avoid large moves by focusing on stocks where you don't expect massive shifts High implied volatility often signals potential volatility so check historical earnings reactions you know this stuff's all very much common sense but the key here is key position size is small to manage the prizes that can they can move the market unpredictably during earnings yeah I just be careful I mean you know sometimes earnings are very attractive somebody wrote me this morning and said hey I'm just going to buy a bunch of Premium before the earnings and I'll sell it I mean to buy it two weeks before and sell it out a week you know a week or three days ority expands keeps up with as it expands and I'm like they're like how does that sounds a strategy I'm like well it works sometimes it doesn't work other times it's about a 50/50 crapshoot earnings are very much a crapshoot very much I think that I think they're almost a directional play if anything at all yeah uh for for them yeah no I totally agree um and you know we have triy to avoid in earnings um stocks that aren't going to have large moves by maybe you know avoiding Pharmaceuticals avoid something that doesn't have you know tight liquid markets doing something with defined risk if markets are a little bit wider so you know there are ways to mitigate the risk without avoiding them altoe but for me earnings earnings are just an event that passes in a day and you know business is usual the next day that's the way I like to look at
