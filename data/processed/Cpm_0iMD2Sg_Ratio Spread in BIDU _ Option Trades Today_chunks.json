  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today uh September 26 2024 but first as I always do let's take a quick look at the market and see what's going on because it's been quite a market &ps are up 13 you might think that's a lot but if you look &ps were 5830 they were almost 40 handles higher they were up over 50 handles this morning uh they are now only up 14 the NASDAQ has had a 300 Point uh move in the market already this morning but it's still up",
  "the market already this morning but it's still up 58 or 57 Russell up 18 and the Dow of 2011 a lot of this is due to Chinese stocks to the upside and smci to the downside smci a little report came out they might be cooking the books at smci I have no idea the first thing I want to do is take a look at smci I noticed it had earnings November 6th which is before the November expiration so I was already not uh that Keen on trading smci and then I looked at the markets the markets are quite wide so",
  "at the markets the markets are quite wide so I said you know what I'm not trading uh smci today at all so I went back to my high option volume list I clicked on the earnings so that I could have the earnings out of the way or at least look at the stocks with high option volume that have earnings after expiration expiration uh being the 50 you notice something here JD Chinese stock High Ivy rank up almost 4% in the last 5 days Ivy rank of 47 paloalto network doing the same although today's um",
  "network doing the same although today's um volatility is down uh I don't know what XP is uh so well they interested in trading that but a name popped up here Buu look at this up almost 2% over the last 5 days and it's got an ivy rank of 58 higher than JD and plus J a $37 stock makes a little bit harder um to sell premium in a smaller price stock all things being equal the premiums are smaller even though if they're higher relative to that stock big change there $410 in JD big change in bu but",
  "big change there $410 in JD big change in bu but Buu well off of its highs too look at this Buu up almost $4 higher than where it is right now sometimes you can't always catch everything uh at the top and the bottoms the low is right about where it's trading right now as the Market is kind of making lows now I'm going to get a little bit well you might suggest that I might want to trade higher in bu but I'm going to trade a little bit lower or look for a little bit of selloff in bu do let me",
  "look for a little bit of selloff in bu do let me show you what I'm going to do before I do that you'll notice that earnings of the 19th that's after expiration let's take a look at that right here on the option chain you'll see this Big E which means earnings you'll see this purple line is after expiration it also has the date here November 19th you'll see the these options are November 15 50 days to go 45 being optimal taking trades off around 21 all things being optimal uh you'll be looking",
  "21 all things being optimal uh you'll be looking to any position you put on in October You' be looking to move from October to November today tomorrow yesterday the day before Monday of next week Tuesday of next week but it's that time frame when you should be looking to roll positions so you definitely at least I am opening all my positions in November so what am I going to look to do here in buou first thing I look at markets are good not great matter of fact some of these out of the money",
  "matter of fact some of these out of the money options are quite wide 87114 a 10 cents wide here got a good Mark in the 20s here look at these puts out of the money puts 20 cents wide here so be careful with your pricing when you put anything in uh especially if you're looking to sell or even if you're looking to buy but if you're looking to sell if I was looking to to sell these puts whether theyd be naked or to spread I would be going well over the the $193 mid price I would be going you know",
  "the the $193 mid price I would be going you know a197 $198 and then walk it down watch the stock uh if the stock starts up ticking maybe be a little bit more aggressive uh with my pricing a little bit lower because again this would be a long Delta position if stock is going higher that means it's going the opposite direction from where I need to get filled if it starts to go lower maybe I keep my price where it is only move at one penny or two pennies again I'm just trying to show you how to um",
  "again I'm just trying to show you how to um uh play the market as you're watching the market to see what's going on all right what am I looking to do I'm going to look to do a ratio spread here a call ratio spread now the call ratio spread before I put it up here is going to have no risk to the downside and for that reason alone if it has no risk to one side that has to be a bearish position if it has no risk to the downside if it has no risk to the upside I would call a bullish position if you",
  "the upside I would call a bullish position if you can't lose money in One Direction then that's the direction it has to be but ratio spreads are quite unique where they have a big tent or a big sweet spot right where your short strike is which is actually in the opposite direction that you want the stock to go to let me explain I like to buy the option that's around that 30ish uh probability of success you see here with $5 wide strikes not dollar wide strikes meaning there's no 106 107 108",
  "wide strikes meaning there's no 106 107 108 makes it a little bit more difficult I'm going at default to the 110 calls I'm going to buy the 110 calls and look at these markets a nice and tight now I'm going to sell the 120 calls now I'm trying to go $10 wide on here typically I would do a 1 by two spread great probability of profit 87% um is a little bit of short Delta 16 short Deltas I want to be short uh bu you'll notice here this green line gives you you that uh probability of success where",
  "you you that uh probability of success where you make money there's no risk to the downside your upside risk is a little bit above 120 let me explain why cuz I've bought one of the 110 calls and I sold two of the 215 calls I'm long the 110 115 call spread one time I know there's two of those give me a minute I'm long that one time if I just had that spread on one time that spread could be worth $5 which bring brings my break even to one 12 but I'm short one extra 115 call so I have to account",
  "I'm short one extra 115 call so I have to account for that which gives me risk above 120 actually 121 uh approximately 121 to the upside now my best case scenario at expiration 50 days from now is a stock is at 115 and I make $500 plus the credit I received that's why my Max profit 638 but that's not the trade I'm doing I'm going to try to take on a little well I don't know if you're going to want to consider it a little bit more risk or a little bit less risk but you tell me I think contracts",
  "bit less risk but you tell me I think contracts equal risk so I'm going to say it's a little bit more risky even though I can make more money on this trade instead of being one by two I'm going to go to one by3 on this spread one by three on this spread meaning I'm buying one of the 110 calls I'm selling three three of the 120 calls and I'm using $4,200 in buying power you notice what I did the 1 by two it was significantly less buying power I'll give it to you again even if you were looking to",
  "give it to you again even if you were looking to do this trade one by two you'd be using $2,200 in buying power this is a small debit I like to do it for a credit I like my credit to be over a dollar cuz all things being equal if I get the move I want this spread is going to collapse quite nicely and I can maybe make myself a buck or two on this overall spread using $4,200 I'm going one by two uh 1 by3 my break even on this spread is going to be a little bit different than a 1 by two let me",
  "be a little bit different than a 1 by two let me explain to you I'm long one of the 110 calls work with me here for a second just like we did a moment ago and I'm short only one of the 120 calls that spread would be worth $10 at expiration if the stock was sitting right at 120 now since I had two extra calls remember cuz I'm 1 by3 but I have that $10 that I could make I have a Max profit of $173 because that's about where it's trading right now now you can do this spread better than I put it on",
  "you can do this spread better than I put it on I put it on at a156 and a $1.70 that was when the stock was only up around $6 $66.50 I'll show you that um in the uh follow page in just one second now at expiration if it goes right to 120 I make my $1,000 I don't anticipate the stock going here because I have short Delta but if it did I got a 91% pop my break even would be 125 cuz I have two extra 120 calls and I have a $1,000 on this Max profit on this call spread I have so that means on those",
  "on this call spread I have so that means on those two calls would be $5 a piece my break even is approximately $125 with the stock trading $101 and change and only a $10 expected move that $10 expected move comes into play here because that's right where my long strike is all things being equal if it has a expected move over the next 50 days that the option pricing is putting in that brings us right to 110 111 these 120 calls will be worth nothing these 110 calls will be right at the money",
  "these 110 calls will be right at the money they'll have the most premium in them those will be the ones I'm long and everybody uh is happy now what do I really want to happen tomorrow this stock opens down $7 and this spread instead of being a$1 70ish and change in credit would probably be um zero or maybe a small debit and I could take this trade off for a nice buck buck 50 profit overall in Buu now remember something Buu uh if a stock can move almost 10% today off of its highs remember was",
  "almost 10% today off of its highs remember was significantly higher 104 uh today so that's over a 10% move nothing is guaranteed here but I like the probability of success 91% seems good to me positive Theta $85 for the risk that I'm taking so if that volatility contracts that we saw over the last 5 days instead of it being higher actually goes lower and maybe the stock even goes lower the stock doesn't move but volatility comes in we don't have to worry about earnings these out of the money",
  "to worry about earnings these out of the money options should lose more premium faster than my at the money option would be 23 short Deltas means you definitely want the stock to go lower Max profit of $1,173 depending on where you sell it at right now it's 167 you can see here the markets get a little bit wider they get a little bit tighter um I would Suspect with the stock right here up to $740 you'd be able to get filled at 175 174 173 or 172 if you're watching this now listen if you had",
  "172 if you're watching this now listen if you had watched this earlier today um or you have a tasty trade account you'll always see me right on the follow page I'm Bob the trader you click on this you'll see 6 minutes later I sold it at a156 um with the stock trading uh just under 101 and with the stock trading just over 101 I was able to sell it at $1.70 so this is a trade that will have movement to it if the stock goes in the opposite direction obviously you'll be able to collect more credit",
  "obviously you'll be able to collect more credit and if it goes lower we'll be able to buy it back for a profit you'll notice here that I always put in a description it's a rare 1x3 I say rare 1x3 because I'm using more buying power um and I like to do these typically at 1 by2 it's a call ratio spread with no risk to the downside you'll notice 6 minutes later all I Ed was another trunch here's where we get in trouble remember size kills so keep your positions small if 1x3 is too um uh too much",
  "your positions small if 1x3 is too um uh too much buying power for you or too many units for you and you should stay away from this type of trade I like it because it's a little bit wider I've got a lot of money sitting on the sidelines my last three two or three trades that I've made on this podcast have all been um uh uh iron Condors with defined risk Buu does not have defined risk I've been saving my uh my my powder saving my buying power for trades that take out a little bit more risk and a",
