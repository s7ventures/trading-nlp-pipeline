so I've been trading a smaller account but I'm about to come into some money how would you suggest I scale up slowly would be my easiest way if you're doing Define risk trades that are $3 to5 wide maybe you might want to go to5 to $10 wide more of a synthetic strangle maybe even $10 to $20 wide on an iron Condor or one side by selling naked puts or naked calls when you're trading a smaller account and you're ramping up to a larger account the most important thing to do at first is to prove concept the way you prove concept is I mean essentially you start small you start your scaling up process small like Tony said by widening the strikes rather than adding more contracts you add more risk and then you prove that you can handle the additional risk and then you continue to scale up by widen the strikes and then eventually you add more contracts
