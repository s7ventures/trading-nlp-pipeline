  "probability of touching on the call side is generally higher than on the put side due to the market's upward trend in recent years. This study may be skewed by current market conditions.",
  "The probability of a touch indicates the chance that an options price will reach its strike price before it expires. It is useful for premium sellers focusing on price movements as it gives an indication of the statistical chances of being challenged.",
  "know about this before? It's important to consider the probability of an option finishing in the money versus the probability of it touching. This knowledge can greatly impact trading decisions.",
  "We discovered that the probability of profit often overstates the realized success rate, as does the theoretical probability of a touch. This was unknown to Floor Traders. We found this out by analyzing a 45-day 10 Delta.",
  "We analyzed 45-day 10 Delta puts and calls for SPY, QQQ, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT. All positions were held to expiration. The probability of a touch on these 10 Delta options is roughly 20%. The actual probability of touch for these puts is lower than expected due to the upward trend.",
  "Theoretical probability of touching 10 Delta puts should be 20%, but in reality, it only happened 9% of the time over a 10-year period. This supports the argument for selling puts.",
  "The probability of calls being breached is higher than puts due to the strong bull market in recent years. The average actual probability of calls being breached is around 19%. SPY and QQQ were the biggest at 25%, followed by Apple and Amazon.",
  "top three stocks, with an average win rate of 65% for puts and 70% for calls. This data suggests that selling calls may be slightly more profitable than selling puts in this context.",
  "The win rates on the put side are significantly higher by 21% compared to the call side due to the strong market and quick rebounds from market bottoms. The success rate for 10 Delta puts averaged around 60% at expiration, except for Apple which was lower on the call side.",
  "Calls have a higher probability of touch than puts. Trust me on this.",
  "The probability of touch on the put side is roughly half of the theoretical probability, while on the call side it aligns with the theoretical number. The win rates after testing positions are higher on the put side than the call side, indicating that puts have performed better than calls in the last decade. However, market conditions can always change."
