  "probability of a touch puts in calls now as you can probably guess probability of a touch just means it's like it's like two times Delta or two times probability of expiring but as you can probably guess probability of touching on the call side is much better than the probability of touching on the put side because the market just has always been going up for the last 15 years so this study is going to be a little bit skewed based on all the stuff that's been happening but let's see so the",
  "stuff that's been happening but let's see so the probability of a touch indicates the chance that an options price will reach its strike price before it expires that means just touch it's useful for premium sellers focusing on price movements because what it does is it gives you an indication of what the statistical chances you're going to be challenged it doesn't mean you're going to lose money just means you're going to be challenged it's generally about twice the probability of the option",
  "about twice the probability of the option being in the money so if there's a 20% of a chance of an option finishing in the money there's a 40% chance of it touching I wish I knew this when I was a Floor Trader because I didn't learn this until Tom Preston taught it to me about 25 years ago and I never even knew there was such a thing is probability of a touch when I finally discovered it on the the first time like like literally 24 years ago we were building Theron he I said how come I never",
  "were building Theron he I said how come I never knew about this before and he looks at me and he goes and he just shook his head like you pedestrian youal yeah you neanderthal you knuckle dragger you know like who doesn't know this and I swear no Floor Trader ever knew this I wish I had known this we've known that probability of profit often overstates the realized success rate is the theoretical pot or probability of a touch similarly overstated so to find this out we analyze 45 day 10 Delta",
  "so to find this out we analyze 45 day 10 Delta puts and 10 Delta calls from the following underlines spy Q's Apple Amazon Microsoft all positions were held to expiration the probability of a touch on these 10 Delta options should be roughly 20% I mean why did we pick 10 Delta well we could have picked any Delta we just started off with 10 there's no reason we found that the actual probability of touch for these puts is much lower than expected of course because all we do is go up it's only half",
  "course because all we do is go up it's only half of the theoretical probability of touch 10 Delta puts the probability of a touch should have been 20% of the time it happened it really only happened 9% of the time in these stocks you know over a 10year period that's pretty good yes yes obviously this is the whole argument for puts or Schmutz and all you should ever do is sell puts there's your argument right there it's so easy never even went over 9% should be 20% but there a big but but but",
  "over 9% should be 20% but there a big but but but but um the actual probability touched on the call side with the same Delta that was much higher almost double what we observed on the put side the strong bull market in recent years is the primary reason making calls more likely to be breached than puts however the average actual pot is still consistent with the theoretical number suggested so this came out to about 19% touched and as you can see here spies Q's were the biggest 25% Apple Amazon",
  "here spies Q's were the biggest 25% Apple Amazon and Microsoft nothing got blown out of the water over 10 years but this is a very interesting study because you know the average was 19% supposed to be 20 it's pretty damn close the numbers work out yeah making a strong argument for selling puts and calls of course but so lastly we analyzed the win rate of these positions after the strikes were touched so on the put side the variation in win rates is slightly higher than on the call side on the",
  "is slightly higher than on the call side on the call side the rates across all underlines were very similar win rates on the put side are significantly Higher by 21% compared to the call side due to the strong market and quick rebounds from Market bottoms so the 10 Delta puts they averaged in the success rate um you know at expiration you know 60% 50% 60% pretty much across the board pretty close to 60% except for apple on the call side it was much lower no really if you looked at this you'd",
  "much lower no really if you looked at this you'd say well why should I ever sell a call exactly exactly the point that was making a moment ago that's correct but you don't always know that the Market's only going to go higher okay trust me on this is correct although might feel that way yeah I mean it it definitely does feel that way at times but it's not the way it works puts have a lower actual probability of touch than calls the actual probability of touch on the put side is roughly half of",
  "of touch on the put side is roughly half of the theoretical probability of touch whereas the actual probability of touch on the call side aligns with the theoretical number the win rates after the positions were tested is also higher on the put side than the call side meaning you know this is a master of the obvious that puts worked out better than calls in the last decade but things can change the next"
