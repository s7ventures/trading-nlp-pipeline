  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony Baptist and I have a trade idea for you November 26th 2024 but first as we always do let's take a quick look at the market even the snps are up 20 handles yeah the highs of the day you can see here they trade up to 6,028 or 6,026 right now nzc up 79 Russell down 13 and the Dow down 146 mixed bag of tricks with the Russell and the Dow lower by an equal amount that the &ps and NASDAQ are higher volatility in by 25 cents and you can see volatility getting",
  "in by 25 cents and you can see volatility getting creamed here the last three or four days good for our existing positions harder to put on new positions so let's take a look at some of those stocks that we might want to put a position on I'm going to go and save you a little bit of trouble here I'm going to show you the stock that I'm going to I'm going back into coin cuz I closed my 1 by two call ratio spread for about a dollar uh profit today when coin was a little bit lower than it is right",
  "when coin was a little bit lower than it is right now at down $6.7 but I do want to show you something here because as you can see here I've set it up as the ivx 5day change from uh the biggest change to any that might be higher today I'm going to go through this list for you and I'm going to show you these are the high option volume list there's really nothing that I like to trade that has ivx that's the five-day implied volatility change going higher um over the last 5 days you can see here",
  "higher um over the last 5 days you can see here all of these stocks here either have earnings or they're just not stocks that I like to trade you know $8 stocks $4 stocks that kind of thing so I'm going to change this now from ivx 5day change to IV rank I'm going to put it in order for you from high to low I'm going to go here and click on it twice and you'll notice that coin pops up here pretty significantly um at the high end of the range now it is down by 18% today the ivx 5day changes not",
  "it is down by 18% today the ivx 5day changes not the perfect setup for any type of trade sell premium except that the implied volatility is high so for that reason alone I'm going to take a trade in coin today now you can see how it has significantly dropped here so again it's not the perfect setup but when you look at the IV rank of around 60 it's still at the higher end of where coin typically trades and you'll notice that the stock is at the higher end too so I'm gonna put on a double ratio",
  "higher end too so I'm gonna put on a double ratio spread in coin I don't want to put on a 1 by two ratio spread like I had on uh last month because the stock isn't really near its highs I want to give myself a little bit of room to be right I'm going to go on both sides here I'm going to go to January because 45 days is optimal 24 days uh to put on a trade in December uh just not uh enough time so I'm going to go to to January on this and I'm going to show you something here I'm going to be um",
  "to show you something here I'm going to be um different widths on each one of of these spreads that I'm putting on remember ratio spread is buying one and selling two buying one and selling two it's like a a butterfly buying one selling two buying one but without buying that one that's where you get that extra credit for so I'm going to go $15 wide and I'm going to go all the way down uh to the option that has around a 78 10 Delta on it I'm going to go to the 200 puts I'm going to buy one of",
  "to go to the 200 puts I'm going to buy one of those I'm going to sell two of the 15 puts now you'll notice here that I'm getting around a$1 40ish $1 50ish because these markets are quite wide here um on this spread but I'm $15 wide let's look at as a a standalone trade Standalone trade is a 94% pop I mean if you're slightly bullish because this does have long Delta and has a positive data dec of uh $77 a day max profit of $1,600 because remember we're long one of the 200 puts if the stock were",
  "we're long one of the 200 puts if the stock were to go right down to 185 in the next 52 days and sit right there these 185 puts would be worth zero these 200 puts be worth 15 bucks plus the credit you received on this overall spread um gives you that Max profit of $1,625 buying power $3,800 so it's a standalone trade I I'm well outside the expected move the expected move here or the one standard deviation move is down at this dotted line I'm well outside of that to the downside my break even on",
  "outside of that to the downside my break even on this trade is going to be $15 away from the 170 so just under 170 by the amount of credit that I get here all right so that's good Standalone trade I'm going to put on the other side of this remember you got around a125 or so in credit for that put spread now remember I'm going to go a little bit I'm going to be able to go because it call skue much further away from the money remember I'm only $100 away with my long uh being a 200 put $16 away",
  "away with my long uh being a 200 put $16 away I'm going to go all the way up to the 540 calls I'm going to go around that sameish area you know that 781 Delta I'm going to buy one of the 540 calls let me unclick this so it'll uh just give me one I'm going to buy one of the 540 calls has around that 789 10 Delta and I'm going to go $20 wide here cuz we have $10 wide strikes here we don't have any 545s 555s 565 so I'm going to go $20 wide and I'm going to sell two of the 560 calls now you'll",
  "I'm going to sell two of the 560 calls now you'll notice um the credit now is about $4 for this call spread maybe even $410 because we got a125 for the put spread $410 for the call spread and we're much further away we're 235 away with our um uh call that we're buying that is definitely a great example of call skew now I'm getting a lot more credit for this making uh making it probably advantageous to maybe if you're a little bit bearish on on the overall position just doing the call side like",
  "overall position just doing the call side like we had previously done in coin just a few days ago where were able to make a buck pretty quickly on a down move I'm a little bit more neutral-ish now that coin has had down a move but you'll notice I do have a ne5 Delta on here my probably profit is 92% I only got $530 for this spread maybe you'll be able to get a little bit more you'll notice the markets get a little bit wide up here so please take your time uh filling this order going above the",
  "your time uh filling this order going above the mid price even the mid price right now 547 go in at 555 or 560 and walk it down by you know 2 three cents each time until you get filled uh possibly as close to Mid price as you could remember as the stock goes higher since this has short Delta to it this price is going to go higher and the better higher credit you get on Entry the better it off it is for you you'll notice that it does take twice as much buying power uh as it did for just selling",
  "much buying power uh as it did for just selling the put spread a moment ago it uses $6,200 but but my Max profit on the upside now is $20 wide plus the full credit we receive from the put spread and the call spread which is in my case was $530 brings my break even all the way up to $585 and change $585 in change on the upside $160 or a little bit lower on the downside a very high probability trade of 92 uh percent let's take a look at where we'd have to go to the upside I can't even show you",
  "have to go to the upside I can't even show you because it's just so far away but again my break even $585 I think that Bitcoin has probably run its course uh going into the end of the year so I'm thinking that maybe coin kind of goes sideways we get a little Decay on both sides my break even to the downside like I said is 160ish that's down near its most recent lows made back in September all right ladies and gentlemen that that's my trade for today it use a little bit more buying power than I",
  "it use a little bit more buying power than I like to use but you know what it's a very high probability trade with an extremely high amount of credit too at least in my opinion you know what else gives you a lot of high uh probability trades and a lot of credit moving your account to tasty trade it'll give you a lot of credit with me at least so please move transfer bring aat transfer take your account and just say hey I want to move it to tasty trade you have any problems please give us a buzz",
