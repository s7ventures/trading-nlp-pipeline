  "the likelihood of reversal from open to close I mean could you think of a better day to do this Market measure well I could bit of Wishful Thinking is what I'm hoping for yeah yeah well wishful thinking we'll take it the likelihood of reversal from open to close let's see if it covers what we're doing today a fun study we wanted to do is to see what the probability of closing the opposite of how we opened today so today we'll do just that using the concepts of conditional probabilities I mean",
  "the concepts of conditional probabilities I mean it's nice that we have a big up opening today so we can see hey what are the chances perfect example so we looked at 2005 to present open and closing prices we computed the conditional probability Matrix for the probability of closing up or down given a day where we open up or down so in other words we open up close down or open down close up all right got it got it using a conditional probability table we calculate the probability that spy will",
  "table we calculate the probability that spy will close up given that it opens up and we found now remember this just we went back and we used 20 years worth of data using the conditional probability table we calculate the probability that spy closes up given that it opens up we found that to be around 70% closes up after opens up wrapped right around 70% here are the useful conditional probabilities derived from the table the chance that we close down given that we open up this is what we're",
  "down given that we open up this is what we're talking about today Tony is 35% the chance that we 65% chance that it doesn't happen that standard deviation hold on the chance that we close down given that we open higher is 35% that's where we live today the chance that we close down given that we open down is 58% the chance that we close up given that we open down is 42% and the chance that we close up given that we open up is 67% how long was this study for I'm I'm sorry I missed it was it just",
  "study for I'm I'm sorry I missed it was it just this year no no no this is five years five years all right so we've been in bull market for pretty much five years but I get it yeah and then it's and that's what it shows there because you would think they would be almost symmetrical right with a little bit of positive drift yeah because what's interesting about these what's interesting about these statistics here if you just had these statistics this all you ever had was just this statistic M",
  "this all you ever had was just this statistic M you would be like why AR we always long yes yeah because the chance that we close down given that we open up is 35% but the chance that we close up given that we open down is 42% which means there's 7% Edge in that right and the chance that we close down given that we open down is 58% but the chance we close up given that we open up is 67% then you'd want to be long yes yes of course so why am I short because you like a chane because I like a",
  "I short because you like a chane because I like a challenge exactly hold on let me just put an order in really fast because I like a challenge Mr Batista because I like a challenge that's correct that's correct we are buying back some horrible sales of some Nasdaq futures which is good notice the Chan of closing up regardless of how we open is higher than closing down and that's because we have positive drift these are the conditional probabilities of a reversal situation the chance that we",
  "of a reversal situation the chance that we close down given that we open up is 35% the chance that we close up given that we open down is 42% using the figures on the last slide we see that is roughly 60 66% more likely that we will not have a reversal on a down opening and 91% more likely we will not reverse on an up opening than reverse on each respective up or down opening God this is so much fun the these kind of that um these kind of Statistics they explain a lot of my bad trades yeah",
  "they explain a lot of my bad trades yeah because you're not paying attention here that's what that's what's happening yeah they explain a lot of my bad trades let's go we spend a lot of money to figure this stuff out you're not using it so takeaways given that we open a certain direction from yesterday's close the chance that we Clos in the same direction we opened is roughly 1.6 to 1 .9 more likely than closing in the opposite direction because of positive drift like Tony mentioned the chance",
  "of positive drift like Tony mentioned the chance of closing higher on any given day is higher than the chance of closing lower on any given day MH it doesn't hurt that we've been in a bull market I just want to add that of course not right yeah in a bare Market you're gonna go don't they ever tick up that's like telling us you know that's like a fable or a story because we don't see that ever"
