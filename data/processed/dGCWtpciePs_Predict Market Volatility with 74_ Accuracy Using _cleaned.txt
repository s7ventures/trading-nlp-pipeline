this is I think pretty relevant for what we do because we you know work with this normality assumption a lot we assume that stock log returns are normal right normally distributed that comes from the black schols model that forms the basis for a lot of our statistical assumptions a lot of the models that we use as Traders um right and we know that when we look at real data it doesn't quite fit that assumption right we know that when we look at actual returns they're a lot messier than what this mathematical simplification sort of tells us what quantile quantile plots can do they're basically a statistical tool for comparing two different distributions in a really nice visual way so I wanted to kind of use those today to show some interesting properties about when markets tend to deviate from this normality assumption does that make sense um yeah actually it does does it does it actually make sense it makes sense this morning so far so far it's only page one the introduction so far I'm good we got past the first step Tony that make sense I don't know if I can how longer continue I don't know how much longer Tony I can do the Julia Jacob Within 1 hour combo well I put a lot more pictures in mine I think I I like the pictures so hopefully these should be some fun ones yeah yes let's see if you have more pictures go ahead so uh random thing my eth grade math teacher had this saying that I absolutely loved which is called math is the pursuit of laziness um does that yeah have you ever heard that I've never heard that well we're gonna we're going to try to use math to help understand things in a much simpler way how about that so the normal distribution we're intimately familiar with the normal distribution it's this nice symmetric symmetric distribution that is marked by the sort of central tendency or mean and occurrences that are spread on either side of the mean which is defined by some uh variance right uh which we use an awful lot we use um volatility a lot we use the standard deviation um again for a lot of our statistical assumptions around expected move around expected range um and this is a really key distribution in finance and let's go to the next slide but when we look at actual log returns um for spy for example from 2015 to 2024 on the next side t play we can just look at this more it was hard to make uh when we look at actual stock stock uh log returns we can see that um we actually in reality don't quite measure a perfect normal distribution we got these fat tails you can see that those um two three sigma moves uh happen a lot more often than what the normal distribution estimates um we can see that that it's a lot pointier than what the normal distribution estimates um we see a little bit of asymmetry especially in option distributions right we see the skew um as well as cryosis you call this Fooled by Randomness it could it in fact be Fooled by Randomness perhaps um so we see that our actual realized returns and what we sort of you know expect for the sake of mathemat mathematical Simplicity sort of differ so let's go to the next slide real quick but what we can use to kind of understand this a little bit better are quantile quantile plots um basically this is a statistical tool where we can provide this sort of direct comparison between two types of uh distributions we're really going to plot the slices of one distribution against the slices of another more specifically we're going to compare distributions by their quantiles or slices that slice up the uh distribution into equal probabilities so for example these are the three quantiles of the normal distribution going be three slices that uh kind of divide the divide it up into equal into equal chunks or equally likely chunks does that make sense yeah yeah kind of okay so let's look at an example when we apply this to stock returns let's go to the next slide when we apply this to stock Returns what we're B basically going to do is we're going to take the returns of a stock so here we have data for spy from uh you know April of 24 for a couple of days these are going to be nine different daily returns and each return is kind of kind of act as its own quantile and what we're going to do is we're going to take our Target distribution our normal distribution and slice it up into that number of quantiles or dve that number of quantiles um and then what we're ultimately going to do if we go to the next slide so this is an example for nine data points we're going to plot those against each other we're going to plot the uh the quantiles or the returns of spy against the quantiles of the normal distribution and what we should see if the distributions match we should get a 45 degree line we should get a straight 45 degree line if our uh distributions are basically similar right is what we should ideally pretty close which is pretty close with these nine data points right so what's interesting when we look at actual data let's go to the next slide is that for certain periods we get that nice 45 well not 45 but we get this nice straight line which means that we're seeing a similar distribution between spy returns and a normal distribution we look at log returns from Spy for 2004 to 20 from 2007 for example this three-year period we actually see a pretty normal distribution we get that nice straight line it Bears some resemblance some similarity to a normal distribution let's go to the next slide but what's kind of cool we got we got GIF a clock I love my gifts what's really interesting is that when we move into periods of extreme Market volatility we can see now we're starting to deviate from that straight line and we're starting to see some curvature specifically around these extreme moves that deviate from this nice normal distribution that we were able to observe before um as the market kind of enters into this period of extreme volatility and what we notice is that these deviations tend to occur when one the moves are are very large which is around the two Sigma Mark or 2.2 um 2.2% for spy and also notice that they tend to kind of uh cluster together when you get one they all kind of start to happen at the same time they all kind of which is a concept called volatility clustering when you get these sort of large moves that deviate from this historic distribution um in close proximity and this kind of hearkens back to a stat that we've talked about before which is that when you have a two Sigma move today the overall probability of that happening is about 5% um but the probability of getting another one within 10 days of the first one is about 74% and on average we get about two and a half two Sigma moves even though we kind of assume that they're all sort of equally distributed and in reality when we look at real markets we can see volatility clustering kind of happen in real time um does that make sense absolutely yeah which is kind of cool we've all kind of dealt with that um right so let's go to the next slide there are some implications that kind of come from this um this is uh something that I think a lot of financial professionals a lot of academics agree on which is that um it it seems that the market probably transitions between different regimes or these sort of unique states with these sort of unique characteristics unique sta iCal properties that tend to propagate for a sustained period of time a regime could be a bull market it could be a bare Market it could be a selloff and what we can kind of gauge from these quantile quantile plots is that um the distributions are fundamentally different this normal distribution that described spies returns from 2004 to 2007 now no longer works now and these you know this new regime might have a new normal distribution so we don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water and say normality is kind of out the window but what we can tell is that our historic our historic data which is often used you know to formulate our historic models suddenly have a little bit less reliability specifically when we enter these high volatility periods yeah but you get paid more also that yeah yeah it just kind of means I think like the big takeaway from this Market regimes are something that I find really interesting specifically looking at transitions into different regimes I think like recognizing when the market has gone into a different regime or when it's changed is really important for active Trading especially because we're trying to adapt strategies for new environments and that's also part of why like watching the market as an active Trader is so important because you want to look for those telltale signs that like maybe the Market's moved into one of these different regimes where now our historical expectations our historical data might not be H as predictive of future Behavior right and so like so think about like when the market starts to go off the handle what do we observe we see increased correlations across the market we see increased intraday volatility increased just like CL vix levels for example what else do we see bond prices gold prices start to appreciate defensive assets start to appreciate right um and watching that in real time and being able to recognize that I think is really important for just adapting strategies um to new conditions um so we have a lot of uh I guess like intuitive benchmarks for like the markets moved into a different regime but there's also some pretty cool computational methods for reliably detecting regime shifts uh which uh one of like clustering algorithms in Markov models which are personal favorite of mine Gan mixture models um depending on how much uh I want to torture you guys next week we might talk about one of those so but yeah thank you that was really good I like me a quantile quantile plot yeah I'm sure you too go ahead do the takeaways cuz we got to get going takeaways we got to get going um but just a couple takeaways quantile quantile plots can provide a direct comparison of two different distributions by qu plotting their slices um against each other Dynamic quantile PL plots during extreme market conditions demonstrate that market returns um that deviate from their historic normal distribution tend to be quite large and tend to occur in close proximity of one another which is a concept that we call volatility cluster this suggests that the market May transition between different regimes or states that have their own unique statistical properties that tend to propagate for a sustained period of time although obviously the uh nature and duration and stability of those regimes obviously differs those a lot of the times are triggered by market shocks that are very unique to the market at the time but either way being able to recognize when the market has kind of shifted into a different regime I think is really important for knowing when to maybe uh take our statistical estimates with a grain of salt way easier said than done by the way oh my God yeah that's why the computational tools I think are especially useful way easier said than do it's really hard to do in real time haven't been able to figure out a regime change ever well I you know what kind of inspired this as a little bit was in 2020 when the market was selling off and the market big sell off right in 2020 we were in the office and we had just had our like third big down day in like a one and a half two we period And I remember you saying I can't tell if we're in a selloff yet yeah right right no exactly so because I'm telling you those regime changes are impossible yeah they're impossible but there there are some telltale signs but usually you need to get a little more information to be able to
