implied volatility and strike distance so we've discussed that selling options when IB is higher can lead to better performance we know this we're going to take a look backwards you know we're going to look at the frequency and level of implied volatility by examining the distribution of the vix over the past 20 years because we know as a premium seller we collect richer premiums when implied volatility is elevated so if we categorize trades based on vix into four groups with an equal number of occurrences the vix levels would be divided as follows this is equal number of occurrences less than 13 13 to 16 16 to 22 and then greater than 22 all right next we want to examine how the volatility expansion or contraction impacts strike price colle selection and as a result performance so we tested 16 Delta strangles with 45 days to go and managed all the positions at 21dt and here's what we learned as the vix increases the distances between the strikes and the underlying price for the same Delta options expand rapidly when the vix is above 22 which was the high end of this range the distances for both the put in the call side more than double compared to when the vix is 13 also the credit received as a percentage of the stock price increases significantly pushing the strikes even further so what what happens here um and again you you can see the credit as a percenter price you know when the vix is high now right now the vix is let's call it 20ish just under 20 sure just under 20 be in that 16 to 22 range which is 7% away on the call side and I'm sorry 7 away on the put side and six away on the call or five away on the call side that's still pretty good yeah sure sure okay and the credit received is a big number right now this is where you want to be this is kind of like the sweet spot in this 16 to 22 maybe over 22 is even a little sweeter but you don't want like over 35 or 40 gets really tough in terms of performance uncertainty higher uncertainty and higher volatility and high markets particularly when the vix is between 12 I'm I'm sorry between 16 and 22 it results in slightly lower win rates however all the win rates are great for premium sellers clearly wider strikes in high IV environments lead to much better performance in terms of RLC so what happens here is you can see that we get down to that 16 to 22 which is second from the bottom the win rate 76% which seems like okay that's not great because there's more more of those stocks are in play but the average return on capital is quite High and the credit percent of price remains high so you get so you get paid for the extra risk you get paid for the yeah the win rate drops a little bit but but the return on Capital goes up and the credit as a percent of the price goes up it's just a lot more stuff to do a lot a lot more adjustments to be made just a lot easier to manage the portfolio so a bunch of different takeaways First Option premium is significantly higher in markets with elevated IV leading to wider distances between the strikes and the underlying price that's good because you don't want to get in a situation where where the strike selection is too close or the strike selection is too near where the stock is trading makes it really hard and the benefits uh premium Sellers as the realized success rate and return on Capital are greatly improved even though the theoretical pop Remains the Same at the time of order entry pretty nice I mean good refresher on really basically what you're looking at here is when you have higher implied volatility once again you know everybody will say you know you should think about shying away um from that because you have more risk but really that risk is rewarded by a return on Capital and still a high win rate is that yeah in the tasty world we we kind of go counter to everything else and the higher the implied volatility the better the environment for trading
