how to start trading with a smaller account so we asked the research team to put together something a little different for today we have no unfortunately we have no um Chris beio today because he's on the road for the holiday so we got two pieces of research actually three pieces of research today so as we enter the new year and more Traders start to enter the market it's important to look at how to start trading with a smaller account a lot of people um ask us how to get started we have all these you know all these different videos I did one with my daughter case Tony did one with his son Nick not to mention hundreds of others called where do I start um but we've been doing stuff over the years to get people start in this business and it's just an insane number as insane amount of content we've probably created more options content than I'm going to go on a limb here and say we've created more option content than everybody else in the world combined over the last 14 years as we BAS basically created you know over somewhere between 10 and 14 hours a day for 14 straight years I don't think anybody's even close so with the markets trading at all-time highs it may be easy to overlook the the scope of stock market growth over the last few years in fact Over The Last 5 Years the S&P has almost doubled the NASDAQ has more than doubled the Russell has increased by about 800 points Market's going up a lot sure let's go to next slide so as asset prices rise new Traders find themselves more Capital constrained than they than when they first started out because Capital requirements trade options increased proportionately um to asset prices that's one of the parts of this business I mean you know they as as the market goes higher things get a little bit more expensive to do because everything's based on a percentage of of notional value so unless the stock splits bring its prices lower um we need to find underlyings and strategies to trade and keep Capital requirements low and um the probability of profit high so you know what we found and we put some fun stuff up here in December of 2019 the cues were 211 now they're 531 meta which is Facebook of course you know was 200 it's 600 Netflix was 300 and change it's 900 even McDonald's you know was 200 it's 300 just showing you just some of the growth over the last five years has been insane right and we we you you mentioned McDonald's there just because you know it's a multi hundred billion dollar company that usually does is not like a growth stock it's more of like a dividend paying slow and steady type stock even that Stock's up 30% or whatever um we're going to go to the next slide so simply adding long Wings to like a short strangle for example might not be the only answer even though we still have access to the finders trades be aware that a fixed width spread or an iron condor in an underlying that increased significantly in price sees its pop it's probability profit greatly reduced so what do we do so in order to get the same pop that you had in 2019 your um your wings on a 20 Delta for example iwm iron Condor need to be $20 wide making it much less feasible for smaller accounts partially due to the added skew all that means is you know given how much the market red up it you have to get kind of wide to get the same amount of credit you have to get kind of wide to get the same probability of profit we we put it up here just so you can see with pop in 2019 a iwm iron condor in December was had a 69% pop and if we did the same iron Condor um five years later it's 61% okay you know that's 15% reduction in probability profit for the same exact trade so let's go forward a cool study these guys did yeah they did yeah so to answer the Dilemma it's actually not as complex as it seems due to the beauty of product indifference tasty is all about product indifference it's it's like we're agnostic to product we don't care if it's if it's an ETF if it's an equity we we don't care what it is could be a Future's option doesn't matter so in other words as long as the product you find is liquid that's the key liquidity has a it has a tight bit ass bread the name of the company doesn't matter so much when it comes to the risk reward of the trade so we look look at some assets below that have relatively High implied volatility and a high IV Rank and they're liquid with almost four stars three and a half to four stars they're reasonably priced and the iron Condors or even strangles may be doable for Traders with smaller accounts so just to show you we put up here a couple of names like fxi the Chinese ETF ewz the Brazilian ETF um GDX a gold mining ETF and SLV these are all inexpensive stocks now my favorite as far as liquidity goes um but we have positions on in GDX and fxi right now but so so we do trade them and you can see for strangles Capital required is a very small amount of money on a relative basis $500 $300 $500 you know $400 so they're doable for most account sizes let's go to next slide small accounts tend to be Capital constrained from doing undefine risk trades which is why tasty Traders often opt for Define risk trades how can we strategically choose undefined R strategies like strangles and short puts or short calls whatever so they would be available to smaller accounts maintaining the benefits of the undefined risk trades um and obviously this has a lot to do with implied volatility so next slide Beth for both low and high IV underlyings using a defined risk strategy will cost between 20 and 40% of the credit received depending on implied volatility so we gave an example here of two stocks Delta Airlines and CMG we're trying to go all over the place with this Delta Del with a high IV CMG with a low IV and we showed you kind of just the difference in um because they're both about the same price 61 or $62 so you got a lot more credit with Delta because the um I'm sorry you got a yeah you got a much bigger credit on a one standard deviation strangle you got a much bigger credit on a one standard deviation iron Condor because it had higher implied volatility and so you end up with just you know big more credit we're just High impli volatility you're saying right yeah yeah just due to higher implied volatility yeah same Delta nothing Delta same price right yep same Delta same price twice as much money right okay let's go to next slide so when using undefined risk trades in low implied volatility stocks you get a sizable increase in buying power required however in high implied volatil stocks the percentage increase in buying power is much less allowing you to used more undefined risk trades so we gave another example here this is using the same two stocks this time we looked at a strangle versus an iron Condor and it's Delta and CMG again and you can see the iron Condor is going to use the same amount of money but the difference here is the one standard deviation strangle and the percent change in buying power just you're using more buying power is the point um so the these are these are buying power reductions this is not credit received buying power so the strangle in CMG requires more money because the credit you receive is less the strangle in the percent change is 58 compared to 36 in CMG so use a lot more money because of the low implied volatility where is when you do an iron condo it's gonna be the same sure sure iron condo is never going to change because it's defined risk let's go to next slide you know what you will receive a little bit more credit on the higher implied volatility of that's that's why that's why the requirement lower right so some of the takeaways many popular assets have more than doubled in price over the Last 5 Years increasing the difficulty for new Traders with limited Capital so Define risk strategies cost 25 to 40% of the credit received however undefined risk in high IV stocks offers a Better Credit divide credit over buying power reduction ratio and a smaller buying power reduction increases making undefined risk trades more feasible for smaller accounts and new Traders should focus on product indifference prioritizing High liquidity moderate to high implied volatility high pop and low Capital requirements over specific asset names it's a pretty heavy study for an intro study but I think it covers so much good stuff it's really well done
