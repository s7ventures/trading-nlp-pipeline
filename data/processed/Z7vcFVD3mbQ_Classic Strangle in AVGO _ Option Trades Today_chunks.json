  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today January 2nd the first trade of 2025 uh but first as I always do let's take a quick look at the market &ps down $450 now that's a very small move but let's take a look at what's going on here today you have an $80 handle top to bottom on the &ps when I woke up this morning when I went to bed they opened up 13 but time I went to bed they were down 20 handles when I woke up they were up 50 handles they've been",
  "I woke up they were up 50 handles they've been all over the place but yet volatility basically unchanged up 18 cents hasn't made a new high since last night 1765 is where we are right now little bit of churn here going on the market uh with now three indices lower that's the NASDAQ the Dow and the &ps and only the Russell are the highest I don't like when the is the highest for the breath of the market myself so I'm going to try to pick a neutral strategy for today let's see what I'm going to",
  "strategy for today let's see what I'm going to do you know I like to avoid earnings so I like to click on this little uh earnings here and get rid of all of these earnings so I can have all the stocks that don't have earnings here uh one of them that came to my attention avgo I'll put it up here for you see where it is as we go a little bit lower there it is avgo uh up $380 if it's up around $3.80 when you make this trade today you probably get filled at a better price than me but $2 $235 stock",
  "at a better price than me but $2 $235 stock um stocks at a good range today it's up near the higher end of its range even though the well I guess mid-range for the day 235 239 uh being the high so mid-range for the day Ivy rank is lower by two and a half% I prefer this number to be green but it's got a good Ivy rank of 40 one of the highest on the board and it has good option markets let's take a look at these markets they're two 3 cents wide two 3 cents wide pretty good 10 cents wide on some",
  "3 cents wide pretty good 10 cents wide on some of the larger calls good size markets in avgo here good bid ass differential so what are we going to do in avgo well avgo had that big gap up about a month or so ago it's been going sideways I'm going to play it sideways here today also let's take a look at what I'm going to do I'm going to go to a classic one standard deviation strangle what do I mean by that I'm going to go to around the 15 Delta on each side I'm going to the 200 call on the I'm",
  "on each side I'm going to the 200 call on the I'm sorry the 200 put on the put side and I'm going to go up to the 280 uh call that's going to give me two uh short Deltas I got filled at $548 I got filled right at Mid price so maybe you can get filled um right at Mid price also here you can see right now the mid price is 550 which is even better remember the higher credit you receive the better off you are this is pretty much a delta neutral trade here I guess you can move this put up one if you",
  "here I guess you can move this put up one if you want to be long a Delta and a half or if you move it lower I just went by pretty much on Delta meaning 15 Delta versus 13 Delta um and I also went on price $274 $274 and basically $2 74 so they equal priced options basically equal equal Delta options you are only $35 away on the put side and you are a lot more than that on the call side right so you know you're you're $45 away on the call side for those that are playing at home that's what you",
  "those that are playing at home that's what you call call skew so if you wanted to go equal distance away you'd have to move this this this call in close to be at the same uh if you don't want to play the the skew I play the skew meaning if they're going to give me a higher price further out of the money option for the same credit that's where I go uh this this trade has about two short Deltas too it has a 77% pop a good interesting thing you can see here on the tasy trade platform which is a",
  "see here on the tasy trade platform which is a really nice uh illustration here's that one standard deviation line on top on bottom and this green line is your uh p&l um graph so you'll be able to make money in between or under 195 and in between 280 and 290 above 280 uh 285 if you got filled at 50 cents 28550 would be your um break even to the upside your break even to the downside would be1 19450 if you got filled at $550 uh cents so a good outside the standard deviation um trade here this is",
  "the standard deviation um trade here this is a classic strangle High IV rank see the IV rank coming in here a little bit but High Ivy rank stock going sideways good markets on each side outside of standard deviation giving us that 77% pop we know we like to have a probably a profit above 65 all I want is time to go by and the stock to go up stock to go down and then allowing me to make a little bit of a profit I got feel at $548 maybe you can get filled a little bit better but I know you should",
  "filled a little bit better but I know you should be getting filled at only one place that's tasty trade please transfer move bring your account to tasty trade aat transferred over everything moves over and kind we support all the products we'd love to have well most of the products can't say all with the attorneys please bring your account to tasty trade help us keep the lights on here and happy New Year to all of you [Music]"
