  "the reliability of beta weighted Deltas we get a lot of emails um over the course of whatever it is like it could be a month a couple months there were people asking you know like because tasty defaults everything to Beta weighted Deltas on the top of the page how reliable is that number if it says I'm short am I short it says I'm long am I long how reliable is that number do you want to take a guess percentage wise how reliable that number is I have lots of different positions on so so I'm a",
  "I have lots of different positions on so so I'm a good test 72% of the time no it's better than that is it no I'm I'm happy it's overperformed how reliable not enough like numbers no how reliable do you think the number is on just if you were say like is it 90% reliable is it 95 is it 85 80 75 103 you're a little off on that but as far as reliability goes it's about 85% it's about 90% reliable we're going to show you that today how reliable is it well 90% is pretty damn good if you could take",
  "it well 90% is pretty damn good if you could take all the different positions you have on and some are highly some are very highly correlated some are not that highly correlated some have weird beta weightings some are Futures some are Commodities everything you throw it together it's still about 90% % accurate that's pretty damn good so beta by definition is a fundamental tool for managing systemic risk in a portfolio by comparing all the underlyings to a benchmark such as spy we only use spy",
  "to a benchmark such as spy we only use spy this is the Apples to Apples um of the trading business nobody else ever did this for retail customers we came up with this 25 years ago it was really a TP thing we were messing around with a bunch of different tools T TP came up with the idea of beta waiting a portfolio for retail investors we started it we've um kept it you can get this at thinkers slum now you can get this obviously a tasty and maybe there's like maybe another firm I I'm not sure if",
  "there's like maybe another firm I I'm not sure if interactive brokers has it but we changed the whole industry with respect to active Traders using beta weed portfolios there are two equivalent definitions for beta of an underlying um and we get into a lot of the formulas here because we have some physicists and some math professors and other things and people want to see you know the actual um formulas that we're using to create um uh to basically create the definitions that we use on the",
  "create the definitions that we use on the platform but what what we wrote here is more intuitively this is thought of as how much to expect ABC stock to move given a $1 move in the underline that's our beta waiting and how reliable is this expectation or how reliably does this expectation play out in reality so we use 15 years worth of data which is plenty spies iwm TLT Q's Amazon Google and Tesla for each day in the past 10 years we computed the betas the beta beta weighted Deltas based on the",
  "betas the beta beta weighted Deltas based on the previous 5 years of returns the same methodology as the platforms I'm sorry these are just beta values we contrasted that's just the relationship between the underlying and the snps we contrasted the realized daily moves against those predicted by Beta and the Spy moves via the correlation the average absolute eror as a percent of the daily move and its root mean era similar metric but which penalizes large errors more for context we reported on",
  "large errors more for context we reported on the correlation between each underlying and the Spy over the whole of the data set again I don't I'm not sure anybody's ever done anything like this before but welcome to Tasty this is actually fairly ground breaking in the sense that I haven't seen this study before anywhere so the correlation with spy if used iwm is 88 and no surprise there if you use Q's .93 no surprise there this is over 15 years TLT it would obviously be the inverse so it's a",
  "TLT it would obviously be the inverse so it's a .32 those all make sense the correl between predicted and realized moves is actually almost what just what you thought um you know it's it's pretty damn close to the to the to the actual correlation with the Spy no surprise there because the numbers work the math just works but here's where we get down to kind of let's talk about the average error it's a percent of the average move so in iwm it's 7.7 in TLT 12.2 and the q's 4.2 so when you think",
  "7.7 in TLT 12.2 and the q's 4.2 so when you think about these these errors are relatively small I mean TLT little bit more but mostly all of our stuff is in stock indices and stock indices it's closer to 5% which means that the beta way dels is like 95% accurate when you look at the big outlier moves which is the root mean Square era they're a little bit higher in iwm and qes but it still basically averages under 10% about 8% so for the outliers so this is really interesting in this sense that",
  "so this is really interesting in this sense that the average ERA is pretty low now if we go to different equities go to the next Slide John so Amazon Google and Tesla are equities they only have a 6.69 and 044 correlation to the snps so their correlation is much lower when you have a lower correlation you're obviously going to have higher uh higher error count because because that that's just the way marks work if there's a lower correlation then then everything is going to be a little less IM",
  "then everything is going to be a little less IM balance the correlation between the predicted and the real moves spot on freaking spot on Amazing the average error here is a little higher than the indexes of the last slide Amazon 84 google2 I mean 12.3 and Tesla 9.3 and then the outlier moves even a little bit greater as well but still pretty well under 10% which means that the number that we show on the platform you know as far as our beta weighted um as far as our beta weighted deltas and our",
  "um as far as our beta weighted deltas and our Greeks are pretty damn good very nice agree I mean like in my account I'm taking you know 70 or 80 different positions beta weting them to the Spy and coming up with something that has uh an error less than 10% I feel pretty good about that I don't think I could come up with better let me put it to you that way no um that's really interesting that's really really interesting really well done beta weighted Deltas give us an apples to app's way to",
  "weighted Deltas give us an apples to app's way to look at the total systemic risk across our portfolio how much do we expect to gain or lose from a $1 move in the market but the value of that expectation is closely matched with the strength of each underlying Market correlation so less correlated more wiggle room for error typically realized price changes were within 10% of the values predicted by Beta although Q stayed much closer and the lower correlations underlyings had noticeably higher",
  "correlations underlyings had noticeably higher root mean Square errors which meaning they most likely kept they're close to the beta um weighted Delta predictions when they varied they varied big and low correlation underlyings are the key for increase in the number of occurrences but be careful because their beta weighted Deltas are small it doesn't mean that their prices are stable just that their moves are hard to predict there's a lot of good stuff yeah a pretty good little tidbit there too",
  "stuff yeah a pretty good little tidbit there too so really good at predicting the the typical move that the stock is going to have but no way of predicting the outlier move and that's why they call it an outlier move right I mean that's really what they're saying yeah don't don't sleep on this study this is good"
