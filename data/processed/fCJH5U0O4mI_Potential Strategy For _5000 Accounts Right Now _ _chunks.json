  "what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video we are going to cover a poor man's covered [Music] call all right looking to get a couple trades on this morning e- Min is up 16 the NASDAQ of 120 volatility at its lows which lends us to a new type of trade that we haven't done in this portfolio I'm going to be looking at Target Target trading at 130 it had earnings a",
  "at Target Target trading at 130 it had earnings a couple weeks back the stock move from 155 all the way down to 120 it's bounced a little tiny bit to 130 here but even if you look on like a longer term chart let's just look at like five years um we'll go back to the monthlies as well I mean we have reversed years of price movement we're back to you know early 2021 here mid to early 2021 prices I think it's an interesting spot to get a little bit of long Delta here and do something that we",
  "bit of long Delta here and do something that we haven't done in this portfolio Poor Man's cover call so this is a uh more Capital efficient way to be long the stock short a call covered call so um when you buy stock in a margin account you get about 50 or uh two to one leverage on your stock right so it uses about 50% of the cash value of the shares so if you were to buy 100 shares AT3 $30 it would use the notional value of that position would be 100 uh would be $130 per share so 13 Grand on",
  "be 100 uh would be $130 per share so 13 Grand on that position in buying power you you only use half of that so 6,500 bucks in buying power around half that value selling the call in this circumstance and I just picked the January expiration just to show you this example would reduce the buying power a little bit but you're still using you know $6,200 to be long the stock short the call very Capital intensive position even in a margin account so for me in a smaller sized account I have to",
  "so for me in a smaller sized account I have to figure out a way to be more Capital efficient while still maintaining that position or that sort of Delta so what we do in a poor man's cover call as we go a little bit further out in time let's say like you know 50 to 90 days depending on your duration here I'm going to look at February uh which is a little bit further out in time here and we'll want to be long a call um that is in the money that'll be at a Delta that's you know somewhere between",
  "be at a Delta that's you know somewhere between 80 and 95 right when you get to a higher Delta the option is going to get more expensive and you could see this on the Chain here uh in terms of the value of the the option the further you go in the money the more of the value is intrinsic value versus extrinsic value when you think of extrinsic value extrinsic value is equal to the outof the- money put so if you were to buy this 110 call for example you would be paying 51 cents or around 51 cents",
  "you would be paying 51 cents or around 51 cents over the intrinsic value of this option and so that $51 is essentially the cost of that long stock position or nearly long stock position um so for me I want to use about $11,000 would be like my Max on this and that's just from my position and my um Capital efficiency in this account uh you can go further in the money if you'd want to if you don't mind using a little bit extra Capital so for me I'm going to go and say around this 120 strike so",
  "I'm going to go and say around this 120 strike so this going to be a little bit lower Delta than i' I'd like to be at but I'm trying to keep this at about a th000 bucks in terms of the short call we want to go in that that normal you know 30 to 50-day time frame for the short the long 50 to 80 so you have that about 40-day window 30 to 40-day window between the two options so in January I would look at somewhere around the the 135 strike I'm going to sell that at $3 you'll see this uses about",
  "to sell that at $3 you'll see this uses about aund $1,000 in buying power you have a total of 36 Deltas which is a little bit low the Delta on this option is is 38 so if you were long stock short this call you would be net 62 Deltas versus me that I'm going to be at 36 deltas so a little bit uh lower uh Delta exposure than the actual cover call would be but I'm using 20% of the capital that you would use to be long the stock short the call in terms of my break even you could see my extrinsic",
  "terms of my break even you could see my extrinsic value on this position is basically zero which means that I'm my break even is right at where the stock is trading so about 130 on this position um when we look at this on on the risk profile here so we go to the curve mode we click this analysis button you could see this sets up very much like a normal cover call if we look at the at expiration uh you have you know basically that cover call type risk profile above 135 there's no more uh profits",
  "risk profile above 135 there's no more uh profits to make your break even to the downside is going to be at 120 because you have that capped risk you are synthetically long a put here because you don't have the physical shares so a very Capital efficient way to belong the stock for uh you know pretty decent amount of time so we're going to put this on 1062 see if we get filled on this position no fill there move this 1065 all right so we're filled 1065 uh that puts us a break even right at the",
  "1065 uh that puts us a break even right at the stock price our poor man's cover call closing order here coming up in Target it's been just one week the stock trading at 130 and change it is now at 136 so we've had a Sixpoint rally this was a perfect move and it happened very very quickly so it's time to go on this position so when we close this position out we would be looking at buying back our January option which is our 135 call and then we would be selling to close the synthetic stock",
  "we would be selling to close the synthetic stock position the 120 call we had in February uh this is currently Trad at 1290 is depending on where we got filled be somewhere around a $225 profit depending on where we got filled so let's try 12295 not a whole lot to say for this one I mean just given the move that we've had in Target that's why we're at this amount of profit I mean we had you know a pretty sizable amount of long Delta going into this let's go 1285 just to get filled there we go",
  "this let's go 1285 just to get filled there we go we got filled $220 profit on this poor man's cover call synthetically Long the stock short the call"
