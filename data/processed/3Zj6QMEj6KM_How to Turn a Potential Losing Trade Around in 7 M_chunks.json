  "what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video we are going to cover an iron [Music] fly I'm looking at a trade that I don't do a ton of and it's because it's a very slow moving trade but you really need to be uh High volatility underlying for this sort of trade trade I'm looking at paler and I'm thinking maybe an iron fly sets up nicely here so if you look at paler",
  "fly sets up nicely here so if you look at paler it's a stock that has absolutely exploded to the upside it's very much a um has had a lot of social Buzz to it to say the least uh I'm looking at this implied volatility of almost 70% implied volatility when you get into the earnings expiration which is out in February you got in the 80 handle implied volatility so very high implied volatility stock has come down a tiny bit and and the biggest issue here for this stock is that it's got a little",
  "here for this stock is that it's got a little bit higher margin requirement because of how high that volatility is if you were to do a strangle here naked it would use about 2500 bucks in buying power which is too big of a position for my account so for me I'm going to look to do an iron fly which is a straddle right at the money the 70 strike stradle you can see a big credit of $10 and change but uses a lot of buying power and then we're going to buy the wings just to cap the amount of buying",
  "to buy the wings just to cap the amount of buying power that we're using here we're going to want to reduce this down to you know somewhere around $1,000 maybe a little bit less than $1,000 here so I'm going to go here I'mma buy 15. wide wings so we're going to look at the 55 strike for the long option on the on the put side and we're going to go to the 85 on the call side you'll see this sets up with a pop that's 42% and that's because your buying those wings your your risk profile is within",
  "those wings your your risk profile is within the expected move here so it's a a lower probability trade but you're playing into what is a 60 IV Rank and almost a 70% implied volatility so you have a lot of volatility baked in to this position to give you some context if this tra if this underlying were to see a five or 10 point drop in volatility this spread would certainly certainly be profitable assuming that the stock stays somewhere around this um this Mark here somewhere inside the",
  "this um this Mark here somewhere inside the expected move which you would expect if if you get a volatility contraction so we're going to Route this at an $852 credit we'll see if we get filled here for this kind of 5050 High Vol play that we're looking for in paler we'll do it at here those markets are moving so I'm gonna move this to 845 see if we get p filled a penny above mid price we actually got price improved to 856 on this iron fly so we're looking for a move between 60 and 80 over the",
  "looking for a move between 60 and 80 over the next 37 days for this to be profitable we'll see if that happens but stick around CU we're going to do some Management on this TR we've had some two-sided action the stock has gone uh from you know the 70 handle up to 85 we're back to 75 here so we've gone $5 in the money on the call side of course no problem with assignment here lots of extrinsic value in a stock like this a high volatility stock moving stock a stock that moves a lot dayto day so",
  "stock a stock that moves a lot dayto day so no issues there we do have 15 days to go till expiration which is getting down to the last part of the expiration you can see we've got about $3 of extrinsic value on this position the way we can look at that is just by taking the put strike which is let's call it about a$ 130ish and then the in the money call strike is actually going to have the same amount of extrinsic value as that out of the money put so $2.50 or 60 is what I have left to make on",
  "put so $2.50 or 60 is what I have left to make on this position if the stock stays right where it is and the stock has actually rallied significantly uh in the last hour or so when I was looking at this position you could see we move from 73 to 75 I'm looking at my p&l values and we're looking at about $120 profit at the early part of the session this morning uh but that has since eroded a little bit but still doesn't take away from the message here um so anyway with 15 days to go till",
  "message here um so anyway with 15 days to go till expiration the decision now is to either close the position or roll into either the same position in the in the further out expiration or a new position you could go to do multiple different things here for me I think it's just a close take some money and run on this position uh it's one that when we got up to 85 which was basically the high of the Year 8480 this was a losing position now we've had a little bit of a pullback we're making some",
  "had a little bit of a pullback we're making some money on the position I think it's time to just take the profits and move on to another position so to close out of this position one of the things that I I make sure I look at is to make sure there's a bid and an ask on the long options if there isn't you want to just remove those options from the closing order because they have no value but there is value in these about eight or nine cents on the downside so if we can get H filled here for a",
  "the downside so if we can get H filled here for a little bit less than the mid price let's see if we can get 85 C profit here which would be 761 fill price on this no fill there go up to 65 no fill there and you'll see that within the money options your there we go we got filled as we were talking but in the money options you'll see your bid ass spread be much wider than the out of out of the money options and thus you know it makes it hard to fill um you might have to adjust the price a little",
  "um you might have to adjust the price a little bit above or below the mid price depending on if you're buying or selling so anyway we routed that closing order 765 debit Nets us out an $881 profit but really the key here was that we had a little bit of a sideways move here or at least ended up as a sideways move uh throughout the duration of the trade [Music]"
