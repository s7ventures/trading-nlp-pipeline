  "Welcome to Option Trades Today. I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you on January 21st, 2025. The S&P is up 32 handles, with a range of almost 80 points. NASDAQ is also experiencing similar movement.",
  "NASDAQ is under 6,000, with the Russell up 37 and the Dow up 443. Volatility is up by 66 cents, trading near the lows. I watch the volatility Futures (VX) as the best indicator for daily movement and volatility. The vix Futures remain weak, indicating a potential extended move to the upside.",
  "Volatility in futures may lead to rallies or slight declines. Bonds are up 23 ticks. Bitcoin had a wide range last night, currently sitting at 106. Oil is trading between 75 and almost 78, currently at 76.21 with an Ivy rank of 28.",
  "7621 Ivy rank is at 28, showing an uptick at the higher end of its range. I will use an omnidirectional trade in oil. Looking at the high option volume list without earnings, oil stands out as a potential opportunity.",
  "When put in order, there are not many stocks with expanding IVX 5-day change or high IV rank. These stocks are difficult to trade due to low implied volatility. I am entering CCL now, despite being a poor commodity trader. I made this trade when oil was down around 90 cents, which may have moved a penny or two, a decent size move.",
  "decent size move on the option sides because these options are now $10. I'll explain that to you right now. I'm looking to use the March options. If you look at the Futures trading at 7617, you'll see that the February options are tied to a...",
  "February options on the Tasty Trade platform are tied to a different month future. Each option is clearly represented by the corresponding future. For example, the current month is trading at 76, while the next month is at 75. Consider looking at March options with 55 days to go instead of options with 34 days to go.",
  "34 days until expiration. I will show you why I am opening up these options. There is low volume and wide spreads in the markets. Moving on to March options with the at-the-money strike around $75, these options have good liquidity and tighter spreads.",
  "Good markets are typically two to three cents wide with plenty of volume on each side. The price of oil is trading at $75. The at the money line is between $75 and $75.50. I will execute a one by two ratio spread trade. This trade can be done in an IRA account.",
  "You can now trade this option in an IRA account, but it will require double the buying power. For example, an option priced at $1 is actually $1,000 in premium due to the larger size of oil future options. This trade is significant even when made in small amounts.",
  "I'm looking to buy the strike with a probability of at least being in the money, around the 20 Delta options. These options have a 50/50 chance of touching the number.",
  "I'm choosing the 83 strike for a slightly bearish trade in oil. I'm buying one 83 call and selling two 86 calls for a 32 cent credit.",
  "I placed the trade at the mid price of 33, looking to get filled at 32. The trade involves a credit of $320 and requires $4,100 in buying power. Max profit is $3,320. I am long one 83 call and short one 86 call.",
  "Short one 83 call and long one 86 call. If oil closes at 86 at expiration, the 83 call is worth $3,000 plus the $320 credit received, for a max profit of $3,320 on $4,000 buying power. In an IRA account, buying power would be around $8,700. Buying power is subject to change.",
  "Buying power for Futures options can change as you approach expiration, especially when options are near the money. This buying power can increase significantly, sometimes up to double. Be prepared for this change and ensure you have enough buying power available.",
  "With $320 in buying power, Theta Decay is $115 a day. This trade has an 89% probability of profit (POP) with a break-even point above 89. Risk and reward expectation is to aim for a profit of $200 or $100 by buying back at 22 or 12.",
  "At 22 or 12, I could make $200 and $100, respectively. Remember your max profit is $3,300 with $4,000 of buying power for this trade. There is no risk to the downside. If you don't think oil will reach new highs, this trade may be for you. Consider transferring your account to Tasty Trade, the top broker firm.",
