when do you take profits on a butterfly fire away I mean to me a double a triple would be like a home run in a butterfly easy answer here is how do you manage one that isn't working you really don't you took your shot it either it's open and close it's toine risk there's nothing you can do how do you take profits on it well that's really subjective and like Tony said sometimes you know one two three four times whatever you paid for it and sometimes people just go ah screw it I'll just let it go all the way to the end I mean that's kind of what a butterfly is nobody really knows you just unless you're doing big giant wide butterflies then you can kind of you know try to take dollars out of it if you're right but if you're doing a tight one where you're risking a little to make a lot you know just pick a number
