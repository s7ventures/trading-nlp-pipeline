  "let's see what to consider before putting on iron Condors let's let's go to the next slide so yesterday we explored the optimization of wing width and buying power requirements using neutral strategies like the strangle and iron Condor following this study we received inquiries on how to easily demonstrate the advantages of widening Wing widths compared to narrower wings with present lower risk which present lower risk for novice and and limited account sized um Traders so in response we",
  "account sized um Traders so in response we compiled statistics to highlight additional reasons behind all that discussion that we had yesterday okay it's important to mention that when setting up an iron Condor we have multiple choices select such as selecting the strikes to sell the contracts to use and the width of the Wings let's go let's take a look let's break it down typical for us we go 45 days to expiration we manage 21 days even though it's an iron condor we used 10 years of data and",
  "it's an iron condor we used 10 years of data and we looked at varying widths three um uh three strikes wide five strikes wide 10 oh there's your bond bonds 28 look at you 3510 and 13 strikes wide we compared the win rate the SAR the buying power the return on Capital and the cumulative performance of the average p&l we basically broke it all down mhm so what to consider before for executing an iron Condor um what Tony and I like to do is we're kind of middle of the road iron Condor players what",
  "of middle of the road iron Condor players what that means is we definitely don't do them too tight and we definitely don't do them too crazy wide so like we're kind of in the middle somewhere so if I had to say what are we we're probably the five to 10 Range Five would be pretty tight I think we're more the $10 range but sure I think a lot of the NASDAQ stocks that we end up trading or higher price stocks um and that's why you go to a $10 wide okay let's go next slide okay so say we're five or",
  "let's go next slide okay so say we're five or 10 yep and Y but we we kind of don't do the I mean we're mostly strangles we don't do the 13 Delta wide we rarely do the three Delta Wide Wings right um and the 20 Deltas for the short strike is probably pretty good for us 20 25 so the wider the wings the more closely the performance mimics the same Delta strangle the tighter the wings the less the win rate the less premium collected also the less buying power used and this is all like something",
  "buying power used and this is all like something that shouldn't surprise you but you can see where we are here at those 10 Delta Wings we're kind of right in that you know 61 verse 71 and you can see our numbers are about half of you know what we would take in premium wise and the buying power is I don't know 1/4 MH about 25% we usually figure back of the envelope we say between 20 and 25% that's the back of the envelope if you're only only taking in like like like if you're doing three Deltas",
  "in like like like if you're doing three Deltas wise you're doing using $300 forsus 6,000 in a strangle so it's 20 to1 that's that's only 5% that's that's way too narrow sure if you're doing about 20 to 25% which would be you know which is something like around the 10 Delta um that's okay like I to me that makes a lot more sense um and that's where we like to be on most of our defined wrrs so we don't want to be it's not like one 12th we want to use maybe one quarter 1th that's our back the",
  "to use maybe one quarter 1th that's our back the envelope kind of an idea that that we're kind of collecting enough premium let's go to next slide I also don't like that 52% win rate you know in the cheapies right you'd rather be in the in the 60s right the Cuma of pnl over time provides an overview of how the varying Wing widths perform over the same period using um the iron Condor strategy and you can see here there's two there's two of those lines below zero and there's no real reason using",
  "lines below zero and there's no real reason using the snps and managing at 21 days over 10e period why you would ever want to do something that ends up to be has a negative return it's below the zero line the 10 Delta 13 Delta have a positive return that's your answer I mean you don't have to go any further than that that this is I mean some of those have those are pretty consistently below the zero line and the other ones are pretty consistently above except if you take you know the pandemic",
  "above except if you take you know the pandemic really dragged down the averages but still The Wider you go the better off you've been let's go next slide and those are cumulative pnls okay even though the tight iron Condors exhibit a lower risk profile um as shown by the sear and the worst loss the worst case loss metrics they may lead to negative Returns on buying power and capital deployed over time um there's there's clearly okay now again this is these are cumulative over time so it's a",
  "this is these are cumulative over time so it's a little different than the way you would really look at anything in a more traditional you know you don't look necessarily cumul over time but but still um you can see the three and five and the other ones were just small positive and the strangle was the most positive that's why like undefined risk the best but we tend to stay in that 10 Delta maybe we even go further maybe go a little bit higher but based on this study um the worst losses are",
  "but based on this study um the worst losses are feel like they're in line with everything else and the C I feel like is in line um I don't think those are none of those numbers are crazy I think they're just what you would expect but I think the takeaway from the segment is you want to stay away with from from Delta widths and from the narrow width iron Condors where the long-term C of p&l is a negative number I know it's attractive to not have to put up much money I know it's attractive to",
  "to put up much money I know it's attractive to have the low C and the small buying power doesn't work if you hit one out great but so although tight iron Condors require less buying power they're low average p&l their negative return on Capital and their win rates just don't justify consistent use you want to do it on a one-off basis go ahead but consistently if we increase the wings the trades more closely replicate the performance of a strangle while using much less buying power than a",
  "while using much less buying power than a strength so is it is it exactly no it's not you pay for the right to Define your risk you pay for the right to limit your risk you pay for the right to use less Capital it's expensive but"
