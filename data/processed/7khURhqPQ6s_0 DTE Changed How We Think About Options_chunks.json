  "profit Targets in depth let's have some fun with this managing winners is the Cornerstone of tasty mechanics we have traditionally closed our 45-day expiration short premium winners at 50% of their Max profit in order to increase our win rate and allow us to redeploy Capital to new positions our recent experience in zero DT markets has caused us to experiment with different Target profiles different Target profit targets we're going to investigate if 50% is really optimal or should we consider",
  "if 50% is really optimal or should we consider these on longer trades or should we consider adjusting our profit targets based on the initial features of the trade you know Tony and I like to use 21dt but what do you want to use let's take a look and see what is truly optimal so we use 15 years worth of spy data we sold 45 data expiration strangles each monthly expiration cycle at a variety of Deltas we consider the average panl that would have been reached by managing winners at every",
  "have been reached by managing winners at every conceivable profit Target from 1 to 99 % we were looking for the most effective profit Target to use based on strike selections all trades were closed at 21dt okay you good I'm good so far all right it's where it gets a little bit chunkier let's go to the next slide okay so what am I look who whoa what am I looking at here okay so this is the average p&l for straddles 50 Deltas on both sides and let me just see what this says look negative across",
  "me just see what this says look negative across the board hold on am I reading it right it's the mean your head a little more well I I'm trying to I'm I'm trying to see it's the first time that I've seen this particular slide and so first time you new hands the what we're what we're looking at here is the first thing we're looking at is the average p&l for strangles and you for strangles so what's on the left what's on the left left hand side I I that's the mean pnl portray okay and and the",
  "I I that's the mean pnl portray okay and and the zero line I I made a mistake the Z the zero line is more towards the middle bottom of the of the graph correct about one two three three higher right yeah I got it now thank you guys yeah yeah made a little made it a little easier to see so you have the average P for straddles and then you have there you go and then you have the um the profit Target percentage remember we're going for kind of that you know that that 50% area and then um well 50%",
  "you know that that 50% area and then um well 50% 50% no you're looking at more of like a 10% here right 5 to 10% of the straddle otherwise otherwise am I read well it looks like 30 is optimal like right right around 30 yeah yeah yeah what this is going to show is that optimal profit tar well I shouldn't say optimal but the average p&l for straddles if you put them on sell the 50 Delta call 50 Delta put and you manage them at 21 DTE you're going to come in somewhere just around let's call it the",
  "come in somewhere just around let's call it the 30 to 35% range okay and and it looks like your R and your risk is about 15% am I reading that correctly yes so your risk is your your your your profit to risk is almost two to one in your favor yes what it shows is with 15 years worth of data if you when you put on a straddle initially it's all over the place like you're going to you're you're always going to be losing a little bit at first winning a little bit they're going to be stles are",
  "a little bit they're going to be stles are really hard to manage but after a certain period of time which in this case you know in this case is up 21 days because we use 21 days across the board the optimal areas in the mid-30s let's just call it okay okay because remember we're looking for profit targets as we fast forward let's go next slide what happens here is as the Deltas get a little bit smaller profit Target goes up so instead of being in the mid-30s it's in the low 40s now and we don't",
  "the mid-30s it's in the low 40s now and we don't usually do 40 Delta Del strangles but you can see here with 40 Delta strangles even that even when they first start out for the first 10 or 20 days you know your p&l is all over the place you're going to have negative p&l but then eventually it comes back to be positive and it kind of sits around there and it doesn't make a lot of sense to hold it past the 21 days because it kind of flatlines after that this is more towards the areas where we get",
  "that this is more towards the areas where we get to so I think what they're trying what the research team is trying to show you is that if you go to a smaller Delta like the 20 to 30 your profit Target at that 21 days actually goes higher because you're collecting less money so you collect less money your profit Target goes your your your your profit Target goes up goes up into that 50 55 range and after the 21 days are kind of flat lines but when you first put on a position this shows you that",
  "you first put on a position this shows you that the first 10 20 days you know it's all over the place you you're down money you're up money you're down money you're up money okay and I I think that this is actually a really good visual because it's showing you that as as you reduce the Deltas you can go your profit Target goes up to the percentage that you want to make these are all still at 21 days like the next one should be 20 deltas and so this is kind of where we live in that 20 Delta",
  "so this is kind of where we live in that 20 Delta range and what's interesting about this is the nice thing about 20 Deltas is you don't have those draw Downs early on you don't necessarily making money right away but you're not drawing down like you are on the 50 40 and 30 Deltas the 20 Deltas tend to always kind of work your way because we usually don't go under those numbers and then you maximize profits you know at around 60 plus percent at 21 DTE that's why I like this that's why I kind of",
  "DTE that's why I like this that's why I kind of like this the 20 Delta range and then go to the next slide and then here this is the 16 Delta this one this one is less interesting to me we usually don't get down to 16 Delta but you're they didn't draw the yellow line here but but it's the the same thing it's going to be up in the mid-60s it's be a little higher than the 20 Delta and then it flat lines after that and no draw Downs early on if we go to the next slide if we go to the next Slide",
  "go to the next slide if we go to the next Slide the takeaways very low profit targets make for frequent winners but their effects on long-term p&l were erratic and with small mechanic variations having large differences in results so very high profit targets never triggered reaching before reaching days to expiration management so so like trying to say you want to make 100% is unrealistic using profit targets slightly below the average 21 dtp no levels was able to consistently outperform and",
  "no levels was able to consistently outperform and will be more time efficient than days to expiration management alone so with strikes around the expected move this made the 50% profit Target close to Optimal somewhat lower when trading close to at the and somewhat higher when trading far out of the money but the 50% averaged out to be pretty accurate which we've been talking about all along"
