  "Exploring profit targets is key in trading. Traditionally, we close short premium winners at 50% of their max profit to increase win rate and redeploy capital. In zero DT markets, we are experimenting with different profit targets to see if 50% is truly optimal.",
  "50% profit target. We found that using a 50% profit target was optimal for our trading strategy based on historical data.",
  "We managed winners at various profit targets from 1% to 99%. All trades were closed at 21 days to expiration. The average P&L for straddles with 50 Deltas on both sides was negative.",
  "average P&L for strangles is negative across the board. The left-hand side shows the mean P&L for strangles.",
  "The zero line is more towards the middle bottom of the graph. The average P for straddles and profit target percentage are key factors to consider when trading. Aim for around a 50% profit target.",
  "When trading straddles, focus on managing around 5-10% of the straddle at the 21-day mark for optimal profit. Selling the 50 Delta call and put can result in an average P&L around 30.",
  "Typically, the profit range for trading is around 30-35%, with a risk of about 15%. This results in a profit to risk ratio of almost two to one. Historical data shows that initially, straddle positions may fluctuate before eventually becoming profitable.",
  "After 21 days, optimal profit targets are in the mid-30s. As Deltas decrease, profit targets increase to the low 40s.",
  "In the mid-30s, it's now in the low 40s. We typically avoid 40 Delta Del strangles. Even though the P&L may be negative initially, it eventually becomes positive and stabilizes. It's not advisable to hold it past 21 days as it tends to flatline.",
  "The research team suggests that targeting a smaller Delta, such as 20 to 30, can result in a higher profit target at 21 days. By collecting less money initially, the profit target can increase to the 50-55 range. After 21 days, the profit levels off. This data illustrates the impact of position entry on profit potential.",
  "When you first enter a position, the first 10-20 days can be volatile with fluctuations in profits and losses. As you reduce the Deltas, your profit target increases to your desired percentage. Aim for 20 Deltas after 21 days to optimize trading strategies.",
  "focus on trading within the 20 Delta range. This range helps avoid early drawdowns and typically leads to consistent profits. By staying above 20 Delta, you can maximize profits, especially around 60% or more at 21 days to expiration (DTE).",
  "I prefer the 20 Delta range over the 16 Delta range. The 20 Delta option tends to perform better, with a slight increase in the mid-60s before leveling off. The 16 Delta option is less appealing as it typically remains flat with no significant drawdowns.",
  "moving to the next slide, it is noted that setting low profit targets can result in frequent wins but may have unpredictable effects on long-term profitability. Small variations in strategy can lead to significant differences in results. Setting very high profit targets may not be realistic, as they may not be reached before expiration. Setting profit targets slightly below the average 21-day time period was found to consistently outperform other approaches.",
  "No levels consistently outperformed days to expiration management. Strikes around the expected move made the 50% profit target close to optimal. The 50% profit target was somewhat lower when trading close to at the money and somewhat higher when trading far out of the money. Overall, the 50% profit target was pretty accurate."
