  "I typically choose a wing for zero DT strangles by selecting a $20 to $30 spread, with a short Delta around 20-25. I aim to collect around $5 in premium.",
  "Short strangles have higher probabilities of profit and upside compared to similar defined risk strategies like Iron Condors.",
  "Selling a 30 Delta strangle with zero DT in the SPX has a buying power requirement. Adding cheap far out of the money long options can give similar results to undefined risk trades while controlling buying power.",
  "Is my buying power requirement for a 30 Delta strangle on SPX 0 DTE? Let's take a quick look. It will be around $120,000, which is approximately 20% of a $6,000 index for a one lot strangle with 30 Deltas.",
  "For a 30 delta strangle, the premium is around $8. To make $800, you would need to put up $120,000. Trading these products involves a lot of money. You can also consider a normal condor strategy.",
  "requirements can impact the buying power needed for a synthetic strangle position. It may be beneficial to explore ways to reduce this requirement while maintaining the same position. Let's analyze this further.",
  "Regulatory BPR minimums do not account for time remaining. There is not $120,000 in risk in one lot strangle because the market cannot move that much in a day. Buying a cheap option can reduce risk. Using two years of data in the SPX zero DTS, we analyzed...",
  "analyzed two years of SPX data, focusing on 40 Delta, 30 Delta, and 20 Delta triangles at market open. We are now searching for the closest to at-the-money put with a bid of 30 cents, 20 cents, or 10 cents. The bid must be at least 30 cents.",
  "On the put side, the short would be at 6070 and the long at 6000, with a $70 difference. On the call side, the values would be determined accordingly.",
  "On the call side, the price range is approximately 6,900 to 6,115. This means less buying power is needed on the upside. The put side will mirror this with a 700-point range to the downside. Prices will be provided for both sides.",
  "We will show you the prices and how they affect your put skew. Your put spread will be much wider, providing more buying power. The call side will only be $30 wide, compared to $300 on the put side. Everything is 10 times an SPS.",
  "Total cost of the Wings impacts buying power and protection frequency. Starting with 40 Delta strangles, the cheapest put at 30 cents was actually 37 cents. The 20 cent put was 25 cents and the 10 cent put was 20 cents. On the call side...",
  "call side were we're talking about the calls being more expensive at .71 43, but the average daily buying power reduction for this trade ended up being $8,200, a fraction of the $120,000 for the naked position. The protection on the call side was essentially zero.",
  "4% on the call side, 40% on the 30 Delta wings, and lower on the others. The main takeaway is that you can use less capital by buying cheaper options.",
  "For the study, aim for symmetry in both sides of the trade. Options offer lower risk compared to stocks. Avoid widening the spread too much for minimal savings. The setup is similar with the 10 C puts offering no protection historically.",
  "The purpose of this presentation is to show that regardless of the strangle you sell, the wings will be about the same. The 20 Deltas are all virtually the same in terms of percentages and buying power reduction. The further you go away from the money, the cheaper you put a trade.",
  "When selling a naked strangle in the SPX, you can put up less money, typically 90 to 95% less than selling a naked call or put. It's a strategic play on buying power. I can't think of any reason not to do this.",
  "consider adding a Wing to your strangle trade in SPX for potentially higher gains. This strategy may allow you to hold the trade longer and roll up the untested side quicker for more profit. Elevate your trading game by exploring this option.",
  "go to the last slide to purchase far out of the money wings and control your buying power when trading zero DT strangles. To create Iron Condors that function like strangles, start by finding a cheap long put and adding a symmetric call. The more buying power you commit, the cheaper a put you can use due to put skew. Using cheap long calls may result in more expensive long puts.",
  "If you're selling iron condors, you can balance how much you're willing to spend on wings with the resulting buying power reduction (BPR) effects. Keep in mind that the BPR may vary daily. Now that we understand this, we can confidently look to sell zero DT strangles."
