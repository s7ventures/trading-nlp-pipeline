we're going to cover elections today and we're going to cover the months leading up to the elections August September October ready I'm ready okay months leading up to the election do you think that there's some kind of trend that we should know about August September October you know what I think it's almost like a buy Russia sh sell yam kapor sell russes buy yam kapor what does we have these sayings out there in the market that I don't think have ever been really tested tried and true and you have enough of the so what are you saying August September October it's like every other Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday I think it's going to be random I don't think there's going to be any kind of trend or something to follow here maybe there's a volatility thing but I don't even think even that's going to have anything to do with Octobers have been crazy throughout same as it ever was Octobers have been crazy throughout history yes it has but they've been crazy for reasons other than elections 1987 the crash was in October no election 1989 the crash the mini crash was in October no election there were elections looming but but no not really in the the point being is that we rarely see election activity mooved the market 2008 we were in the middle of a meltdown so that was an election thing and then I I would say in 2016 the market definitely ran up after the 2016 election but in October it was a little weak prior to it so let's see if we can come up with anything that looks really interesting being an election year implied volatilities remain quite average so far with an overstatement rate of 86% over the last 12 months all right that sounds here's the S&P historical volatility here's the S&P implied volatility you can see the implied volatility has overstated you know generally speaking the implied volatility is overstated but I think that's what you're looking there is a pretty normal chart of implied over historical what should we expect in terms of price volatility and implied volatility in the months leading up to a presidential election how typical was August and September compared to past election years and how does the volatility compare to any other year we're going to see so we went all the way back to 2000 we looked at the SPX and the vix I think the vix started just after started trading on the vix just after 2000 so that's about as far back as we can go we observed the days in August September October in presidential election years in 2004 08 12 1620 we computed everything you wanted everything you ever wanted to know and more about historical volatility implied volatility price change monthly price variation and then compared to the same months in non-election years here we get into the meat are you ready August and September of election years tended to exhibit average implied volatility but low historical volatility this suggests that the actual price volatility was significantly muted despite an election coming up that is your first big takeaway initially the numbers suggest that price volatility was muted despite an election October before elections were more volatile than August and September although 2008 I'm sorry was a large outlier that may have skewed may have thrown everything off because 2008 if you remember 2008 of October volatility got ran up to about almost 80 and that messed everybody messed up like historical numbers forever but you can see here that um normal normal electioneers implied average implied volatility historical implied volatility are pretty much in line and October is different again 2008 really messed up that skew is what it is the actual average monthly price variation was so small back then I it's surprising to me the average price changes for the month leading up to election seem to suggest that August was a strong bullish month and September and October were very bearish however are the variation is also very large this means there is no statistical evidence to any directional trends that may be observed that's pretty interesting because when you think about it August very bullish September and October very bearish this is since 2000 again a lot of this is skewed in 2000 and 2008 but it is what it is and the monthly price variations obviously go up interesting stuff for non-election years August and September are actually more volatile than election years that's all you need to know for non-election years August and September actually more volatile than election years a non-election October was less volatile and was very similar to August and September even when comparing to election years the volatility difference between these months is quite insignificant and that is really the key here when you go to the non-election years it's basically no change I think this would be more about let's talk economic meltdowns than election years yes right okay yeah because I think that's the big difference the monthly price variation is larger than the size of the average meaning there is no directional Trend in any month this was a really critical takeaway for us and again we wanted for a long time we wanted to do this study we looked at non-election years since 2000 and you can see here the average monthly price change and then the average monthly price variation I don't think that there's much in there that suggests anything different from a some of the takeaways from this very extensive study when looking at expectations for implied in volatility for August and September the presence of an upcoming election presented very little difference so a lot of the talk about the elections again very little difference very little difference what did you I should have asked what did you think from these results do you change any of your no business as usual doesn't mean anything business as usual it's almost like it's almost like you're trading an earnings play it's business un usual up until you know the earnings sure October in election year was more volatile on average but not because of the election itself the capitulation in 2008 Ur mostly in October and was the main contributing factor to the higher average bottom line there is no significant directional Trends in any month regardless of an election yeah
