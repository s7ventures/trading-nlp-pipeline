Market measure that our research team put together for you how can we quantify risk during earnings periods um we talk about risk is a fundamental aspect of investing and when we get into earning Seasons it's when I don't know there's a little height more heightened volatility along with heightened volatility comes sharp price swings and also a lot of you know uncertainty whether they're going to maintain those rallies like in Tesla they did maintain the rally for a couple days today's day three by the way I actually don't like Tesla here with the help of back testing found on on tasty which we now have on the web platform we grouped stocks in in four groups based on their product and examined how we can quantify risks of earning season not the easiest thing in the world but let's take a look 2018 to present so 6 years worth of data 16 Delta strangle we're going to look at a bunch of different sectors the tech sector the consumer retail the entertainment sector and the autom SE Automotive sector and then calculated Risk by using different res risk metrics and then compar the results it's a really good study the team put together so the first thing we see is since 2018 we've been able to observe the timing of most earnings announcements and this enables us to evaluate their influence on stock volatility and risk by randomly selecting stocks from the top of the S&P 500 that are available in our back testing tool we can perform cas studies to explore the effects in Greater detail and so um well this first slide is is just all the different earnings traits just showing that that we have lots of data nothing more let's go to the next Slide John this is where we start to get into the meat during during earning season Tech and semiconductor stocks like apple Google and AMD show a solid average win rate of 70% % don't forget this has been since 2018 so it's been a pretty good Market however the risks are high especially for Google um with a Max loss of this number doesn't mean anything because it's a but it's a one lot of 3600 and significant volatility AMD with the lowest volatility and and the lowest cbar appears comparatively safer the risk adjusted rois are 19% indicating decent returns but with notable V variability so essentially looking at six years worth of data here and just looking at the tech stocks we threw up some some interesting you know things like hey okay let's sell the 16 Delta strangle you end up with the win rate of 70% you end up with a Max loss obviously that's pretty high the max loss is a percent of the buying power is um uh 19% the Sears which doesn't seem too bad as $1800 the risk ad adjust adjusted return on investment which is which coincidentally is also 19% and the volatility of p&l is plus or minus $1,000 okay so that's I mean 19% return for you know that's your earning season all right not bad let's go next slide so we did the same study for Consumer stocks which have a much lower implied volatility right like Nike Amazon Costco they have a win rate is really solid 73% however there were some big losses specifically in Amazon and um when we did the whole thing over a period of time because you can't just cherry pick we found that the return on investment was very modest at 2% showing that you know what these were tough stocks not worth the risk the volatility of p&l was 4,000 the volatility of pnl tech stocks was only 1,000 so the difference here is that you made a lot less money you took a lot more risk and it wasn't a great sector for risk return just you know simply put it just wasn't yes correct if you go to the next slide now again we're just trying to quantify risk we're not trying to like say this is easy or it can be done you know in the future this one here we looked at entertainment stocks we looked at you know Netflix meta I'm not sure I would call Met well media and AMC throwing that in there and the average win rate was a lot higher the average um C the sear was lower and the risk adjusted return on Capital was highest at 21% and the volatility p&l was significantly lower at only $1,200 the media stocks AMC Netflix and meta were was probably the best of anything we've looked at so far better than technology and better than the Consumer Stocks by a long shot yeah yeah and if you go to the next slide Sean so this one's interesting because we looked at automotive and we said okay well how well did Tesla Boeing and rivan do you know just trying to grab some stocks now you're in the stocks we trade right yeah we trade we have positions on in Tesla Boeing and rivan for sure rivian were smaller in there because it's only a $10 stock now but over the last eight years has been significantly higher uh Tesla for the high- risk tolerance and potential turns Boeing for moderate risk stable with moderate risk with stable returns and rivan you know for lower price let's call it lower risk investment what's interesting here is that the cabar was significantly higher the volatility of p&l significantly higher the win rate was about the same and your return on investment was negative so part of that's Tesla part of that is you know part of that's Tesla part of that's Boeing which had some big moves but the risk return is negative a couple of before we go to the takeaways from the research team let me give you my just a few of my takeaways from this okay I don't think you can look at any sector and say you know going into the future five or eight years from now six years from now whatever that this trend is going to continue what I think is interesting is that there is a multi there are multi-year sectors here which have done better than others but generally speaking the results the return on investment has been un earnings place has been what I would call very marginal meaning that two of them were basically you know one was unchanged one was negative and two were in the 20% range given the risk that you're taking given all the what they called here the variability of these different things there's not a lot of there's not a lot of evidence here suggesting that for the risk you're taking you got a huge reward that you get the bang for your buck the whole volatility contraction the whole enchilada of strategies moving very quickly in one day I I kind of feel like there's nothing here that stands out to me that says you know that that these are great dues and there's nothing here that says to me that they're not worth doing you know I mean they're an engagement tool like we've said all along they're fairly priced they're random they're an engagement tool let's see what the research team had to say uh there was a tech semiconductor okay I missed that this is just an overview of all of them and so you can see the win rates across the board all in the same category the the max loss gets is is pretty wide the um the sear also pretty wide and what's surprising is that before you looked at this you would have guessed that the tech semiconduct space would have been the riskiest and it turns out it was the least risky for the best return and with the lowest volatility of p&l which is really surprising so in other words you look at this and you're like what I thought would be the riskiest was the least risky of the group let's go to the last slide go figure right right so in our previous study we uh we Quantified stock price movements during earning season and assess the performance of defined vers undefined trade strategies this study focused on quantifying the risks associated with the earnings announcements which is essential um for Traders earning season increases investment risk due to heightened volatility especially in sectors that are more volatile stock movements depend on how earnings results compared to Market expectations to manage these risk investors should diversify their portfolios trade smaller positions and use you know mental stops I would say when necessary these stocks the stocks analyzed are examples of our back test testing tool categorized by products and services they offer you can also use this tool with different stocks to assess their risk reward and volatility we've been spending a lot of research effort using our own tools because we want to show you what you can do with the technology that we've built again to me talking about the back testing tool now on the web of uh of tasty trade correct yeah but to me these results show a lot of Randomness and they show risk where you didn't think there was risk and if you go back one slide Johan to number eight slide number eight for a second you can see here that I mean you would just think that consumer retail would be I don't know the most boring of all those of all those groups and it had it had the most risk and the tech would be the riskiest it had the least amount of risk so it's not always as easy as it seems I'll just leave it there
