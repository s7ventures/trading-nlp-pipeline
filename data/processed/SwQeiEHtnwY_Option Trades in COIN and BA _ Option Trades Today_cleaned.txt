welcome to option trades today I Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today December 3rd 2024 hey not one trade but I got two trades for you guys today that's correct but first as we always do let's take a quick look at what the Market's doing &p is down $7.75 hey I don't know if you know this but if you uh take this little line and drag it you can make it uh smaller down here and bigger up here maybe you have two or three uh different settings that you have down here for charts anyway I made the top bigger by just grabbing this and moving it a little bit lower even S&P is down $7.75 NASDAQ up $10.75 the Dow up sorry Dow I'm sorry Russell down $19.80 and the Dow down 183 volatility in by 5 cents saying to about this Market hey if volatility is not going to percolate down near these lows meaning volatility go higher it's going to be hard for this Market to get really anything going substantially to the downside it looks like at least from a volatility standpoint that it's smooth sailing to the upside for now so take a look at volatility for any kind of movement in the market you know what I like to do here I like to go to our watch list I like to put it uh I like to put IV rank from going from high to low just by simply clicking on the ivy rank that'll make it go from high to low or you can go from low to high or any way that you want to do it I also like to see the ivx 5day change be green it's it's going to be very hard with volatility as I showed you fvx trading near the lows to see any type of volatility going to the upside and the high Ivy rank but I found two the first one's going to be coin let's take a look at that you'll see coin down here at the bottom IV rank of 47 is very nice in this market environment meaning that it's high relative um there's no earnings uh in coin so we're good there the ivx 5day change is down 8% over the last 5 days and that gives me a little bit of like well I don't want to sell premium on both sides I want to be a little bit directional now you know um we had a nice trade in coin last week where we took a buck bucking change on a trade very quickly I'm going to do something very similar to that this time but not quite um as strategic meaning not doing both sides I'm going to do one side I'm going to be omnidirectional slightly bearish on coin but man coin's going to have to double or more in the next month that's in the next not year in the next month the next 45 days for us to be in trouble on this trade if not we collect ourselves uh a nice little buck and change what am I going to do up here well I'm going as far up as I possibly can just about I'm going to look to and I wanted to show you volume here there's plenty of volume being traded here so you're all good here even though the markets seem to be a little bit wider uh this is probably in the money this is Delta and this is volume let's change volume and look at implied volatility if you want to you'll notice that implied volatility as we get higher which is quite normal even in a stock like this that has uh a call skew that the volatility continues to go higher the higher up you go that's how you get something that's you know the 640 and 650 calls are basically the same price and there's not so much difference between the 600s and the 640 because volatility keeps up ticking you'll notice on the downside uh that volatility does exactly the same thing volatility keeps up taking that's why these lower priced options um don't uh evaporate as quickly as you would think they get to a certain point uh and they just can't go any lower because you know what taking that risk off of the table for a liquidity provider is worth something and volatility keeps up ticking so we're going to try to take advantage of that with 45 days to go you know it's optimal 45 days is the time frame that we think is is the sweet spot for putting on trades High IV rank I like to have the ivx 5day change also going higher which we do not have on this trade so I'm going to skew my trade a little bit by going in One Direction what am I going to do I'm going to keep this pretty simple I'm going to buy the 600 calls once I'm going to sell the 650 calls twice you'll notice that the mid price here um is a well now it's a $145 because that's exactly where I got filled at a145 matter of fact it was A14 three mid price when I got filled on a do there you go $1 37133 when I got filled at a145 the stock was actually up a buck or so higher than this there you go now it just moved a little bit matter of fact if you go to the watch list here if you have a I'm sorry not the watch list if you go to the follow page and you have a tasty trade account and you just click on Bob the trader you'll see my two trades from today and you'll notice I made this trade when the stock was uh just about 311 it's 308 right now and I got filled at a145 there's the Boeing trade I'm going to give you in just a minute too but I wanted to show you that um coin you'll notice that we took this one off last week or at least I did you could take it off for a better price than I did right now probably I did it for a 430 debit probably trading for around $380 or $3.90 today I got a couple of emails you know why take this off for such a quick Buck profit when you had such a a large win ratio here meaning uh you know it was working for you um a big tent a big green area on any type of um risk profile that you see here why take it off well you know what just put the trade on on the 29th uh I'm sorry we just put the trade on the 26th take the trade off three days later hey run like a thief in the night is what I like to say but you could certainly keep that trade on let's go back to the one that I want to do right now I'm buying the 600 calls one time I'm selling two of the 650 calls and I got filled at a dollar 49 uh $145 with the stock trading right here now this is going to show you a high probability of profit because we are well outside the expected move I mean the expected move is only $60 with the stock trading at around 310 will round up that brings you to 370 well this stock is going to have to go from 300 to 600 or more to 650 more than that because our break even is $700 7 $100 on the stock trading 308 this is really a way that I look at using capital and getting a return on my money a145 credit for the $6,200 um that I have at risk here my Theta on this is $10 a day better than bonds at least in my point with a high probability of success Delta's -3 on this it is omnidirectional because if we close right at 650 the 600 650 call spread which were long one time will be worth $5,000 plus the $145 that we got credit in here because the $650 calls will be worth nothing if the stock is right at 650 that gives us our Max profit of 5145 what am I really looking to make on this I don't know 100 bucks 110 bucks 120 bucks uh again it's a way to put $6,000 and change to work to me with a very high probability of profit uh on a stock with a with an upside potential that maybe you can even catch a catch a nice middle a nice tweener here where the stock goes slowly up to 610 620 630 and these 650 calls will lose a little bit of premium and these 600 calls will gain a lot of Premium remember there's no risk all the way down to zero on this trade and that's why I call it an omnidirectional slightly bearish trade even though you make your most money with the stock up at 600 $150 where you make $5,000 in change if not you collect the $145 for the $6,200 and change in risk that you have in coin all right next trade next trade is going to be Boeing ba haven't traded Boeing in a while uh Boeing's been on a little bit of a tear to the upside I know it's significantly off of its highs of 260 or 70 bucks here but it's well off its lows of 138 and I think it's going to meander around in here why do I think that now listen nothing else than just my own Silly opinion again you have to have an opinion when you're trading if you go to the follow page you'll see my Boe trade when did I put this on well when the stock was right here we'll see how much this has moved $3.85 I sold a strangle strangle and high ivr uh is what I put in here you'll notice if you want to see all my Boeing trades you can just click on Boeing right here and you'll see here's about 30 or so um or maybe uh 30 different Trad trades or three months of Trades I don't know you can support at tastytrade.com can give you the uh can give you how much is is here you can see these are trades back from oh it looks like almost a half a year or so maybe six months of Trades but here's all my trades you can see how I did uh in Boeing maybe I'll have the same success here or maybe I did really bad in Boeing you could check it out and see what's going on uh maybe that's a trade you don't do Ivy rank of 38 let's go back to the follow page I'm sorry let's go back to the high option volume list and see where we can find Boeing here's Boeing it does have an ivx that is slightly green by about 1% The Ivy rank is significantly low at 37 and change matter of fact if you look down here you'll notice it's at the lower end of its range not really uh when when Boeing was going stratop feric here uh to the upside uh volatility was actually kind of percolating to the upside as it's been going down volatility been up ticking um so maybe volatility come a little bit lower here with the stock going a little bit higher what am I looking to do in Boeing I set a strangle I'm going to go to the January options because 45 days is optimal for me there's no earnings looming I'm going to sell the 140 puts which have around a 20ish uh Delta around a 20ish Delta 17 here 19 uh% probability of being in the money I'm selling the 140s and I'm going to go up to the 175s 20ish Delta also gives me a little bit of short Delta 2 and A2 or so I don't think that's uh um a lot I think I consider that delta neutral brings me right outside these dotted lines which gives me a 71% probability success if I was inside those dotted lines it be closer to 65% $11 in Theta Decay actually higher than what I was getting in coin per day by using a lot less buying power 15 or6 $100 in buying power collecting $3 85 Which is higher than the $145 uh I was receiving for a coin you'll notice that my coin credit I received was a $145 this is 380 two times or more as much as my coin uh credit I received yet the Theta Decay is $10 versus $11 you would think that if all things were equal that my Theta decay in coin would be half as much five or $6 $7 versus the $11 but no that's because the implied volatility monthly implied volatility is so much higher in coin than it is in Boeing selling to 140 175 using $15 or $1600 in buying power Max profit $384 you'll notice how the Delta moves ever so slightly as the stock goes a little bit lower I got filled right here well actually 385 one tick one penny uh higher than this and gets me outside of the expected what would I do here um if I get in trouble I get that that question a lot because you know the profits take care of themselves the stock stays here you make a buck or two and you get out of the trade that's easy well if my Delta on this overall trade gets to plus or minus 15 I will move up or down the untested side so for argument sakes if the Delta on this trade got to around 15 or 16 short Deltas I would move up the puts until I got you know 5 7 10 Deltas on that trade if it happened tomorrow I would probably only have to move up one strike because you'll notice there's 17 Deltas here 26 Deltas here that gives me nine Deltas if I were to roll up just using this as a really quick example and I had 15 short Deltas I would pick up nine long Deltas that would leave me six short Deltas on the overall trade and conversely if I got long 15 Deltas I'd move down by one strike and that would pick me up my Deltas that I need that's how I adjust all of my trades and I'm pretty
