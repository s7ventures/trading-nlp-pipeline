  "let's do it higher order option Greeks sounds important the Greeks are metrics that we use every day in option trading to help us better gauge the health and risk of our portfolios technically Greeks are all simply first derivatives of the black shs model we have spoken about the main option Greeks many times in our research studies but what happens if we keep going deeper looking deeper into derivatives yeah yeah this would lead us to a lesser known higher order option Greeks derivatives of the",
  "higher order option Greeks derivatives of the primary Greeks that provide deeper insights into the risk and sensitivities of our option positions just keep keep on driving yep keep on driving I know Jacob loves these keep on dering now that should be a t-shirt let's go next Slide the Greeks measure the rate of change of a specific variable with respect to another variable for example Delta is the rate of change in options price relative to $1 change in the price of be underlying asset a second",
  "in the price of be underlying asset a second order derivative can be thought of as the rate of change the rate of the change of the rate of change let me think about that for a second the rate of the change of the rate of change yep got it in other words they measure how much the main first order Greeks change with respect to a specific variable this allow us to see when our Greeks are most optimal in a trade leading to better management so basically we're going to like prove all of our",
  "so basically we're going to like prove all of our mechanics once again using the these Greeks why we uh put on specific trades the way we do and yeah the uh rate of change of the rate of change gives us the most optimal uh ways to put on the rate of change of the rate of change I thought it was a cool a cool way I do like that let's go next slide Beth all right so this is what we're talking about today charm vama um who thought of V it's like the worst name ever um color color yeah Vana and row",
  "worst name ever um color color yeah Vana and row yeah these are all Greek names apparently and you have the derivative with respect to so what this is basically saying is charm is uh Delta the derivative of Delta with respect to time BMA the derivative of Vega with respect to volatility and so on so that arrow is a fancy way of saying what we're deriving with respect to so that's why we get the second other the second order option Greek from got it yep so let's just see charm Delta vama Vega",
  "it yep so let's just see charm Delta vama Vega color gamma BNA Delta andice price with respect to interest rates okay got it I didn't know row was a second order gek I always thought it was the first order yeah I don't know because okay yeah a lot of people people put it in the higher order because price uh is with Delta always so then I mean you keep deriving on price again got it got it got it okay let's go to next slide Beth all right here's where it gets a little complicated let's take a",
  "where it gets a little complicated let's take a look here what what are we doing here so I mean all of the so I try to keep this very simple when explaining all five so we have the formula uh the definition the mechanics and then a nice graph uh to go along with it just to explain it so the formula for charm that uh symbol uh means partial derivative so it's just uh going over what went over in the last slide so charm is uh deriving Delta with respect to time and uh that's a definition so it",
  "respect to time and uh that's a definition so it tracks Delta is time decay aing in delta neutral strategy management and the mechanics are it's that it's lowest for the at the money options uh and it increases as you go further out of the money money the interesting thing about this graph is that it's a negative y- axis so a negative y- axis means that the numbers are getting bigger as you go to the bottom so that's why we have higher charm out of the money and then lower charm as you get uh",
  "of the money and then lower charm as you get uh more in the money and the application for this is I mean this is why we trade out of the money options because uh Delta has a much um higher uh or Delta has a much higher Decay as you head out of the money versus in the at the money so you're able to collect more premium and on a relative basis on on a relative basis and and yeah okay I got it so lowest for at the money options due to the smaller Delta Decay increases as you go further out of the",
  "Decay increases as you go further out of the money option as you go further out of the money options all right makes sense the first tasty mechanic is this is why we trade out of the money got it let's go okay B oh okay so what do we got here so vomma is Vega's uh uh Vega and volatility so it's deriving Vega with respect to volatility and the important thing about this is that it Peaks at around 5 to 10 Delta and then it actually uh is at its lowest point at the at the monies and this is why we",
  "point at the at the monies and this is why we trade around the 16 to 35 because I wrote down over here volatility changes too much when you're out of the money obviously because the VMA is at its highest and then it changes too little when it's at the money uh so that's why we kind of trade in the middle when it's uh around the 16 to 35 Delta Mark so that's another one of our mechanics that comes from BMA basically because that's where you get the most bang for your buck well uh you get too",
  "the most bang for your buck well uh you get too much bang for your buck uh if you move uh at the money and then you get too little if you move out of the money because we don't want that's where that's where you you have the most you're at the most optimal point on because you don't want it to move too much otherwise you're going to you know you're going to breach all your strikes and you don't want it to move too little you're not going to collect enough premium so we uh take The Sweet Spot",
  "enough premium so we uh take The Sweet Spot yeah that's good that's a good picture all right let's go next slide color color yeah that symbol the upside down L is the symbol for gamma if anybody uh wanted to know that I mean uh we use it sometimes but mostly we just write down gamma uh it so it monitors gamma's time change uh and this uh is what we know about we've talked about it 100 times in our research studies gamma increases as we get towards expiration this is why we manage our trades uh",
  "expiration this is why we manage our trades uh and the actual uh definition of gamma changing over time that line that's what color is so yeah well that's interesting yeah yeah gamma peaks near expiration meaning Delta's also change dramatically that is why we manage our trades that's why we manage our trades early yes that's why we man our trades early yes um exactly because an option can go from zero to 100 in basically two ticks MH got it let's go to next slide ah little van yeah van no no",
  "go to next slide ah little van yeah van no no uh graph for this one but uh this one is Delta's volatility uh sensitivity so uh uh deriving uh Delta based on volatility and uh this is why we adjust our positions based on volatility shifts impacting Delta all this is saying is that being long V means that you're paid quickly when you're right and heard when you're wrong uh heard quickly when you're wrong and to combat this we diversify across strategies expirations and we can hedge our Deltas uh",
  "expirations and we can hedge our Deltas uh the reason we're doing all this is to basically manage our volatility basically so different strategies are optimal in different volatility environments different expirations and obviously uh hedging our Deltas also allows us to control our volatility as well yeah well the nice thing about tasty mechanics are that we pretty much sell things in high valve but we don't buy things in low valve so we don't have to worry about the one half of this um yeah",
  "have to worry about the one half of this um yeah all right good I like it yeah yeah yeah yeah all right next one and finally row I mean don't get scared about this actually we're going to get a very nice takeaway out of this so this is price with respect to interest rates so it assesses price sensitivity to a 1% change in the interest rates uh and the mechanics are the biggest effects so yeah interesting is that interest rates most affects the stocks that are in the banks brokerages mortgage",
  "stocks that are in the banks brokerages mortgage and insurance companies in the financial sector because that's when going to be dealing with interest rates the most uh and so for uh these three down here I took a random sample of 10 financial sector stocks over 10 years and calculated their yearly cumulative change in basis points uh because in order to see a large change you need to have a large amount of basis points so we go by the year I know many people do their studies with five or 10",
  "know many people do their studies with five or 10 years changes in basis points and we can actually see that if you are have a rate change in the year of 25 50 or 75 basis points uh the change in oper option prices is only going to be 5 cents or less uh if it's between 100 or 200 it's going to be between 5 cents and 15 cents if it's greater than 200 it's only going to be uh 15 cents or a little bit more so the takeaway from all of uh from this giant slide is that row doesn't have that much",
  "giant slide is that row doesn't have that much impact is that row does not have that much impact exactly so a lot of people think interest rates uh impact option prices a lot and like we need to be trading around the news a lot when the FED announces all these things but the reality situation is it has some amount of effect and you can track it but not that much when I first got in this business and rates were like you know 15 to 20% or over 10 there was a lot of price sensitivity in options to",
  "was a lot of price sensitivity in options to interest rates but especially in the back especially in the back month especially in the back month especially in like a lot of our positions we put on that stuff's been gone for for 25 years now yeah yeah right so you're right let's go to the last slide I think the last side yeah these are your takeaways okay so takeaways charm helps manage Delta's time Decay especially useful in optimizing delta neutral strategies or focusing on selling out of the",
  "strategies or focusing on selling out of the money options OB provides insight into the volatility of volatility guiding traders to bounce Risk by choosing options in the 16 to 35 um Delta range color is crucial near expiration tracking gamma's time tracking gamma's time change to Aid in effectively hedging And Timely adjustments for Rapid Delta shifts manage early you don't have to deal with that vaana allows traders to adjust Delta exposure based on volatility changes inuring strategies",
  "based on volatility changes inuring strategies remain aligned with market conditions again we're aggressively adjusting man early you know roll forward don't deal a lot with that and then row evaluates the impact of interest rates changes on option prices in this point you what your R is negligible focused on other Greeks and the more useful first order Greeks so I mean all of these Greeks proove our tasty mechanics uh and I'm saying row is negligible but really all of these are also have",
  "negligible but really all of these are also have little impact on on our uh trading strategies and stuff like that so it's really useful to focus on the main your Delta Theta Vega and but it's still nice to know about all these and how it impacts if you keep deriving the model you can get some really interesting results out of it so"
