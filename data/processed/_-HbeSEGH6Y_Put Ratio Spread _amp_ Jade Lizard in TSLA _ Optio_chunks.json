  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today February 11th only 3 days away from Valentine's Day not going to want to miss that sweetheart of yours don't forget flowers always work Candy's really good but don't go in empty-handed all right what are we going to look at in this market we've got an empty-handed market right now even the S&P is down four really doing nothing fairly tight range all day today NASDAQ down 50 Russell down 19 and the Dow is a",
  "NASDAQ down 50 Russell down 19 and the Dow is a bucker of up 28 no real feeling to anything here but you can notice &ps have really gone nowhere the last two weeks sideways capitulation here with volatility hanging out at 1673 basically unchanged near the low end of its range you know what I like to do I always like to go to my high option volume list I like to click on these earnings and get rid of them so all of the stocks that I'm looking at here are stocks that do not have earnings a stock",
  "here are stocks that do not have earnings a stock that I've been looking at and watching is actually making new lows is Tesla down $18.70 uh Tesla ivx 5day change up a whopping 6% that's a big move over the last five days and Ivy rank is 46 Ivy rank expanding uh volatility expanding over the last five days even on the downside notice Tesla when it was going higher here uh this time frame from November to December how volatility was going higher and when Tesla's going lower take a look at it",
  "and when Tesla's going lower take a look at it here from July uh back in July of last year as it's going lower IV Rank and volatility also going lower but here we finally got a nice uptick in volatility even with the stock going lower to me that makes it sound like there's a little bit of capitulation so I've got a couple of trades for for you I got filled on one I'll see if I get filled on all three I'm a little bit light on trades today so I'm going to go with three trades in Tesla I've",
  "I'm going to go with three trades in Tesla I've gotten filled on one I'm going to show you the first one you might be able to do it a penny or two or three better than I did what do I do I like to go around I'm going to do a one by2 omnidirectional put ratio spread which is slightly bullish so I'm going to go with the 15 Delta I'm going to buy one of those that's the 280 puts and I'm going to sell two two of the 270 puts I was able to do this for $237 you have a mid price of 2.45 if you're",
  "for $237 you have a mid price of 2.45 if you're lucky enough to see it now when Tesla's down8 and change I was able to get filled right at Mid price or one penny below mid price plenty of liquidity here plenty of volume the world is your oyster this is a trade that has a minimal amount of Delta about eight eight long Deltas because your break even is below 260 260 uh is is is just $245 if that's where you get filled at 245 below $260 or around $257 is your break even right where that green line",
  "is your break even right where that green line ends you'll notice to the upside there's nothing uh that bothers you to the upside this trade does use about $7,200 in buying power it does have an almost 90% pop 89% pop it does have $13 a day in Theta Decay for that risk that you're taking of 7200 bucks does have a little bit of long Delta because I want lean a little bit long Delta after Tesla has gone down from oh I don't know let's just call it $420 or $430 to $330 down about $100 in the last",
  "$420 or $430 to $330 down about $100 in the last two weeks I'll nibble on Tesla why not what's another trade that I looked at that I did not get filled on yet hopefully I'll be able to get filled when I get off the show here um was a one by what was a another omnidirectional but slightly bullish trade here I like I want to do a jade lizard I'm going to go with a $10 wide Jade lizard I'm going to do the 355 calls I'm going to sell one of those and buy the 365 we like to collect around onethird",
  "buy the 365 we like to collect around onethird the width of the strikes this is a little bit shy of oneir the width of the strikes but I like the 67% pop so that would be the call spread to a jade lizard the Jade lizard has a naked put component to it what put am I looking to sell I'm going to go down to a put that gets to at at least $7 and change so I can go down to the 290s which would give me $10.10 or I can go up to the 295s that would give me around $11.30 I probably would up to the 295s",
  "me around $11.30 I probably would up to the 295s for $11.30 this trade would have a 76% pop not quite as a high a pop as the first trade I showed you um which is the 1X two ratio spread it uses approximately the same amount of money a little bit more because my put is closer $9,200 it does have 16 long Deltas but it does give you $24 in Theta Decay versus the $13 in Theta Decay that I showed you just a moment ago those would be that would be the second type of trade I might look to put on here",
  "second type of trade I might look to put on here I have not gotten filled on yet soon as I'm done with this podcast I will look to get filled on those two my La my my next one would be a just a straight strangle where can you go down to I found this interesting below a one standard deviation below the 15 Delta you can go all the way down to the 12 Delta that's the 270 put and I want to go up to the 435 calls just to give myself well I'm kind of I'm kind of really I don't know fooling myself a",
  "I'm kind of really I don't know fooling myself a little bit here by going with the one long Delta instead of going with the one short Delta if I go a little bit closer but I'm going to stick out here I'm going to go to the 435 calls and I'm I'm going to go to the 270 put trading for around $682 or so this is another trade that has an 80% pop $31 in Theta Decay versus the same $7,000 that I was doing on the 1 by two ratio spread but not quite the Delta risk that I have on the put ratio spread",
  "Delta risk that I have on the put ratio spread because you have risk to bolt sides on a strangle but we're well outside that one standard deviation matter of fact 435 you'd be back near the old highs on the lows on this strangle you're down to 270 plus the credit you receive which another $6 and change You' be you'd be going down to around uh I don't know it looks like around the the 26ish level where we fill in that Gap kind of where my break even is on the 1 by two put ratio spread those are",
  "is on the 1 by two put ratio spread those are my three trades not one not two but three trades that I've showed you today all in Tesla and you know what I'm going to do them all but you know what I need you to do I need you to open Move transfer bring your account to tasty trade do you know I know why well that's how we keep the lights on here and plus we keep all this content completely free for you and I appreciate your support for option trades today [Music]"
