all right so we're looking at my draftking strangle we'll go to the first slide here um this is just a look at the follow page so if you type in in the upper leand corner of the follow page there's a little symbol search bar you can type in the symbol you click on my little icon in the bottom you can pull up all my DraftKings trades or at least the last 30 is I think what we go back in any specific underlying so you can see all the adjustments here you can see like the price of the underlying the The Ivy rank um you know the action here which close or roll or if I'm you know buying the guts selling the wings which I did a couple times you can see all the credits debits doesn't really matter I don't want to focus too much on on the on the the profits and losses at each time it's really just the mechanics of that trade holding that position and having a position in that underlying for the entire calendar year it wasn't the same exact strikes we move strikes I scalped out of puts I scalped out of calls you know I traded the underlying through the whole year one contract with a very similar position throughout but it wasn't the exact same position every time it wasn't like I I kept those same strikes and we'll see that here on the next slide if we'll jump to slide two here this is the order chain so this is just on the platform if you have a tasty trade account uh tracks all the rolling and uh rolling and adjustments that you make on a position that are in the same transaction so it's really Nifty tool it adds up all your credits and debits to give you a net uh average trade price so that'll tell you you know how if you've collected a dollar over multiple roles you know what your basis is so to speak on your position whether it be the same strikes or a new position uh and then ultimately adds all that together so you can get a running total of your profit and loss so traditionally there's two buckets of p&l there's realized and unrealized and really when you close a position which a rolling position is part of a closing order you you're closing one position opening a new position opening a uh you know in a different expiration or the same expiration doesn't matter but they're two buckets so this basically combines your your realized p&l which is closed options with your unrealized p&l which is your o your open option position puts them together uh and totals them for you so you can keep a running track of your position so it was a great trade I mean on five or six or $700 in buying power to make nine or $922 is great but that's not really the the basis of this segment the basis of the segment was showing how you can take a position continue to roll it you know whether the stock goes up down sideways it doesn't matter you can keep collecting extrinsic value over time and that allows you to be you know to be in this situation of a nice profitable trade so you can check check those out uh your leisure will archive those of course uh with the tasty live on the tasty live.com site so getting over to the third slide here so one of the things I wanted to highlight because we always get the question of like which strike are you going to roll to or why did you pick that strike over this strike or how many Deltas are you are you trying to to get we always talk about reducing overall Delta exposure by 25 to 50% when you think about this from a one contract trade which I had for DraftKings the max I could get in terms of Delta exposure would be 100 if one of the options went deep in the money was basically all intrinsic value the max is 100 and you can see on each one of these adjustments on the top is the price of DraftKings at the time of each adjustment on the bottom is the net Delta change of each adjustment so if I'm rolling up a put it would show a long Delta and it would net out that that difference so if I'm buying a five Delta put and selling a 20 Delta put it would show us 15 Deltas in the that adjustment um and so the point is here that basically all of the adjustments that I did throughout this trade are somewhere between zero and 25 Delta adjustments right 5 10 15 20 Deltas most of those adjustments throughout the trade and that's because I'm always looking to reduce my overall Delta by 25 to 50% on a one contract trade I can only get to 100 the max Delta realistically unless there's some sort of tail event to either side is probably netting 70 or 80 Deltas in either direction and so rolling to pick up 20 Deltas long Deltas 20 short Deltas it doesn't matter um because I'm doing this dynamically with the price of the stock but picking up 20 Deltas is that at 25 to 50% reduction in My overall Delta so you can see that in all of the transactions here they're basically all like that now the ones that are sort of outliers on this I've highlighted in the blue there on the top with the blue circle there you can see these big moves in the underlying right so we went from in DraftKings in like the middle of June uh from 37 and a half all the way up to 45 okay that's a 20% or 25% move in the stock in the matter of two weeks three weeks at that point you have to pick up a you know you have to make that decision whether you want to reduce your Delta exposure by more or lean directional I took the the adjustment of Leaning a or of reducing the Delta a little bit more there rolling up and picking up 30 Deltas on my transaction same thing so we went from 45 and then a month in and change later we're trading at 32 so we went 3 37 to 45 to 32 so it's a 25% increase to a 30% drop in the stock price and those adjustments you have to make that decision of like whether you want to lean heavy directional and in terms of this position maybe 70 or 80 long Deltas or do you want to reduce that Delta and for me on this position most of the time I was trying to keep a little bit a little bit of delta in each way but reduce it with each of these roles yeah and there's always the question of like how you know if you had done nothing etc etc but that's the you you can't know where the stock is going to end up so you have to make these adjustments especially in a year-long trade where your number one goal is to just add extrinsic value to the position reduce intrinsic value exposure and You by when you do that you're reducing your Delta exposure as well so focusing on just compiling as much extrinsic value as possible taking where the stock price is out of the equation as much as you can you end up with at the end of the year a really wide Break Even range which will be uh shown in a couple slides here when we show you the visual yeah and I'm glad you mentioned the like you know why didn't you just do nothing because the that it's the hardest thing to do is that an option for you yes like you can make that decision you know what the stock has gone up significantly I want to lean a little bit short or the stock has gone down significantly I want to lean a little bit long that's totally fine for this position you know you don't know what's going to happen into the future and it goes to exactly what you said my goal is to collect premium I wasn't going to lean super directional in either in either uh in either spot when the stock moves so um it's hard to look back in hindsight and say oh well you know do nothing and it would been better you know when you keep when you take into account the you know emotional part of the game you know stock is down significantly you're losing money you got to do something to reduce the the you know that loss so it's you know you got to just kind of make the decision and as long as your size is in check even if it's the quote unquote bad decision or the worst time to do that you can hold that position long enough to you know to manage it through time and collect more extrinsic value so um let's jump back to the slides here and just go through the rest of the and all these metrics that you see all these visuals are from the order chains so if you rightclick on the order in the order chains on the tasty trade platform you can pull up the market snapshots which is where these are pulling from you can have them on your own trades is totally accessible for you as well um so so getting over to slide four here this just again a closer look at the Delta we talked through that every adjustment I'm picking up between 10 and 30 Deltas or 40 Deltas trying to reduce my overall Delta exposure for the position by 25 to 50% is a perfect example of that throughout the year jumping over to slide five we look at ivr so again you know this trade we had the idea of holding it the entire time so you know we didn't I could have closed the position through at multiple times while volatility was super low and just waited for volatility to to either get higher or move that Capital into something else we chose to keep this on for the year just to kind of keep this as a uh a year-long trade and just to show everything but uh you could see here all the adjustments that I did throughout the trade you know they're not all when volatility is super high like you have to make the decision of of reducing Delta even if volatility is low like sometimes you just the position gets too big you want to you know add extrinsic value so you know throughout the the duration of the trade volatility changes um you know which affects some of the credits that you see as well in the order chains if you look at the order chain slide you'll see a lot bigger meteor credits when volatility is High versus when it's low Y and that's especially true if you're rolling to at the money positions going from out of the money to at the money just maximizing extrinsic value uh and that's that eventually compiles to wide Break Even zones yes which is the most important thing yes jumping over to slide six here so this is a look at IV because this is another super important thing that we always talk about the actual implied volatility so we looked at IV Rank and IV rank tells one part of the story it tells you whether the current implied volatility which is what we're looking at now is high or low relative to itself over the last year so it gives you the context to know whether this number that that you see on the IV is high or low for this underlying now if I was doing those if I was trading in something that has normally you know 15 16 20% implied volatility and it gets to an ivy rank of five or 10 I won't be keeping a position on in there in something like DraftKings you can see the implied volatility just for contacts right now SPX the implied volatility is about 13 and a half% 13 to 14% in terms of the option price and the option premium in DraftKings it is about it's about four times as rich as what throughout the duration of this trade the whole year it's been about four times as Rich compared to SPX right now so when when you're looking at high implied volatility you you know my roles that were $1 if volatility was a 14 or 15 or 16 handle those would be 20 cents 25 cents so it's a huge huge difference and it's a huge difference in terms of the extrinsic value you collect how wide your break evens get how much wiggle room you have for the stock to move you'll see on the last slide that I've got this massive massive room you know range for the stock to move and so this is this is why we focus on high implied volatility underlyings and and talking about actual imp implied volatility not IV rank so the reason we focus on these high IV stocks is because we can withstand you know the stock went it started at 35 and went to 50 that's a 30% increase in the stock price almost almost 40% just doing rough math so it goes from 35 to 50 then it goes from 5050 down to 30 so it goes you know 40% up 40 50% down and then back up another 30% it basically settled you know five or six dollars higher from where we started the trade but that's that's implied volatility right and so you have realized implied or realized volatility in the underlying not many stocks go up 40% and then down 40% and then back up 30% you know that's volatility but you're getting paid to take that volatility and at the end of the day the stock stayed relatively sideways and that's why we were able to make so much on this trade because you're getting paid to take risk on this position you know multiples of what you would on something that is low implied volatility if you're in something that's got 14 or 15% implied volatility like SPX and SPX goes up 40% and then down 40% and up 30% there's no way you're making money on that trade via role like we did here or any other stock that's you know 14 15% implied volatility if you see that realized volatility you won't be profitable because the realized volatility is much higher than implied here the implied volatility was basically the same as the the realized volatility if you have 40% implied volatility or 50 or 60% implied volatility it's telling you that the stock can go up 60% or down 60% over the next year we you know it stayed inside that range but we had those points of realized volatility and so when you're selling High volatility you're getting paid to take that risk versus something that is low implied volatility you are relative to the the the potential you are not getting paid as much yeah another way to look at it now is like in DraftKings the December 19th 2025 cycle has a plusus $14 move so if the realized move in DraftKings is less than 14 points then implied volatility would have successfully overstated realized volatility yes in SPX the expected move through next year is 700 points so right now with SPX at 6,000 if we end up at 7,000 to the upside or if we end up at 5,000 to the downside then realized volatility would have exceeded implied and uh those are long-term expirations which don't really they they're not exhibiting the near-term implied volatility so it's even more like if you were to compound the 30 days 45 days there the premium that you would get would actually be more than in DraftKings a 14 point or in SPX a 700 Point move yes so that's that's another reason why we like to stick around that 30 45 day range because when it we're selling premium that's because we you'll always have a heightened implied volatility in the near-term Cycles relative to longer term Cycles you can look at a longer term cycle to see what the Baseline range is for implied volatility y yeah that's it's a great point and here you know even using current implied volatility in DraftKings of 40% you know we did this trade over the year 35 to right now it's trading at 44 is so it's been about a 30% move to the upside from start to finish just just you know price of the underlying we've we we've come in the realized volatility has come in less than what implied volatility is right now with draftking so if DraftKings does another 30% next year but volatility stays at 40 or 50% and you're selling premium you're going to make money over the year yeah I mean for the most part yeah you have a hard time not making money because those break evens over time you started with $2 and you ended up with a range that covered the whole screen yeah you're you're getting paid 40 uh points of volatility when volatility is only being realized at 30 points yeah that that's it that's that's why we look for high volatility underlyings um let's go back to the last slide just one one more second real quick too so one of the other things I wanted to show of just some of these adjustments you know going inverted buying the guts selling the wings you could see some of those in practice here a lot of people get spooked by going inverted it's all about extrinsic value it's all about selling volatility and and ideally having that realized volatility come in less than implied volatility it doesn't matter that some of my options were in you know my short calls were in the money at some points and my puts were in the money at some points it doesn't matter through all these roles you collect enough extrinsic value to offset those and roll those forward and this is just a perfect example of being able to you know take a positions that might be losing trades make them into winning trades I know this a year-long trade you hope not to be in that sort of trade uh on a losing trade but this is an example of just collecting premium and how how much you get paid for that for taking that risk on a you know eight or 10 cycle year which is what we looked at here yeah and if you stay in a trade this long your chart would look similar if you were to plot this yourself like the dotted green lines will always expand down and up to the right because you're collecting more premium you're compounding premium like what was you started with $200 strangle and what was your ending extrinsic value credit um like $1,100 something like that because I I clo I started the year the I got a 215 credit on the first trade uh and then I bought back my last trade at 244 debit so it's basically you know I basically just realized all the value I did throughout the year yeah all the credits I got from all the rolls buying the guts selling the wings you know I had some scalps in there of calls and puts you that's why some of the break evens break off there um but again I was you know trading what was happening yeah and my I started with a straddle so I started with $4 in premium and my total ending credit was $1,800 almost another version of what we talked about yesterday so yesterday if you missed it you can check out the archive for options trading Concepts live on tasty live.com uh we walked through Nick's year-long trade in DraftKings which started as a strangle and was manipulated couple of different ways throughout the year up down sideways by the guts s the wings yes lots of Trades I don't know I think it was like 20 some odd transactions so it's a lot yeah um I did a similar thing and we're going to walk through that today so let's pop right in and talk about it so just like Nick's setup you can search uh on the tasty trade follow page you can look at all of our adjustments from the beginning of the trade you can see at the bottom right of this uh image here the pop of 57% that indicates the opening trade the rest of the actions are roles and closes um but colle did tons of credit along the way before I ultimately closed the trade but open this trade uh for almost $4 started with the straddle and manipulated it throughout the year as the stock price moved the 35 strike yes indeed right at the money so you can see like there's the column the original column is the price at the time the now column is what it's trading on now so you know you did at the money straddle collected $4 now was was the start of the position yeah and that was uh I could have started with a strangle too I just wanted to start with the straddle because I wanted to maximize my extrinsic value credit received throughout the year and a straddle gives you more than a strangle um so and really there wasn't uh there wasn't any like skew to take advantage with the strangle in in DraftKings and that might be the difference for something like ibit where ibit you have significant call skew so in that case it might actually make sense to start with a strangle versus a straddle because you can get significantly further out of the money to the upside and not have that same uh issue to deal with for a deep in the money option y so with ibit for next year I think I actually might start with a strangle depending on where the stock is we'll we'll cross that bridge when we come to it in a couple weeks very nice if we go to the next slide here we can check out the order chains so uh you can look at your own order chains for different products this is a snapshot of my order chains uh and the way to read this is from the lower left up uh so lower left is the opening trade and you can see the 35 straddle for February manipulated it to a uh 35 straddle and then for just rolled it out from February 2 to February 16th for $2 kept rolling it kept rolling it then eventually went inverted to the 3841 one uh inversion rolled that out in time for $2 in premium rolled it out again for $2 in premium uh but adjusted the put strike up and then eventually I was at the 43 strike put you can see that little yellow uh symbol there where I was assigned on the 43 strike put so that was uh ultimately my decision to take the shares at 43 the stock had dropped significantly I had already collected a ton of premium and I knew that I could just lean long with the shares and continuously sell a covered call against those shares and that doesn't change the risk profile so Mike could have taken that put and rolled it out in time for a couple pennies or whatever the the the extrinsic value was at that time rather than do that you take the shares and you have that static Delta so it it doesn't you know it didn't change the position from a risk perspective all that much or at all I should say yeah from a downside risk perspective nothing changes it just like Nick said it gives you the static Delta to the upside so if this is a strong reversal I have no issue yes because I have the static shares against that short call where if you have a straddle and you get a huge move now you have upside risk yeah and well you have the extrinsic value that's at the money so you you if you're rolling a deep in the money option whether it's a call or a put and you're rolling that forward and you're collect in pennies you're not getting there's no time value to that option that you're getting paid if you get that big move however small probability it is that it happens in this case it actually did happen for you and it can happen of course but if you do get that big move your option that you've been rolling which was all intrinsic value is now going to be at the money and is going to hold both intrinsic and extrinsic value and that extrinsic value is against you because you have to buy that back and you've been rolling it for no extrinsic value along the way so at a certain point an option becomes all intrinsic value it is stock you might as well just have the stock rather than the option there's no difference between the two and that's where you were at that point you'll see that in the you know the graphic how far down the stock had moved that you were probably looking at pennies if that to roll that option yeah and really it's just just a matter of uh realizing that when you're selling premium you are collecting extrinsic value to take that risk if there's no extrinsic value to take the risk there's no reason to have the option you might as well have the shares that give you the static Delta and eliminate a lot of things that can go against you like Nick had said so that's what I did I took the shares at 43 but my basis on the shares was really at like 26 or 27 because I had collected so much extrinsic value along the way if I had just kept the shares at 43 and got rid of all the options I still keep all that extra insic value I collected along the way so $4 $2 a43 another $2 another $2 another dollar it's plenty of Premium my my basis would have been significantly below 43 but I knew that I could still sell that call Value which I did so I went to uh I actually rolled the 38 strike down to the $ 35 for a dollar and after that so I'm looking at the top of the second column here after that rolled up and out so we get the question a l a lot like if I have 100 shares of stock and I want to keep it what can I do rolling up and out is what we like to do and that just moves your extrinsic value from the near-term cycle at a lower strike to a further dated cycle at a higher strike and I did that for a 40 Cent credit so I basically gave my shares another $100 of profit potential moving from 35 to 36 and I also picked up 40 cents of credit yeah so that's what we like to do for trying to keep the shares and avoid having that short call go in the money and make sure that short call still has extrinsic value uh you can look up offensively rolling covered calls on tasty live and we have a segment where we talk about that exclusively um looking on the final right hand column here we I did the same thing just rolled out in time a couple times so I moved from October to November picked up a dollar mooved from November to December picked up a dollar and then eventually DraftKings was at like 43 44 the short call had no extrinsic value which again means the position is just done there's nothing else that I can get out of it I'm just holding risk so I closed the position and overall made uh $1,123 with the small gain in the shares or the value back in the shares I should say uh since I took the shares at 43 and I was selling premium below that level but I was able to do that because I had collected over $1,000 of extrinsic value so my basis was well below 43 knowing that I was able to sell below that 43 strike so as long as you have a ton of exic value you have a lot more flexibility of where you can sell premium below where you take shares in that case and that's because it's a high volatility underlying like you wouldn't have been able to do that in something that didn't have 40 50 60 70% implied volatility because you don't get paid you know you're rolling closer to to the stock to get that same dollar versus something like DraftKings where you can you know roll further out of the money on that short call yeah and let's say like in a different example let's say I had uh let's say I started with a 35 straddle for $4 and the stock tanked to like 15 I probably would have just taken the shares and just sat there and did nothing yeah CU like in that case unlike where I took the shares at 43 where I had already picked up a ton of Premium if you don't have a lot of Premium you can't really sell below where you take the shares or below your basis because your basis is so close to the stock price so if you have a lot of extrinsic value you have a lot more flexibility of selling below where you take the shares my break even was at again at like 27 28 so even even selling at 3536 I'm well above my break even even though I took the shares at 43 another thing I like out of your adjustments which I don't I don't know if you did totally on purpose but a lot of your roles are like around that 21 day Mark you were you were much more tasty mechanical than I was I was a little bit more like freehanded scalping calls and you know just kind of trading it yours was pretty like this this is an example of a trade that somebody that doesn't want to be in front of their computer all the time could just do I mean you have how many rolls or how many transactions 2 4 6 8 10 12 13 so you had one a month basically yeah I mean that's and you made 200% on you know from a return on Capital standpoint yeah and it they're not all going to be like this of course but this is like you know when people ask the question you know I don't have eight hours a day like we do to sit around and trade and like be involved in the markets can you really do this I mean this is a pretty perfect example yeah and it it also removes you from staring at the ticker all the time yeah you probably even care there were a lot of times where I forgot I was just like oh I should probably do something here yeah um but that comes with size that's you know size and having some understanding of what you're doing and and you know being a little flexible and being able to hold risk yeah too but especially with a short put like if you start with a short put and you just roll it perpetually like it's a very hands-off trade yeah high probability hands-off trade you could take shares that's the key you have to trade you have to have a size correctly where you can take the shares because that just eliminates so much headache and then you don't have to close a short putut like the like if I'm selling a put and I'm intending to close it if it goes in the money the short putut is not what I should be doing I should have a put spread yes because you can't like you can't take undefined risk and then change your mind once you actually get a position where you have the shares as a lower basis than where you were selling it in the first place so yes having the correct size allowed me to really do whatever I wanted in here and it it worked out in the sense of we were selling High implied volatility the entire year and the stock came in under the implied volatility of its projection yeah where uh which which doesn't it seems like if I told you a stock is up 30 or 40% that would be you know a tail Type move um you know the projection here was that this would could be up or down 50 60 70% yeah and so that's that's exactly what we play yeah DraftKings opened at 34 got as high as 49 got as low as 28 and it's currently sitting at 44 so it's up 10 points from the open on the year we were collecting premium reflecting a much bigger range yeah so I mean you collected $4 in premium a year ago yeah and it's only up $10 so I mean like that's that's a representation of lesser realized volatility than implied yep indeed uh if we continue on for the next couple slides we can look at the market snapshot so this can be seen on your order chains uh for any underlying you're analyzing just right click on any of the roles so like what we just showed prior just CL right click on any of those little snapshots and you can you'll find The View Market State snapshots it'll pop up for you so this is just uh a deeper analysis of some of the metrics of the trade so on the top we have Delta on the bottom we have stock price so again stock price went uh stock price was flying around through the entire year went as high as 50 went as low as 30 and you can see it's it's volatile it's not just like churning around 35 or 40 it it has had its moves and that's why you're getting paid premium to take risk in a product like this but my Delta really never got too crazy here uh that the line in in the top image that goes across is the zero Delta so you can see I kind of had like1 positive 10 it's nothing positive 50 at one point when it tanked yeah reduced it to 20 3010 10 so it's just like yeah I was pretty much except for that little blip in February where DraftKings uh retire it must have been like an earnings or something like that I mean in yeah February it went somewhere from you know the 40 handle all the way up to like 50 at the highs in like mid-march so somewhere around that is when you were probably you know moving some strikes yeah there picking up some long Delta roll that was probably when you rolled up to the 43 strike put yeah it was when I rolled from a 35 straddle to a 4138 inversion okay so yeah so I went from short Delta to positive Delta so that's where you're that's what we're seeing here yeah but the rest of them are same as what I was doing you know it's all you're picking up 10 15 20 maybe 30 Deltas you're not picking up 50 60 70 80 Deltas it's always an under hedge you're not you know you you're leaning even though you're making the contrarian adjustment to what's happening with the stock like the or a not contrarian adjustment I should say stock going up you're rolling up a put you're not you know fully buying there yeah you're adding a small you know 20 30 Deltas not a 50 70 80 Delta adjustment yeah and really it's it was always under hedging like Nick said I started with a 35 straddle eventually went from a 35 straddle to a 3841 inversion and that was when the stock was at 42 two so I went right at the money kept my inversion minimal at that point I had 4 6 7even I had 750 in premium and I had a $3 wide inversion perfectly fine y it's the same as having 350 in premium or 450 in premium on a 3841 regular strangle so plenty of excess extrinsic value relative to the inversion and then I just kept the inversion that same thing so I rolled out from April to May picked up another $2 so that brought me to like seven what was it four six seven $9 in premium on a a threo wide inversion so that's I think at some point I said like we're in a really good spot here and it's going to be hard for the stock to beat me now because I've I had like $1,100 in premium and I had eventually the 3843 inversion so big range for the stock to move uh for me to not make money on that trade in that cycle and then I just kept picking up more premium and it chopped around the same level y um if we go to the next slide we can look at some more metrics here we got Delta in isolation so again really hovered around that midline of zero Delta had my range of plus minus 30 Delta we'll call it except for that one adjustment where I moved the strikes at the top but you can see like every roll I made was kept me within 30 Deltas on either side of the market y bullish or bearish yes so that means I was focusing on extrinsic value focusing on time Decay IV contraction is associated with time Decay and uh you know not really taking too many big directional shots just making sure I had I was compiling extrinsic value and the more you do that the wider your break evens are which we will show at the end here with the visual uh on the next slide we can dive into implied volatility so IV rank in DraftKings has been pretty volatile it's gone from 10 20 to 40 around these earnings you're going to see these spikes so 40 60 90 these are all earning spikes but without the earnings we're still at 3040 IV rank which means implied volatility was in the middle of the range and it's moving that's another big thing is like there you you can you'll see in the IV chart it volatility swings around which is positive for you you want to be able to have that sort of movement because it allows you flexibility to you know roll and adjust positions you know when when that changes yeah so on the next slide we can look at the raw implied volatility so this is the implied volatility that you see on the right side of your expirations in the trading platform no nothing lower than 40% except for when I closed it yeah IV rank now is at Nega .1 which means we are setting the low in implied volatility for DraftKings for the year and it's under 40% for the first time so 40% 50% 60% IV is where we like to live that that's a good implied volatility number because it tells you that you're getting decent premium your buying power requirement is not going to be cash secured because it's not a huge IV product um which is why DraftKings is such a high return on Capital potential trade because you again you put up5 $600 for a strangle or straddle and you're picking up three four dollar to start the trade um so yeah nice range of implied volatility this is a a good example of the IV environment we want to be in so right now DraftKings is at 45% 40% IV and it's literally the lowest the lower bound of what we we're setting the lower bound now yeah of the entire year of DraftKings some equities which still have earnings still have CEOs still have boards they have earn of IV of 25% like or l or less those those are not good short premium envir ments because you still hold all the risk of these these equities but you're not getting paid to take the risk yeah if those stocks have the 30% move that we're experiencing in DraftKings you're losing five or $600 instead of something like DraftKings where it has a 30% move but it's projected to have a 50 or 60% move and you're making money that's why High volatility is is so important if you took the ticker out of the equation just looked at those two stocks and just said that they were two stocks that are going to perform with whatever the market does you'd want to sell premium in the higher volatility underlying because it allows you to to be potentially profitable on that sort of move y uh and last but not least our beautiful visual here and again the story Remains the Same literally all of our anatomy of a trades look like this where the Blue Line the stock price is flying around and our green dotted lines from the start of the trade to the end of the trade are expanding above the stock price and expanding below the stock price so my initial break evens when we started the trade was between let's say 38 32 and 48 right which makes sense 40 39 and 31 we'll say because I had a 35 straddle with $4 in premium look at the end the end I had a break even below 25 and above 54 let's say so for me to lose money at the end of the cycle DraftKings would have had to go up 50% in a couple weeks or get cut in half so that's the power of continuously collecting short premium and continuously staying in a trade the only way you can do that is if you're size small enough to do so and if you're in a decently High IV product that chops around or stays range bound this thing still moved but it didn't go crazy it didn't go from 35 to 100 or from 35 to 10 and never came back if you get a product that moves around but stays within the implied volatility this is what you're you're going to look like at the end of the year yeah even if you're making 20 adjustments 30 adjustments it's like as long as you're picking up credits and you're widening those break evens it makes it harder and harder for the stock to beat you because you've collected so much extrinsic value to offset intrinsic moves against you in that case it the it again it just all goes to implied volatility for this stock to be you assuming you're doing this for a year it would have to go up or down 80% because throughout the trade you're selling volatility that is projecting price movement over a year's time frame between 60 and 70% that was basically where we were at for all these adjustments so you need the stock to go up 80 90 100% or down 8090 or to zero to lose money on that sort of trade over a year's time in the short term over one or two or three months you might have a marked loss but that doesn't mean over a year you're going to still see that loss if you get you know that inside realized volatility inside relative to implied you get the 20% implied volatility stock and the stock moves 25 or 30% in either direction you lose money you get a 60% implied volatility and the stock moves 20 or 30 or 40% you make money that's the difference yeah and uh this was a great trade it was I knew it was going to be a great trade when I had the the 36 covered call and was just sitting there uh as long as the stock didn't tank because in this case I had no upside risk with my uh shares and my short call so looking at uh the difference here of like what I might have done if I knew I wasn't exiting the trade at the end of the year I probably would have uh rolled up and out more so like I knew I was exiting this trade at the end of this year but when I had the 36 strike short call against my shares when we were near 36 maybe I would have gone from the 36 to like January and moved it up to the 40 like right now you can still see if you if you've been doing that or if you have a DraftKings covered call at 45 like the the December 45 call you could buy back for a dollar if you had it moving it out to January or February you could move it up to the 49 so you could buy back the 45 in December move it to February 49 collect another dollar so like you can manipulate covered calls in that fashion that's an offensive covered call role um but yeah I knew I was going to be done with this trade so I didn't do that but any covered call position you can roll that short call up and out if that short call is at the money not completely in the money you can manipulate that extrinsic value and give yourself more offensive room to breathe for those shares but yeah it was a nice trade and uh we finally got one that didn't explode at the end of the year it's true yeah beautiful good job out of you
