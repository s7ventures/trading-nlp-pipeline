  "When a position gets away from you, consider closing it if it's not going your way. Aim to reduce Delta by at least 50% by rolling down the untested side. In a high implied volatility and good market, consider buying the guts and selling the wings to stay in the game. Don't keep playing a bad position just because of IV rank.",
  "In trading, high IV rank puts the game in a bad position. If IV rank drops, it's best to give up. It's frustrating when a stock drops significantly after managing a position, like on a Monday morning."
