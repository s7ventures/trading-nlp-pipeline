  "on Monday I got caught in a really bad position do you have guidelines for when to close a position that's gotten away from you or do you defend it until it comes back we're looking to roll down the untested side reduce Delta by at least 50% and play the game and we get to a straddle assuming that we still want to be in there with the high impli volatility and good Market we're looking to buy the guts and sell the wings it sucks you keep playing the game on a really bad position if the ivy rank",
  "the game on a really bad position if the ivy rank is high I fight it out even if it gets away from me the ivy rank drops pretty much give up it's the worst thing in all of trading is when you worked really hard to manage a position and then you get a crazy opening like Monday morning and some stock drops like 30% and you're just like the stock wins you can't defend it"
