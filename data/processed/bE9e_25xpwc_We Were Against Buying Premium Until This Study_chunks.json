  "this is a piece that a research team put together and when I was talking to Jacob and the research team about this he said you know because what happens is a lot of people send emails to our research team and when they do you know the guys they cue everything up and and you know and there's been a lot of questions over the years about mixing um buying premium and selling premium what happens when V gets low should you ever buy premium you know and we we pretty much are only sellers we don't",
  "and we we pretty much are only sellers we don't really buy but the question has come up is it okay to buy sure right sure I mean how many emails have you gotten on that topic uh so hundreds thousands right exactly throughout the years yeah yeah so Jacob and the team decided to Jacob is one of our um researchers and he's our kind of our math he is our math expert we have a couple of data scientists we have a physicist we have a bunch of really smart people but Jacob is the smartest math mind we",
  "people but Jacob is the smartest math mind we have and um and so he took an in-depth look at this and let's see what we got it's very interesting results a little surprising some mixed so at Tasty our research has led us to look for high probability trades this preference leads us to mostly choose short premium positions where we can theoretically get paid for taking um for agreeing to take on risk what what he means by that is we're agreeing to take a limited profitability for unlimited risk",
  "take a limited profitability for unlimited risk in return for high probability trade so but diversification is almost always good have the results for Traders who chose to sometimes purchase options rather than sell options have they differed at all let's take a look so we used 15 years worth of data we did the 20 Delta strangles and we looked at it from three different approaches always selling strangles always buying strangles and then combining the two okay following the shorts triangle",
  "the two okay following the shorts triangle winner with um um sorry following winning shorts triangles with another one but following losing shorts with a long strangle okay bat you got that okay okay so so this when you have a losing position following with a with a long strangle saying that maybe this thing's gotten away okay got it we managed all the position what you look at right yeah we managed all the positions when they reached 21 days we closed positions when they had a profit of um 50%",
  "closed positions when they had a profit of um 50% of Max profit okay so it's all fun and let's take a look at where we are it's all fun it's all games let's see until someone gets it in the face of course except Mike Tyson can't hit you in the face anymore we learned that that's true um so first we looked at spy and this is how we're going to set this up there's a lot of slides we're not going to go through every single one but but you can research them later on if you want um 21 days these are",
  "them later on if you want um 21 days these are 20 Delta strangles okay when you buy the strangle you you only win 27% of the time these are all IVs when you sell the strangle you win 73% of time that's very consistent but when you follow up you're losing short strangle with a long strangle at the same Delta you win the percentage doesn't drop off that much okay so long strangles on their own don't work long strangles following up a short strangle loss did work that's pretty interesting okay",
  "loss did work that's pretty interesting okay long strangles lost $21 over time over whatever this was 10 or 15 years yes short strangles made $21 that's that's our game but the combination of when you had a loser following up by a long strangle actually made money so that was good it doesn't happen that often but when it does it worked let's go next slide that was spy yep closing at 50% um I'm sorry that was spy with go back one side Beth for one sec that's closing at 21 days I'm sorry that's",
  "sec that's closing at 21 days I'm sorry that's 21 days closing at 50% the next slide should be very similar except in this case because you waited longer the um the long strangles actually did a little better the short strangles did a little better too um and the mixed it a little bit better but the long strangles still were net losers that's why you just can't go out and buy premium but if you bought premium after a losing trade the results were interesting here now remember that's a very",
  "were interesting here now remember that's a very small case there's not that many times but when it does it worked let's go next slide and when you did no management at all the only thing that worked was the shorts triangles so the mix trade only worked when there was management got it got it now if you go to the next one Beth we we just go through a bunch of these so we looked at iwm next and there results in iwm were very similar almost exactly the same as the Spy that's with at 21 days now",
  "the same as the Spy that's with at 21 days now if you go to the next one which is at 50% this was also um surprising uh the iwm shorts triangles worked at 21 at 21 days but 50% they didn't do as good and the mix worked go to the next slide this is no management at all and the mix lost the long strangles lost and the short strangles made a little tiny bit of money but nothing really the interesting thing here is that long strangles never work but buying a long strangle after a shorts triangle",
  "buying a long strangle after a shorts triangle failed actually worked a little bit let's go next slide it's kind of reversing the position I don't like it but the results were I mean we've had a market and I don't know if they're going to talk about it that's kind of gone in that direction I know this is a long period of time of of of uh data here but you need a continua market for this to work would you yeah you continuous yeah yeah yeah um if you go to the next side Beth and nobody knows of",
  "you go to the next side Beth and nobody knows of course yeah what's interesting here is that shorts triangles in the qes just haven't been that good um and it's funny because the q's are the only thing where a long strangle actually worked which really surprised me but that's because the crazy move we've had over the last you know 15 years and go to the last the next slide um this was surprising there have not been this has not been a good stretch for Q strangles now in my world if I back",
  "stretch for Q strangles now in my world if I back tested this this is when you probably want to put them on because they'll probably work from here right but Q's the only thing where a long strangle worked and a short strangle didn't the only thing now this is this is not taking into account ivr and one of the things that we do to modify this entire process is we only do this when ivr is high which which will yield completely different results but I want to bring this up because I think it's",
  "but I want to bring this up because I think it's important that you see everything you know and not and and we don't necessarily you know cherry-pick any of this um let's go to the next slide so these are really interesting takeaways across all major 3 ETFs in 15 years we saw noticeably improved results following a losing trade by taking the other side for the next cycle provided the positions were managed note that since short strangles are high pop trade this results in mostly selling premium",
  "pop trade this results in mostly selling premium but occasionally buying and these results are quite unexpected and require more in-depth analysis before making any significant strategic adjustments for now we begin to cautiously explore mixing some long premium positions after a losing trade on something that's like in a I guess you would say like in in it's having like some kind of an extended move it's still pretty mixed and I don't necessarily like flipping the cards over it's not part of",
  "like flipping the cards over it's not part of my style but the results were interesting the results were interesting definitely not part of my repertoire but they definitely interest them yeah"
