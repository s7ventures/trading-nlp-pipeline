  "A research team discussed the strategy of mixing buying and selling premium when volatility is low. They primarily focus on selling premium.",
  "are you ready to buy stocks? This question has been asked countless times. Jacob, our lead researcher and math expert, has analyzed this topic extensively.",
  "Jacob, our smartest math mind, conducted in-depth research on high probability trades at Tasty. Our preference is for short premium positions, where we get paid for taking on risk. This means agreeing to limited profitability for unlimited risk.",
  "Trading options involves taking on limited profitability in exchange for unlimited risk, but diversification is key. Analyzing 15 years of data on 20 Delta strangles, we compared the results of always selling strangles, always buying strangles, and a combination of both strategies.",
  "Following a winning shorts triangle, we entered another one. However, after a losing shorts position, we entered a long strangle. We manage all positions, closing them after 21 days or at a 50% profit.",
  "traders closed positions at a 50% profit. Let's review our current status with spy. There are many slides to explore for further research.",
  "When buying 20 Delta strangles, you win only 27% of the time. Selling the strangle results in a 73% win rate. Combining a short strangle loss with a long strangle at the same Delta maintains a high win percentage. Long strangles alone are not effective, but following up a short strangle loss with a long strangle is successful.",
  "Long strangles lost $21 over 10-15 years, while short strangles made $21. Combining a loser with a long strangle actually made money, which doesn't happen often but worked in this case. Moving on to the next slide, focusing on closing at 50% in 21 days.",
  "SEC closing at 21 days, 50% gain. Long strangles performed better after waiting longer, short strangles also improved slightly. Mixed results overall, long strangles still lost. Buying premium after a losing trade yielded interesting results.",
  "In trading, it is important to remember that small cases may not occur frequently, but when they do, it can be profitable. Effective management is key, as shown by the success of short triangles. Results in trading IWM were similar to SPY, both showing success at 21 days.",
  "The Spy at 21 days performed the same as the one at 50%. The IWM shorts triangles were successful at 21 days but not as much at 50%. The mix of strategies worked better. Without management, the mix lost money, with long strangles failing and short strangles making a small profit. Long strangles typically do not work well.",
  "Buying a long strangle after a short strangle failed worked a little. The results were positive in a market that has been moving in that direction. A continuous market is needed for this strategy to work effectively.",
  "Beth, the shorts triangles in the QEs haven't been successful. Surprisingly, a long strangle worked due to recent market volatility. However, Q strangles have not been profitable recently.",
  "important to consider the impact of implied volatility on strangle strategies. In my experience, long strangles have been more successful with Q, while short strangles have not performed as well. It's worth noting that high IVR can significantly affect the outcome of these strategies.",
  "It's important to consider all information when trading. In the past 15 years, major ETFs have shown improved results after a losing trade by taking the other side in the next cycle, as long as positions were managed properly. Short strangles, being a high probability of profit trade, mostly involve selling premium.",
  "Pop trade involves mostly selling premium, but occasionally buying. These results are unexpected and require further analysis before making strategic adjustments. We are cautiously exploring mixing in some long premium positions after a losing trade on an asset experiencing an extended move.",
  "Flipping the cards over is not my usual style, but the results were interesting. It's not part of my repertoire, but it definitely caught their interest."
