  "Profit targets for Delta zero DT options are crucial for success in high-speed trading. Our research team analyzed 18 months of data and found that selecting the right profit target is key. We looked at various strategies, including selling 50 Delta strangles and straddles, to determine the most effective approach.",
  "Straddles sell both far out of the money 10 Delta strikes. In this study, hypothetical traders were considered who would leave losing positions alone and close winners using profit targets from 10 to 45% of the credit. All trades were assumed to exercise or close at the mid price.",
  "The mid price is fair, requiring a small adjustment of a nickel or dime. Subtract $1 to $15 from daily P&L values to adjust for buying power. Adjust long strikes for realistic results based on capital committed to zero DT positions. If buying wings for capital reasons, subtract $10 to $15 daily. Focus on the most and least favorable scenarios.",
  "We analyzed the worst 5% of outcomes, the average time to close trades, and the percentage of profitable trades. Let's focus on straddles, which involve selling at-the-money puts and calls.",
  "The average time to exit for selling on the opening is 10:06 am with a 90% win rate. You can make $60 on average by exiting at 10:06. For a 15% profit target of $116, exit at 10:37 with an 87% success rate. For a profit target of $117, exit at 11:08 with an 84% success rate.",
  "At 84% $117, getting out at 1108. After 1108, everything goes downhill. When selling straddles, you have only an hour to two and a half hours. Moving on to strangles, you can expect a similar timeframe.",
  "We achieved a 93% success rate with a 20% profit target at 9:51 am, an hour and a half after opening. The best profit and loss was at 10:40 am, two hours after opening. The key takeaway is that zero DTE trading opportunities typically last between an hour and two hours for high probability success.",
  "key is to recognize when the trade is no longer working and exit early to minimize losses.",
  "targets are much more achievable and allow for quicker exits, avoiding larger losses. It can be difficult to cut losses early, but sticking to the 10% profit targets can help improve overall trading success.",
  "The 25 Delta strangle did not hit the 10% profit target, but the other trades were successful. It is important to exit early within the first hour and a half. Moving forward, we will focus on the 20 Delta strangles within a two-hour trading window until around 10:30.",
  "This is our two-hour trading window. I prefer to trade when the VIX is high for a better edge. Moving on to 15 Delta strangles, there is not much profit potential. The win rate is high but losses can eat into profits. The win rate is in the 90s.",
  "Win rates in the 90s show that close-to-the-money positions perform best when closed. Short options reaching 20% of max profit with short strikes between 35 Delta to 20 Delta. 25 to 30% profit targets are better. It is important to be willing to exit rapidly. Well-performing traders tend to exit winning positions between 10 and 11:00 a.m. Central Time. Riskier strikes benefit from safer strategies.",
  "Time the riskier strikes benefited from safer management while higher pop short strikes were better off being allowed to run slightly longer to collect a larger portion of a smaller credit. Depending on the strikes you select, set your expectations around making less money selling further out of the money options but taking less risk."
