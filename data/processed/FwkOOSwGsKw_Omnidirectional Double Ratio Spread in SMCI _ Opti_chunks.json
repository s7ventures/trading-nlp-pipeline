  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the bat batist and I have a trade idea for you today December 5th 2024 but before like we always do let's take a quick look at the market see what's going on entps down four handles very tight range overnight of only 10 handles that's top to bottom meaning the low to the high of the Emin snps was only 10 points you can see now it's about 14 and a half points just trying to show you that's relatively tight range relatively tight range to the market but",
  "range relatively tight range to the market but there are plenty of stocks U moving uh today so we'll take a look at those in just a minute NASDAQ down 20 just not a lot of action overnight into the morning Russell down 15 and the Dow down 100 everything was a little bit green this morning it's turned a little bit South so far uh later in the morning volatility which was lower 1455 a newish low uh in volatility back to 1470 I don't put too much weight in that volatility kind of going sideways",
  "weight in that volatility kind of going sideways here at 1470 bonds are down seven ticks like I always do I like to come here and go to our watch list I have the high option volume list but you know there are many list there's even a bat watch list if you want to look at the stocks uh and Futures mostly that I look at that's this list right here on the leftand side that I keep on mind there's also a Tom list I think he's down at the bottom right we like to put Tom at the bottom because cream",
  "we like to put Tom at the bottom because cream Rises to the top that's why you're watching the bat and the bat watch list is higher than the Tom watch list but there are many things to look at crypto the crypto products that we have dividend Aristocrats if you like one of those people that likes to trade dividends earnings all earnings tasty earnings more liquid all the Futures here's your market indicators here's your high option volume list that's where I am right now but there's many many",
  "that's where I am right now but there's many many many more market indicators that you can look at okay so I'm going to go to the high option volume list I'm going just going to put the stock up there for you that I found we're going into smci yes I know smci has been in the news lately it's had a lot of movement here all the way down into the teens because of some accounting irregularities call it what you may stock has rallied back to 41 and change volatility or Ivy rank Staying High at",
  "and change volatility or Ivy rank Staying High at around 42 here in SMC High obviously not as high as it was when Ivy rank was in the 60s and 70s when the stock was much lower here a nice equilibrium higher than it normally is after earnings after earnings usually goes down into the 20s it's about twice as high as it normally is but of course it's high for a reason there's always something going on let's go back to that list here for a minute um let's try to find smci here it is right now",
  "um let's try to find smci here it is right now you'll notice smci Ivy ranked down 11% over the last five days that's a huge move to the downside not typically what I want to see and why I'm going to do both sides here and I'm going to do both sides not in a strangle form although what I'm putting on does have a synthetic strangle to it but it's something that has a little bit more um more oomph to it uh a Batwing trade I'll show you that in just a moment um Ivy rank of 42 when you look at all",
  "a moment um Ivy rank of 42 when you look at all the ivy ranks that don't have earnings I click off earnings here you'll notice that a lot of these stocks don't have anything that's in the 40s the first one is boil and I don't know boil you don't really want to trade that's a triple leverag um natural gas product in my mind uh very very hard to make any money in there it really does move a directional trade if you're going to do anything in there very hard to sell premium there but you'll notice",
  "very hard to sell premium there but you'll notice none of these without earnings has a ivy rank over 40 that's worth trading here's an $8 stock the first one that you're really going to find is s smci let's take a look at that right now there it is at 42.6 Ivy rank is down over the last 5 Days by 11 so maybe it's a trade that you want to look at and not possibly put on we would love this number to be green when we put on any type of volatility trade let's go in there and see what we're going to",
  "let's go in there and see what we're going to do January options 43 days to go you want to stay in the most liquid ones 45 days is the most uh is optimal 43 days is close enough in the weekly options um the stock has had some good movement uh I want to show you something here I'm going to do an omnidirectional slightly well well let's see what the Delta is you tell me what what direction you want the stock to go in it's a double ratio spread or batwing trade like I like to call it I'll show you",
  "trade like I like to call it I'll show you why in just a quick moment uh but here's what I'm doing I'm going out to around the 20ish Delta option I'm going to buy the 62 call one time I'm going to sell two of the 65 calls that's a 1 by two ratio spread trading for $117 now I want to show you a couple of things before I show you the other side look at where we are on the 20 Delta we're over a standard deviation move to the upside that's because there's a lot of call skew when I do the put sprad",
  "a lot of call skew when I do the put sprad here in a moment you'll notice that my credit is not going to be as high and I'm also going to be uh closer to at the money stocks 41 we're at 60 to we're almost $20 uh outside or away from um where the stock is good Standalone trade if you're looking to collect a $117 in credit for $1,200 worth of risk Max profit $417 that's because this spread is $3 wide if we closed right at 65 which is unlikely at expiration you still had this on a lot of ifs ifs",
  "expiration you still had this on a lot of ifs ifs ifs there you could make $3 on this trade plus the $117 that you sold it for is $4.7 C this would be a short Delta play even though your max profit is up at 65 which is 23 or $24 higher than where smci is today $5 a day in Theta Decay 91% pop now since I'm going to have risk to both sides you could take a look here I think it's a nice little learning uh uh example here your probably profit is actually going to go down because even though you're",
  "going to go down because even though you're collecting more credit this number will go up or this Max profit will go up um even though you're collecting more credit you have risk to both sides instead of one side your Theta is also going to go up your Delta is going to go down so you're going to have less short Delta on here your buying power is going to stay about the same maybe actually even go down a little bit so let's see what I'm going to do here so on the other side I'm going to keep it",
  "do here so on the other side I'm going to keep it pretty simple I'm going to go to the same 20ish Delta option I'm going to go to the 32 puts I put this on the stock was about 50 cents lower than where it is right now I'm going to buy the 32 puts one time and I'm going to sell two of the 29 puts now we were getting around a dollar uh 17 you now can get A1 uh 89 as a mid price now I got filled at a185 I had to go in about two or three cents below mid price now maybe with the stock rallying a",
  "mid price now maybe with the stock rallying a little bit maybe volatility is percolating a little bit maybe you get a little bit more than this I would be really surprised even though the markets are fairly tight that you get filled at Mid price in smci so here's what I do when I put this trade on I just watched it for this few seconds I go in at 192 I don't get filled I cancel replace I go in at 191 I go in at 190 I go in at 189 I go in at 188 I go down to 187 and I probably sit there if the",
  "I go down to 187 and I probably sit there if the mid price was 189 like it is right now that's how I get filled uh that's how I trade my orders I get I got filled at a185 you certainly can get filled uh it looks like you get filled better than I did on this trade it has a 76% pop just like I predicted your pop would go down because you're getting uh more uh you have risk to both sides um our credit received went up your Theta went up it almost doubled which is awesome uh when you're selling",
  "doubled which is awesome uh when you're selling premium you want a high Theta Decay still have a high probability of profit you want a high probability profit you know over 65% your Delta went down from 15 to just about eight or so or 14 to 8 your max profit went up ever so slightly I told you it would go higher and it did uh goes Higher by the amount of credit you received remember we got about a15 or so on the on the call spread you're only getting about 70 cents on the put spread um again",
  "getting about 70 cents on the put spread um again whether you whether you're if you're bearish on smci I probably only do the one side the call spread if you're bullish I would probably move these up a couple of strikes and try to collect a little bit more credit your buying power went down to 1356 as I had predict predicted but I still like this why did I I mean I like this trade I like the buying I like all those Greek that went up there I wish I was getting filled where you're getting filled",
  "I was getting filled where you're getting filled closer to $190 and15 you win ladies and gentlemen I call this the bat uh trade uh let's take a look or bat wing trade when you put the trade in or you have the trade on in your account you'll see that there's a nice little tent up here um at the at around the 66 is level to the upside it makes a thing that looks like a Batwing and you'll have another one to the downside down here where it makes a little batwing uh going higher so you'll check",
  "a little batwing uh going higher so you'll check that out all right ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for giving me your time here today you know what I need you to do I need you to do one more favor please open Move transfer bring your account to tasty trade the number one brokerage firm of the Galaxy they giving away money too if you bring your account so please bring your account bring all your positions if you want to uh they they transfer in kind obviously cash tra travels a lot",
