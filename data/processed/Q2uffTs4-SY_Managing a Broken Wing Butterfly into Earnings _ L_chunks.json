  "welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video I'm going to show you how to turn a broken wi butterfly into a risk-free [Music] butterfly Tesla okay big move today I'm looking at broken wing butterfly on the upside here on the call side do this for a small credit plays up to about the 295 level which is basically the highs that we've seen 265 is my first long strike I'm selling two of",
  "265 is my first long strike I'm selling two of the 280s and I'm buying one of the 305 so it's a 15 by 25 long to short spread so you have $1,000 in Max risk here um small 37 Cent credit so you have no risk to the downside but really just playing for like you know a little bit of a v Crush maybe a little Bounce from here see what happens [Music] Tesla has fallen out of bed over the last couple weeks here uh we put on a butterfly on the second so uh just to give you an idea of where the price was",
  "just to give you an idea of where the price was it was about 243 A5 uh when we traded this originally the stock is now 219 and change so it's down about 20 points we had a wide butterfly we're using a little bit more Capital than we usually do we were long the 265 short two of the 280s long one of the 305s so we're 15 points wide on the long spread on the short spread we 25 points wide so we were using about $1,000 in buying power we did this at a 37 C Credit it's actually marked right now at",
  "a 37 C Credit it's actually marked right now at about a 30 C Credit as well to close this position and the reason that is is because these far this far out of the- money call spread has gotten so cheap this long option is actually holding a little bit of value so this is a rare case or I shouldn't say rare case but one of the cases with a broken wing butterfly is when you enter the trade you can do it for a credit and you can also close it for a credit and that that is possible because of that",
  "credit and that that is possible because of that closer at the money long spread that holds some sort of value relative to that that wider out of the money short spread which loses a lot of value so that's one thing we could do we could close this out for another 30 Cent credit or so and take $66 in profit or 65 depending on where we get filled on this position one of the interesting things here is that we do have earnings coming up so the earnings are on the 23rd here so just a couple days",
  "are on the 23rd here so just a couple days from now um and into that earnings you obviously have heightened implied volatility you big potential moves especially in a stock like Tesla you can see some wide price action in Tesla so we can actually buy in this risk and give ourselves a little bit of a shot at some added profit if something wild were to happen so from other broken wing butterflies and ratio spreads that we've done before the way that you would do this would be to buy in the risk",
  "you would do this would be to buy in the risk so if you remember 15 points wide on the long spread that means and we can actually see this on the analysis mode here so we'll go to the ad expiration toggle this on and zoom out a little bit so you can see my risk is right up at about 95 right because I have that 15 point yde long spread my Max profit would be you know a big $1,500 profit obviously a low probability of that happening if we do get right up to 275 and change uh but my risk is here",
  "right up to 275 and change uh but my risk is here at 295 so if I can buy in my risk to 295 meaning sell out of this 305 and buy this 295 I'll free up all that Capital that I'm using the th000 in capital and I'll essentially have this butterfly on this equal with butterfly the 265 280 295 I'll have it on for a very um uh for a pretty decent credit actually I mean when you think about it about 15 20 cent credit net credit on the position with a shot at up to $1,500 now when you quantify this shot",
  "at up to $1,500 now when you quantify this shot let's just get filled just to get this uh get this on the board here we'll try and get filled at 14 cents let's try 15 all right so we got filled at 15 cents so you can see my average trade price 22 cents so I've locked in 22 cents of profit that is on the table that's mine I'm keeping that I freed up all the capital so I'm not using any Capital to hold this position now the stock is trading all the way down here 220 so it's a very low probability",
  "way down here 220 so it's a very low probability of actually hitting this but how can we actually quantify the probability so when you look at the position you can actually use the probability of touch but if you want and that that is toggled here um but if you want to do just kind of a back of theand Traders a Trader hack for probability of touch on a strike you just take twice the Delta right so you double the Delta a Delta of 11 would give you somewhere around a 20 or 22% probability of",
  "you somewhere around a 20 or 22% probability of touching 265 in the next 25 days at some point within that duration so it gives you about a 20ish % probability of reaching some sort of added value on this position right now it's trading at 44 C so if I were to close this position I would I would take 44 cents in credit or around that if I got filled there uh I'm leaving that on the table in exchange for up to $1,500 in potential profit at a 20% or so probably less uh probability of actually",
  "or so probably less uh probability of actually hitting any of that profit so I'm leaving that on into earnings the stock has been flying around uh 265 is Within Reach of where we were just a couple weeks ago so hopefully we get a little bit of a pop on earnings the stock gets somewhere to like 240 250 and I'll get hopefully about a dollar or two out of this position so I'm risking 40 cents for a two or3 potential profit at about a 20% probability so uh a long shot but a shot we're willing to",
  "so uh a long shot but a shot we're willing to take for a little Johnny account to make some big [Music] bucks all right time to close one of our more interesting positions our Tesla broken wi butterfly we turned into a risk-free butterfly gave us a shot into earnings here Tesla just reported earnings yesterday after the close $36 move I think it was probably two or three times the expected move here into earnings if I'm if if I remember correctly the expected move was somewhere around $4 or $15",
  "the expected move was somewhere around $4 or $15 so it's definitely exceeded the expected move here into earnings we're now back to where we're Trad where we were when we started this position you've had the benefit of some time Decay and you also bought in that risk so just to to um see what that uh profit was or that added value that came from buying in that risk it actually netted us another 70 cents because we did this trade at 15 cents so uh or about 65 cents is our net on that position 60",
  "or about 65 cents is our net on that position 60 to 65 cents so we've got this equal with butterfly now the question becomes a million-dollar question is do you hold this position or close it and to be completely honest the answer is totally subjective now I have no principal risk on this trade I've booked 22 cents in profit covers all the commissions fees all the other stuff uh that some of the people in the chat get uh excited about but for me in such an extreme move my thought is that you",
  "me in such an extreme move my thought is that you know what I take the profits I take the money and run I've added into this move $160 of value is basically trading at at you know pennies before the earnings so I basically got all of this overnight and for me I think I take the profits here it worked out perfectly if you wanted to hold this and take the shot into the next 22 days uh until expiration totally just justifiable and and your risk moving forward is just the profits you have on the",
  "forward is just the profits you have on the table so you have to keep in mind you have no principal risk left in the trade you can't lose anything you you put out originally as risk but you have 180 some odd dollars in value that's sitting on the table that you are risking through the rest of the duration if this stays out of the money so for me I'm always looking to take profits somewhere between $50 and $200 on most my trades this is the higher end of my trades uh in terms of profits I'm",
  "end of my trades uh in terms of profits I'm ready to take the money and run move on to something new we can even do something in Tesla into the future so to Route this order uh you'd be buying or you'd be selling out of the 265 buying two of the 280s and then selling out of the 295 you can see we we've got a mid price it's probably about 20 to 30 cents wide here depending on where we get filled um and you know the spreads are moving around with the stock moving a little bit as well let's see if",
  "stock moving a little bit as well let's see if we can get into even 160 and we we'll work our way down from there we'll go to 158 all right so we closed that we actually got price improved on that order to 159 so we ended up closing out of that butterfly we we started with the broker wing butterfly 37 we bought in the risk at 15 cents and then we closed today for a credit of $159 which Nets us $181 on this trade uh in just about 20 or so days 21 days so a nice little trade here in the books",
  "21 days so a nice little trade here in the books earnings were perfect for us they bailed us out they got us extra profits on that trade so it's a perfect uh execution there we'll see if we can get some more into the future if you want to catch these trades live tune in to Johnny trades every Wednesday at 9:40 a.m. on tasty live peace [Music]"
