  "what do you think about buying a leap following a 5 or 10% fall in the market I think if you did it in 2024 if we had a 5% fall in the market it would have worked out great because we closed on Market highs I mean what do I think of it it's not something that I do I think the markets are too wide typically in the leaps but I have no problem with it again you know if you're bullish and that's what you want to do sure I have no issue with it it works beautifully for the last 15 years I don't do",
  "beautifully for the last 15 years I don't do this Tony doesn't do this L we think a stock is really beaten up there's no point in last 15 years where this hasn't worked that's something important to lean on we don't do this"
