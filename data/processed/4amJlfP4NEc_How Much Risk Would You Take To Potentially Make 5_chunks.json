  "So today we're going to talk about how buying power reduction BPR reflects option trading risk now the simplest way to to Define this option buying power basically is your risk right there's no other thank you this segment is now over sponsored by the CB we're all done you take your option buying power and that is the cleanest definition of risk that there is because what could be more accurate than what you're required to put up to make the trade yes exactly I side how much how much risk do you",
  "yes exactly I side how much how much risk do you think we're willing to take to make 50 cents right basically you know whatever that's the that's the model that's the model so BPR buy Power reduction refers to the capital requirement that a trade must maintain when holding certain positions in their brokerage account naked option strategies may require higher capital or more buy power to cover the potential losses in case the trade moves against you it's essential to fully understand the risk",
  "you it's essential to fully understand the risk associated with trading options and BPR is a good measure of helping you to maintain sufficient Capital we threw it up on the screen the BPR formula for naked options and again th this is it's it's usually less than 20% but 20% is the number that we go with the underlying price plays the most important role in calculating BPR followed by the added money value followed by the option premium in this case it's 20% of the underlying price you know",
  "case it's 20% of the underlying price you know minus the out of- the money Value Plus the option premium it usually comes in somewhere between 15 and 177% on naked option strategies there's a couple different ways to get to a minimum number but that's how it works the rule of thumb that we use is about 20% but it's always less than that the study we use spy data we looked at naked positions in the Spy we looked at naked short puts naked short calls we recorded the effect of the underlying price",
  "we recorded the effect of the underlying price the out- of the money value the option premium um on VPR with each strategy and we use this information that we learned above to figure out the BPR requirements for different strangles now remember a tasty you're allowed to use any strategy regardless of account type even in an IRA and stuff like that the difference is in an IRA you can't borrow you can't everything has to be cash secured there's no borrowing money and so everything has to be cash",
  "borrowing money and so everything has to be cash secured and for the firm because there's no you never borrow money to trade options you just have to have enough money to cover the risk so we make it essentially the synthetic cash security all that means is you never borrow money ever to trade options or futures only borrow money potentially to to trade stock if you don't trade stock you're never ever going to borrow any money the difference is you have to put up a certain amount of money to",
  "you have to put up a certain amount of money to cover the risk on your option trades that's BPR and in an IRA account you have to put up pretty much the cash secured risk yeah a lot of people will mistake it like they'll say how much is the margin for that trade and even you know I'll say it sometime times you know instead of saying what's not margin right it's not margin there's no borrowing let's go next slide so this slide we looked at um naked short puts and we looked at 16 Delta the the 50",
  "short puts and we looked at 16 Delta the the 50 Delta which is at the money so we looked at out of the money at the money and then in the money short puts you know and and you can see the difference is is pretty small between doing an out of the money and an at the money and an in the money it's not that dramatic a difference you go from 10,900 to 11,400 and the reason it's so expensive right now in the Spy is only because the Spy is so expensive right right that's it um and let's see what the",
  "right right that's it um and let's see what the team wrote here yeah I mean underlying price plays a majority of the role in buying power out of- the money value only comes into play for out of the money options and the 50 and 70 Delta puts don't have any out of the money value so that's why they're virtually the same let's go to next Slide the point for this slide was just showing you that it doesn't make much of a difference whether it's in the money or out of the money so when we do out of",
  "money or out of the money so when we do out of the money calls or I'm sorry we do naked calls in the Spy it's it's it's going to be very close to the same thing a 16 Delta call 10,900 just like it was for the put and the in the money 11,400 at the money 11,400 in the money 11,400 same exact thing there's no difference basically for a put and call so you sell them both you only have to put up one you know only have to put up the same amount of money but you get double the premium that's why we",
  "but you get double the premium that's why we do strangles instead because you don't know which way the Market's going to go anyway here's the 16 Delta strangle and since we don't sell you know at the money straddles very often we're not going to sell an in the money um strangle or straddle so we're going to look at the 16 Delta strangle and the buying power you can see on the put side on the call side and on the strangle side they're all the same so when people go why do you sell both here",
  "same so when people go why do you sell both here that's the reason because you get twice the premium for the same amount of money the buying power for a strangle is based on the side that has the higher buying power since you can't be margin on both sides both positions can't be out of the money so you pay just that one amount for the same Delta on putting call options the call strike is much closer to the stock price compared to put but regardless the number comes out to be the same um",
  "regardless the number comes out to be the same um sometimes there's a little bit higher number on the call side than the put side if there's call skew but in in this particular product there's not I think that there's nothing on these slides bat that would surprise anybody but just the the sheer number of the sheer number here of just being 10,000 $1,000 to sell a strangle in in the SP W just is a lot yes that's all that's the challenging part you know it used to be used to be 5,000 now it's",
  "you know it used to be used to be 5,000 now it's 10,000 11,000 it's just based on price as the price got bigger the the buying power got bigger so the buying power reduction is an important metric to measure risk on a trade it is the risk essentially that's how we look at it it is the risk this the underlying price pays the largest role in buying power and then comes other things like out of the money value and everything else but the difference between in the money at the money out of the",
  "between in the money at the money out of the money it's all going to be very close to being the same thing in strangles the same Delta put in call options um more money should be allocated towards adjusting the call side and losing position because it's more likely get heard on the call side and the only reason they're saying that is because more things go up than down you know well H it has in the last yeah yeah 20 years yes yes for sure but the point of the the discussion today is just so you",
  "point of the the discussion today is just so you understand that that first of all you can't borrow money to trade derivatives options or futures or Futures options only stocks B so there is no margin but you need a margin account to trade it that's just the that's the reg those are regulatory Rules by power reduction reflects your risk very accurately and put and call are naked are going to be basically the same as the strangle"
