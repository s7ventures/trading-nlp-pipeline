  "implied volatility and strike distance play a key role in options trading. Selling options when IB is higher can lead to better performance. By analyzing the distribution of the VIX over the past 20 years, we can see that as a premium seller, we collect richer premiums when implied volatility is elevated. Categorizing trades based on VIX into four groups can help us make more informed decisions.",
  "the strike prices also increase, resulting in higher potential profits but also higher risk. Conversely, when the VIX decreases, the strike prices are closer together, leading to lower potential profits but also lower risk. It is important to consider the VIX levels when selecting strike prices for trading strategies.",
  "the VIX increases above 22, the distances between option strikes and the underlying price expand rapidly. The credit received as a percentage of the stock price also increases significantly, pushing the strikes further apart. This results in both put and call options doubling in distance compared to when the VIX is at 13.",
  "When the VIX is high, around 20, there is potential for a good credit spread trade. Aim for a range of 16 to 22 for a 7% difference on the put side and 6% on the call side. The credit received is significant in this range, making it an ideal sweet spot for trading.",
  "want to focus on trading in a spot between 16 and 22. Going over 22 can be more profitable, but avoid going over 35 or 40 due to increased uncertainty and volatility. Higher volatility in markets, especially when the VIX is between 16 and 22, may result in slightly lower win rates. However, wider strikes in high IV environments lead to better performance in terms of return on capital.",
  "RLC shows a win rate of 76% with an average return on capital and credit percent of price remaining high. Despite a slightly lower win rate, the return on capital increases, compensating for the extra risk.",
  "Option premium is higher in markets with elevated IV, resulting in wider distances between strikes and the underlying price. This makes it easier to manage the portfolio and avoid situations where strike selection is too close to the underlying price.",
  "selecting strikes too close to the current stock price can be challenging. However, premium sellers can benefit from improved success rates and returns on capital. Despite the theoretical probability of profit remaining the same, having higher implied volatility can be advantageous.",
  "Higher implied volatility creates a better trading environment, despite the increased risk. This risk is offset by a higher return on capital and a high win rate."
