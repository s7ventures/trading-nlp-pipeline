  "over the course of the next 45 minutes we are going to completely change the way that you view the markets and get you ready to start trading volatility not necessarily Direction I'm Jim Schultz Finance phg I've been trading for nearly 20 years now and trading volatility specifically through options for almost 10 now naturally let's begin by addressing the elephant in the room if you're bullish and the market goes up things are going to work out pretty well if you're bearish and the market goes",
  "pretty well if you're bearish and the market goes down things are going to work out pretty well like you're going to make money so don't get me wrong direction matters and during the times when you're able to actually nail the directional move things work out pretty well and they're pretty easy the problem is no one really knows where the market is going next not me not you not anybody you might have a hunch you might have a feeling that this stock is going this way or this Market is going that",
  "is going this way or this Market is going that way and so by all means you know do that follow those hunches we all do that I do that you should do that but the important thing to do is just put it in its place understand what it really is in the sea of Randomness that is the short-term directional moves in the market what I want to do in this crash course is I want to show you how you can take the emphasis off of something like Direction that's very unpredictable and put it on something like",
  "very unpredictable and put it on something like volatility that might just have a little bit of predictability in it and to begin that Journey let's make sure that we're all on the same page when it comes to option profitability when it comes to generating returns and achieving profitability there are essentially three factors involved Direction time and volatility and when most people get into trading they focus exclusively on Direction without paying much attention to time or volatility but",
  "paying much attention to time or volatility but given just how random and unpredictable the market is I think that order of operations is backwards trading Direction can certainly come but it should come after time and after volatility with options and even more specifically short options we can shift our emphasis away from needing to be right directionally and instead trade the simple passage of time and the expansions and contractions of volatility two non-directional metrics in the",
  "of volatility two non-directional metrics in the marketplace that can serve as the foundation to your portfolio one of the first things that you're going to notice when you shift your focus away from Direction and onto volatility is you will have just unlocked A Whole New World of analysis that is now available to you one additional thing that you're going to discover when you shift your focus onto volatility when it comes to your analysis is you now have a whole new way to diversifying your",
  "you now have a whole new way to diversifying your portfolio and not only the risk that you're exposed to but also the opportunities that you find when it comes to your existing positions and the new trades that you might be looking at for most traditional investors volatility and huge spikes in volatility are not normally well received because if I'm a traditional investor and I'm invested just passively long in you know spy then I'm just looking to ride the gradual movement higher in that",
  "to ride the gradual movement higher in that stock or in that index over time when volatility spikes that usually means the market is suffering a significant drop so that's clearly not going to be good for your traditional passively long investor but for you when volatility comes that's simply going to mean more opportunity it could be exactly what you've been waiting for to deploy more Capital into short option strategies and take advantage of the volatility spikes but also from a",
  "of the volatility spikes but also from a diversification standpoint there's one other thing to make mention of while market prices and Market volatility have clearly shown to exhibit an inverse relationship a rather reliable inverse relationship over time where when market prices go up Market volatility is typically going down and when market prices go down Market volatility is typically going up this relationship is not one for one and this relationship is also not perfect there will be plenty",
  "is also not perfect there will be plenty of times when market prices are up and Market volatility is up or market prices are down and Market volatility is down that's important because it clearly illustrates the simple fact that volatility is its own independent metric in a lot of ways so it's going to give you a way an Avenue to diversify the exposure in your portfolio that you simply cannot get by just shifting assets into you know fixed income or currencies or precious metals so as we get",
  "or currencies or precious metals so as we get underway in this crash course here is the first major takeaway trade volatility first not Direction doing so is going to shift the foundation of your portfolio away from the randomness and the unpredictability of daytoday Market movements so here we are inside of the tasty trade platform and I just want to offer a brief overview of a few of the things that are relevant when it comes to market-wide volatility so on the leftand side here forward SL VX",
  "so on the leftand side here forward SL VX so this guy right here this is going to be your volatility Futures going out to whatever the front month might B which I believe right now V is going to be November so you have for/ VX is now trading at 2040 the other market-wide volatility metric that is commonly used if I scroll down on this watch list is going to be the vix itself so this is your Market wide volatility this is often times referred to as the fear indicator or the fear gauge in the",
  "to as the fear indicator or the fear gauge in the marketplace right now you have you know vix trading at 1921 so in terms of trying to get some type of idea regarding what is is market-wide volatility doing often times Traders will look at Future volatility so for/ VX wherever the Futures Contract might be right now we're trading the vcycle or the vix the vix which is kind of your spot volatility or your current volatility let's say I'm looking at Apple if I go into the quote overview of Apple",
  "at Apple if I go into the quote overview of Apple so I've got Apple loaded up in the ticker box I bring over this right hand side bar that's available inside of tasty trade I click on the overview if you look down at this IV Index this is going to give you just in one number what the implied volatility is for apple the reason why this is important is because for specific stocks it's a bit of a misnomer to say the implied volatility of Apple is X and the reason why is simply because every single",
  "and the reason why is simply because every single stock has a myriad of implied volatilities associated with it because different expirations have different implied volatilities and different strikes within those expirations have different implied volatilities case in point for Apple you see the IV index is 28.6 if I go to the trade page I simply look at the different expiration cycles look at how the implied volatilities differ from one cycle to the next now you can make the case that's not a",
  "the next now you can make the case that's not a big difference but that's not really the point the point is there are different numbers associated with different expiration cycles and then if I open up an expiration cycle like let's say open up November right here with 41 days to go and you start looking at the different strikes that are available inside of that expiration you're going to see different implied volatilities if I change this drop- down menu one of these drop downs from extrinsic",
  "down menu one of these drop downs from extrinsic value to implied volatility you can clearly see that now I have a number of implied volatilities inside the same expiration cycle for the different strikes that are available inside that cycle so again it's a bit of a misnomer to say the implied volatility for apple is X but tasty trade does a nice job of kind of giving us this average implied volatility of taking you know a lot of the relevant metrics that exist for that stock and giving us just",
  "that exist for that stock and giving us just one number number so we have some idea of whether or not we're dealing with a high volatility stock or a low volatility stock especially when we're comparing you know Apple versus Proctor and Gamble now the next metric that I wanted to go ahead and at least introduce you to at this point we're going to have a lot more to say about this as the crash course moves on but the IV rank so right up here you see this ivr for apple is 44.9 now later on I'm",
  "see this ivr for apple is 44.9 now later on I'm going to explain you know what that number means I'm going to explain how we use it in you know trading volatility and all of those things but just know right now that when it comes to you know shifting your focus away from Trading Direction and now trading something like volatility where the foundation of your portfolio is going to look a lot different from what it was when you were so focused on you know Direction exclusively looking at metrics",
  "you know Direction exclusively looking at metrics like implied volatility looking at metrics like IV rank these are going to be a big part of what you do on a daily basis so I simply wanted to introduce you to these ideas right here and right now what I want to do now is I want to talk more specifically about the nature of volatility how it changes and why that's important for us as active Traders so volatility is fluid and dynamic just like every other metric in the financial Marketplace and",
  "other metric in the financial Marketplace and this might surprise you but many of the financial models that we use every single day they actually assume constant volatility in the marketplace the reason why that is the case is allowing for changing volatility in Financial modeling a phenomenon more formly referred to as heteroskedasticity really complicates the fine-tuning that's necessary in these models to capture the complexities of the real markets even if they can only do so partly but for",
  "even if they can only do so partly but for us as practitioners as Traders we're not really super concerned with the theoretical obstacles that you know Academia might run into we just want to know hey how can I improve the risk term profile of my portfolio and so that's why something like heteroscedasticity might present a lot of problems to you know Financial Academia for us as Traders it's actually a really really big deal because it gives us a ton of opportunity Cas in point when it comes to",
  "ton of opportunity Cas in point when it comes to market conditions you basically have three different states that the market could fall into from a volatility standpoint you have expansion you have contraction and you have a low and as Julia show in figure 2.2 inside of the Unlucky Investors Guide to option trading volatility expansion occurs 10% of the time volatility contraction occurs 20% of the time and volatility lows occurs 70% of the time as the name implies volatility expansions are",
  "as the name implies volatility expansions are when volatility is rising quickly volatility contractions are when volatility is falling quickly and volatility lows are when the volatility is typically stable with a general tendency to slow grind lower over time as the market slowly Rises well it is these different states that we want to take advantage of and in a perfect world it would be simple we would just sell volatility when volatility is Contracting or we're inside of a volatility LW and",
  "or we're inside of a volatility LW and then buy volatility when volatility is expanding but unfortunately that perfect world is not the world that we live in and that we trade in so we are always up against the randomness and the unpredictability of the market and we can never know with certainty what's going to happen next still we can use these empirical findings to our advantage doing this we find that volatility is usually moving lower either quickly during a contraction or slowly during a",
  "quickly during a contraction or slowly during a low and this accounts for roughly 90% of the days in the market it is only 10% of the time that volatility is significantly expanding it's fairly easy to see that selling volatility would appear to give us a far greater number of opportunities than buying buying volatility this is the case because selling volatility can benefit greatly from volatility contractions or volatility lows whereas buying volatility might only be able to cash in during",
  "volatility might only be able to cash in during those far more seldom volatility expansions to be fair we are painting with a fairly wide brush here volatility sellers can certainly make money during volatility expansions and volatility buyers can also make money during volatility contractions p&l is multifactorial however it doesn't change the fact that if you're in a market where volatility wants to go lower where volatility is usually falling man you're going to have a far easier time being",
  "man you're going to have a far easier time being on the short side of that volatility trade than you would being on the long side of that volatility trade no one knows what's going to happen next when it comes to Market volatility there might actually be just a wee little bit of predictive power that we can tap into you know if I go into a stock like Amazon let's say go into the trade page and I'm inside of November with 41 days to go I've got my expected move right there in the center of the",
  "my expected move right there in the center of the screen you know if I set up something like a short call spread to be bearish on the stock you know I sell a 195 call I buy a 200 call you know this is a very very classic short premium strategy that's defined risk you can see the maximum loss is 335 the maximum profit is 165 and all the other trade metrics that are associated with this trade but now let's say I clear this away and I want to do something that's undefined risk and maybe I have a",
  "that's undefined risk and maybe I have a neutral bias on Amazon so I could just just you know I could sell a 170 put just going right outside the expected move there and I could sell a 205 call going right outside the expected move on the upside and now I have a neutral strategy where I'm going to benefit the most from Amazon staying between my strikes if I go over to the curve view here you'll see that a bit more clearly curve you click on the analysis button and you can see the p&l diagram",
  "analysis button and you can see the p&l diagram that is just nicely presented here inside of tasty trade kind of shows us where we make money where we lose money where our risk is our break even points and all of those things just kind of painting with a very very broad brush to show you what is available inside Tasty Tray and these are only two short premium strategies there's a whole another hemisphere with long premium and debit strategies and we'll look at those a bit later inside of this",
  "we'll look at those a bit later inside of this course specifically going back to the table view take a look at one of the metrics so you have a couple of drop- down columns where you can select different variables to look at for your trade analysis and you can see I could choose you know Theta gamma and all kinds of other metrics well right here I have Vega selected for a reason Vega is one of the Greeks that is a first derivative of the black Souls model and it shows us how sensitive that",
  "Souls model and it shows us how sensitive that strike is going to be to any changes in volatility because it's going to show you how many cents is my option contract going to move by when volatility changes by one point here's the most important part for what we're trying to do here it's not so much the magnitude of the Vega it's actually just the sign of the Vega when when it comes to specifically a strategy like a short call spread right when I have a short call spread and you can see I'm",
  "I have a short call spread and you can see I'm selling the 195 strike so I'm going to be short 24 Vega I'm buying the 200 strike I'm going to be long 22 Vega the net result there is minus 2 Vega so you are going to be short Vega you are going to be short volatility you are going to be able to benefit from any falling volatility let's clear this strategy away and let's look at an altogether different strategy if I were to sell a strangle let's say just using the expected move as my anchor for",
  "say just using the expected move as my anchor for strike selection if I sell the 170 put and I sell the 205 call let's say just kind of outside the expected move on both sides the most important part here is yes you can look at probabilities you can look at credits you can look at deltas and thetas and the thing that I want to look at right now though is the Vega impact of this strategy remember if you sell an option you're negative Vega if you buy an option you're positive Vega now when we",
  "buy an option you're positive Vega now when we looked at the call spread just a second ago we were selling one option and buying another option as part of the spread so we had to take the difference to figure out what our net Vega exposure was well when you have a strategy like a strangle this is something that can really capitalize on falling volatility because you are selling options on both sides of the market I'm selling a 170 p and an 18 Vega and I'm selling a 205 call and a 19 Vega so",
  "Vega and I'm selling a 205 call and a 19 Vega so there's no watering down effect there's no buying back Vega from long options in the strategy like we saw with the call spread my point and my purpose of doing this right now is just to show you the potential of what shifting your focus away from Direction can do for you by looking at things like volatility by looking at things like ivr which we're going to look at a bit later on by looking at things like option Vega to actually capture and",
  "things like option Vega to actually capture and measure just how sensitive your positions are to any changing volatility that might happen in the marketplace what you're going to see next might shock you volatility has been shown to possess a mean reverting characteristic and to understand what that means we could actually take a few approaches we could take a mathematical approach we could take an intuitive approach or we could take an empirical approach so let's take a look and discuss each",
  "approach so let's take a look and discuss each of those three first mathematically many academics and researchers over the years have demonstrated and powerfully so that we can assume Market volatility is what is known as a stationary process a process where any data points that lead the variable in question away from its mean are met with additional data points that fight to bring the variable back to its mean or in other words what goes up must eventually come back down and vice versa second",
  "eventually come back down and vice versa second we could take an intuitive approach to volatility mean reversion we're given the natural e and flow of the financial markets Global events and just the natural uncertainty in the world it makes a lot of sense that periods of steadiness and stability low volatility will be followed by some kind of shock at some point volatility expansion in periods of chaos High volatility will will be followed by calm volatility contraction that's very intuitive",
  "calm volatility contraction that's very intuitive and it just makes a lot of sense but third and most relevant for our purposes here we could take an empirical approach and simply say regardless of what the mathematical Theory might support or our own intuitive analysis might suggest what does the actual data say because in the end that's all that matters right I mean that's the trump card that's the Arbiter of Truth the results themselves well not surprisingly the tasty live research team has",
  "not surprisingly the tasty live research team has looked at volatility mean reversion a number of times in a number of different ways over the years but one study the team did back in August of 2022 really highlights and illustrates the power of volatility mean r verion especially from the short side of the option contract so first when looking at the vix data that were available going back to 2000 in this study we see that the probability of an update or down day in the vix itself on any",
  "of an update or down day in the vix itself on any random day was skewed slightly in favor of a down day in the vix 53 to 47 this makes sense because the probability of an upday or a down day in the overall Market on any random day is skewed slightly in favor of an update 53 to 47 over time the market has experienced positive drift so an upward bias to reflect this drift makes sense and since market prices and Market volatility are inversely related it then follows that we would see a slight",
  "it then follows that we would see a slight downward bias on any random day in the vix but what happens after we've had a consecutive streak of down days or up days in the vix do the probabilities change yes and in some pretty remarkable ways after a series of down dayss in the vix the probabilities of what the next day will do don't change much they stay clustered around 50/50 between an upday and a down day but as the down day Street continues we can see there is a slight shift in favor of the",
  "can see there is a slight shift in favor of the next day being an upd in the vix showing some volatility expansion so in other words there does appear to be a tiny bit of mean reversion after volatility has been contracting for even just a short time but the remarkable part comes after a series of updats in the vix because now we see something very different here the probabilities do begin changing in in some significant ways from the very first update the probabilities move off of 50/50 and",
  "update the probabilities move off of 50/50 and they begin to Cluster more closely around 6040 in favor of volatility Contracting and mean reverting back to a lower level so when volatility is low you could certainly make the case that this is a good environment for some long volatility strategies some debit strategies like a long vertical spread a calendar spread diagonal spread like that would be a good strategic way of thinking about how to take advantage of that environment and while the",
  "take advantage of that environment and while the stats might largely hang around 50/50 there might be a tiny little Advantage as that street continues in terms of a big volatility Spike or some kind of volatility Spike coming your way you could certainly do that but the real benefit of taking advantage of volatility mean reversion is on the other side after volatility has expanded that's when we can step in with a short volatility strategy like a short vertical spread iron Condor short put",
  "a short vertical spread iron Condor short put short strangle whatever and take advantage of a market that is clearly shown a propensity to want to revert back to a lower level of volatility which also lines up nicely with the different volatility conditions and volatility scenarios that we just learned about with contra actions and lulls you know kind of governing 90% of the market days that we trade in the overall market so you take these two things together and you have a really nice",
  "two things together and you have a really nice environment for short volatility trades so the big takeaway here is the volatility mean reversion that the market has exhibited can be quite advantageous especially from the short side of the option contract okay so now we have established a New Foundation of trading volatility we've taken a look at changing volatility and we even have some evidence for volatility mean reversion what I want to do now is begin to put all these pieces together in a",
  "is begin to put all these pieces together in a way that's going to help us trade and this is where taking a closer look at implied volatility and implied volatility rank come into play yes market-wide volatility metrics like the vix or the vix Futures give you a nice context the broader context of what might be happening you know RIT l in the overall Market indexes but when it comes to specifically selecting a strategy in a specific stock you want to dial in you want to really hone in your",
  "want to dial in you want to really hone in your focus on what's going on in that specific stock with its implied volatility and its implied volatility rank so let's begin with a closer look at implied volatility implied volatility essentially measures how volatile that specific underlying stock is expected to be over whatever time period perod you might be interested in higher implied volatility means more volatility and wider ranges are expected in the stock and lower implied volatility means",
  "in the stock and lower implied volatility means less volatility and narrower ranges are expected in the stock furthermore IV is one of the inputs into the black Souls option pricing model that is used to determine what the options price should be along with other metrics like the stock price the strike price time to exploration interest rates and any potential dividends the most important thing for us here is the relationship between the option price that eventually comes out of the black Souls",
  "that eventually comes out of the black Souls model and the IV of the stock that goes into the black shs model simply put if IV is higher then the option price will be higher and if IV is lower then the option price will be lower and if you're looking for a deeper dive into all things option pricing we actually have a separate crash course that's already on the YouTube channel so you can give that guy a look whenever you're ready but here the main takeaway is this if you're buying options with",
  "takeaway is this if you're buying options with Reit strategies like we've talked about before then using these in stocks that have lower IVs can make some sense but what's even more effective if you're selling options with credit strategies like we've talked about before so short vertical short strangles short puts Etc then using these in stocks that have higher IVs can certainly make some sense this is an oversimplification and implied volatility is not the only thing that you should consider",
  "is not the only thing that you should consider when you're doing your trade analysis as we're going to see here in just a couple of minutes but this is a really really good starting point for understanding how implied volatility impacts the option premium which is going to play a big role in whatever trade you do so now that we have a basic understanding of how implied volatility is going to impact our trading let's shift our Focus over to implied volatility rank or ivr while IV is a metric",
  "volatility rank or ivr while IV is a metric that gets input into the black Souls model ivr is a separate measurement that actually looks at IV relative to itself over some period of time let me show you what I mean what the ivr does is it looks at the range of implied volatility for that specific stock over the last 12 months and then it tells you where the current IV sits in that range so for example let's say the range of IVs for Apple over the last 12 months was a low of a 30 IV and a high",
  "last 12 months was a low of a 30 IV and a high of a 50 IV if the current IV was 40 then that means app's IV is right in the middle of the IV range over the last 12 months so its ivr would be 50 showing that it's sitting at the 50th percentile of that IV range and if Apple's IV was 35 then it would be five IV points into the 20 point IV range from 30 to 50 which would be the 25th percentile so an ivr of 25 similarly let's say you've got Amazon with an IV range of 25 on the low end and 65 on the",
  "an IV range of 25 on the low end and 65 on the high end following the same process if Amazon's current IV is 30 then it's five IV points into a 40 Point IV range which would be an ivr of 12.5 now there might also be times where you see ivrs that have moved outside of the zero to 100 boundaries this is actually pretty simple to deal with it simply means that the current implied volatility is either lower than the previous 12-month low or higher than the previous 12-month High more specifically",
  "than the previous 12-month High more specifically if you see an ivr of -10 that simply means the current implied volatility is 10% lower than the previous year's low or if you see an ivr of 106 that simply means that the current implied volatility is 6% higher than the previous year's high so our big takeaway here is just as we observed volatility mean reversion when looking at the market-wide metrics like the vix we want to take that same principle and apply it on a stock bystock basis but use",
  "and apply it on a stock bystock basis but use more finely tuned metrics that apply to that specific stock so like their implied volatility or their implied volatility rank that allows us to better capture any opportunities that might exist for that stock when it comes to volatility mean reversion and that's exactly what we're going to do next when we put all of this together and show you how to use it to begin trading volatility but the first question you might have is all right Jim I'm ready",
  "you might have is all right Jim I'm ready to start trading volatility but I got to know what actually constitutes High volatility which is a great question and it's an important question and for the answer we're again going to turn to the tasty live research team so back in August of 2023 the research team did a very simple study showing the difference between selling 16 Delta strangles on stocks with an ivr below 30 and stocks with an ivr above 30 and the key takeaways are twofold first notice",
  "30 and the key takeaways are twofold first notice that regardless of the ivr environment under 30 ivr or over 30 ivr selling premium was a profitable strategy but second while the win rates are essentially the same in both ivr environments the p&l between the two is drastically different where your average daily p&l in the under 30 ivr category was 25 cents a day but the average daily p&l in the over 30 ivr category was a15 a day or over 3x what you earned with a lower ivr now look I can",
  "what you earned with a lower ivr now look I can respect the fact that you may not want to sell volatility when an ivr is at four or six or nine because you don't want to get caught in the Whirlwind that is a huge volatility expansion that makes sense but if this is the first time that you're looking at Short options in Earnest then I wanted to at least take a couple of seconds and just point out the ubiquity nature of their effectiveness in all market conditions because that might be rather",
  "market conditions because that might be rather surprising to you but by all means when ivrs are low and implied volatility is suppressed like that might be the time to mix in your debit strategies your long verticals your calendars your diagonals Etc and we'll take a look at those in just a few minutes but in terms of trying to figure out you know where is your reference point between High volatility and low volatility using 30 as kind of a marker in the sand in terms of high ivr and low ivr",
  "in the sand in terms of high ivr and low ivr that's a pretty good reference point that's a pretty good starting point for your analysis but again ivr much like everything else in the marketplace is fluid and dynamic and so it should be just that a starting point for your analysis right some Traders might prefer to lower that number to where now they're looking for you know ivrs of only 20 or 25 and they're comfortable selling premium other Traders might feel a lot more comfortable when the ivrs",
  "might feel a lot more comfortable when the ivrs have really expanded to 35 or 40 and that's when they pounce with short premium strategies there is no right or wrong answer here there are a number of ways that you could slice this up but if you're just getting started and you're looking for a clear reference point then use 30 adjust it over time based on your style your risk tolerance your account size your experience level all those different things so let's dive into tasty trade and let's set",
  "so let's dive into tasty trade and let's set up some short volatility trades together okay so you are now ready to begin trading volatility like where do I even begin tasty trade makes it fairly easy to do that so you go inside of the hamburger menu that's right you click on the watch list now there's all kinds of different watch lists that you could choose from the two that I would strongly recommend you start with you can play around the other ones start with either the tasty default or Tom's",
  "ones start with either the tasty default or Tom's watch list the great thing about you know the tasty default which we'll click on here these are all going to be stocks that are pre-screened for liquidity these are all the big names the big players that everybody in the market is trading the next thing you want to look at is you have this IV rank as one of the dropdowns that you can go ahead and sort the list by well again if I'm looking for opportunities to sell premium I'm going to want to",
  "to sell premium I'm going to want to click on this and sort from high to low so I clicked on it once now it's sorted from low to high I click on it again and now it's sorted from high to low and so now I'm in a situation where I can very clearly see this is the IV rank of these different stocks you can see on the list we've got IBM we've got chipotle Etc so there are many many many different names to choose from so let's say I open up Starbucks which has an IV rank of almost 75 and the stock",
  "which has an IV rank of almost 75 and the stock price is $97 I open up Starbucks click on the trade page I go into let's say the November cycle with 41 days to go again they have earnings on November 7th so this may or may not be a good trade when it comes to putting it on right now going into the earnings date but given the fact that so many individual stocks have earnings coming up I'm not going to be able to avoid that right here and right now because of the time of the year that we are",
  "now because of the time of the year that we are doing this video so let's bypass the earnings impact for the purposes of what we're trying to accomplish right now if I open up November you know let's say that I was bullish on Starbucks well one of the strategies I could use a very popular strategy when you're bullish on a stock is you could sell a put spread so I could go in here and I could sell the 95 put and I could buy the 90 put and I will be able to collect a $1.74 credit 62% pop positive",
  "able to collect a $1.74 credit 62% pop positive Theta positive Delta of course because it's a bullish strategy your p50 is 77% my maximum loss is only the difference between the width of the spread and the credit that I collect and so all the trade metrics are looking pretty good on this specific strategy but again what I really want to focus on here is the volatility impact you know you have the Vega here where you're looking at how sensitive is this Strate y to changing volatility well this",
  "is this Strate y to changing volatility well this is a spread so I'm selling volatility on one leg and essentially buying volatility on the other leg I'm short 13 Vegas here I'm long 10 Vegas there so my net Vega exposure is -3 because I'm short 13 and I'm long 10 so by being short three Vega I am going to have some negative volatility exposure remember that when the market Rises volatility typically goes down so look at how well you can strategic Ally play you know the market or Starbucks in",
  "Ally play you know the market or Starbucks in this specific instance by setting up a short put spread in that if you are correct and the stock rallies because you're positive Delta you want the stock to move higher then you're probably going to see the implied volatility of Starbucks go down because most stocks do follow that relationship volatility is its own metric some stocks when the price Rises the volatility Also Rises and when you know the price goes down the volatility goes down that",
  "the price goes down the volatility goes down that does happen too but most individual stocks are going to follow suit with the overall Market where you have the inverse relationship between volatility and price and so by choosing something like a short put spread you're able to capitalize on any volatility contraction that might happen in the marketplace which could also be accompanied by a market Rising a stock going higher which is going to be really really good for your short put spread",
  "be really really good for your short put spread strategy here but an altogether different strategy that you could choose that's very similar in a lot of ways but different in some significant ones is you could just you know clear this away and let's say you want to go into with an undefined risk strategy that's going to be able to better capitalize on any volatility contractions so maybe you go in and you just sell a 90 put so now you can see this is still a bullish strategy similar to the one",
  "is still a bullish strategy similar to the one we just had it's even more bullish than the short put spread but now you have a higher probability of making 50% which makes sense because that's the general relationship between undefined risk and defined risk but now you have short 10 Vega right there's no long Vega there's no defined risk so now you have more exposure to volatility contraction now of course it's been said before for every gimme there's a Goa so you might be wondering R jim I've",
  "a Goa so you might be wondering R jim I've got this gimme of more Vega I've got this gimme of more volatility exposure where is the gcha well what happens if Starbucks goes down you're going to get hurt more than you would with that short PPR of course it's games and gotas you know it's pros and cons it's trade-offs it's always trade-offs you could make your whole career for your whole investing life just selling puss from start to finish I know many traders who have done that have been really",
  "many traders who have done that have been really really successful you've got positive drift you've got negative Vega you have so many things that are working for you that are in your favor so there's a couple of examples of what you can do with short volatility trades and of course there's so many other things that you can do I mean the permutations and combinations that are available in the world of options even just on the short side alone are almost literally endless and so use this as a",
  "are almost literally endless and so use this as a starting point to uncover additional short premium trades that you can begin to add to your portfolio now of course there might be some times when you want to play a debit strategy maybe play for a volatility Spike so let's hop back into tasty trade now and work through how to set those up as well there are a million other things that you could do I've only begun to scratch the surface but I just kind of wanted to push you out of the nest with a",
  "kind of wanted to push you out of the nest with a couple little examples and a couple of examples that will probably resonate with you if you're coming from a stock world if you're coming from a long-term investing world where you like playing the market to the upside well short put spreads and short puts are going to do that just like we did on the short premium side let's set up a couple of long premium trades that would benefit from vol ility expanding so let's go into the watch list here go",
  "expanding so let's go into the watch list here go back to my watch list I've got tasty default I'm going to sort my IV rank from low to high cuz now I'm looking for a low implied volatility opportunity to you know put on a debit strategy it's going to benefit from volatility expanding well one thing that catches my eye here is QQ this is the NASDAQ index you know the IV rank is 27 so it's not super low it is below 30 from that study but even even though the study was more focused on you know",
  "though the study was more focused on you know short premium and selling premium strategies still this is is not a terrible opportunity for buying premium and there aren't too many low volatility options right now you've got the vix at 20 you've got vix Futures at just over 20 as well so there's just not a ton of low volatility opportunities in the marketplace right now so if I go into QQQ a classic strategy to take advantage of volatility expansion is an at the- money put vertical so let's say",
  "is an at the- money put vertical so let's say you're bearish on the NASDAQ and you want to position yourself to take advantage of volatility expansion well what you could do you've got the stock at 486 and some change you could step in here you could buy a 490 put and you could sell a 480 put so this is an at the money vertical you see the probability of profit is right around 50% that's typically what we want with an attim money vertical this is usually a directional shot that you're taking in",
  "usually a directional shot that you're taking in the stock but from a volatility standpoint the nice thing about using a long put vertical is it does set you up with positive Vega it's not a ton we want to make our money on the short volatility side of the market but you do have a little something here where you're buying 66 Vega you're selling 64 Vega you're going to be slightly net positive Vega so you do have a little bit of long Vega exposure which is nice because you're also going to",
  "which is nice because you're also going to benefit like if I go to the curve view here you can see I make money if QQQ goes down it's a bearish trade that makes perfect sense if the market prices are going down Market volatility is often times going up and so this is a situation where man I could get paid on the Delta from the market going down but I also get paid a little kicker from volatility expanding because I'm positive Vega so this is one way to set up a positive Vega volatility",
  "is one way to set up a positive Vega volatility expanding trade using just an equity index and of course there's a number of different ways that you could do this you can t take this example explore other stocks other underlyings and things like that but one of the other strategies that is even more positive Vega is you could go in here and you could set up a calendar spread and so again you've got QQ at 486 487 maybe you want to say Okay I want to be neutral on the NASDAQ index I don't really",
  "to be neutral on the NASDAQ index I don't really want a ton of directional exposure either way at least not right now but I want to play for some volatility expansion well again focusing on this Vega that we see here on this little column on this drop down a calendar spread of course is I'm buying the back month I'm selling the front month they're overlapping strikes so here I'm in November with 41 days to go maybe I sell this 485 put so I'm selling 66 Vega at the 485 put I minimize November I",
  "66 Vega at the 485 put I minimize November I open up December and I buy the same strike the 485 put so the strategy is going to cost me $4 but look at the Vega impact that you're going to have on this strategy you're going to be long 20 plus vegga so you are going to have a lot of positive volatility exposure you can make the case well Jim if volatility expands you know the market may go down a lot more it may not stay around 45 that would be bad for this strategy and so on and so forth and I",
  "for this strategy and so on and so forth and I would not necessarily argue with you so maybe you want to adjust your strikes maybe you want to move these things a bit lower my purpose here was just to again give you a couple of examples of how to trade volatility from both the short side and the long side my overachievers out there y all probably noticed how I just kind of glossed over like all right let's say you're bullish on this stock let's say you're bearish on that stock let's not talk",
  "say you're bearish on that stock let's not talk about how we arrived at that you know directional bias let's just assume that it's there my overachievers are probably thinking wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute how did you come to that conclusion well again when it comes to day-to-day movements I firmly believe it's all completely random so you can use the charts you can use the balance sheets you can use the whatevers to determine you your own personal directional bias in that",
  "you your own personal directional bias in that underlying stock but if you want you know some guidance if you want some reference points for your overall portfolio directional metrics then I would encourage you to check out the portfolio management crash course that's already on the YouTube channel and if you sit tight for about 3 seconds it's actually going to start right now"
