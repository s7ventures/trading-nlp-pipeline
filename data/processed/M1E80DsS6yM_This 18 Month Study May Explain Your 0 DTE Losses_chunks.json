  "Exiting by time and profit in zero DTE trading offers flexibility. Managing trades by closing winners can increase the proportion of winning trades. This strategy has been key to success for zero DT trades. For 45-day expiration trades, we often combine this with existing positions at 21 DTS and exit early to limit downside risk. Implementing a similar strategy for zero DT trades may help curtail losses by exiting all trades.",
  "Our strategy for managing Zer DT losers involves exiting all trades at a fixed time of the day. This approach may not be effective as historical optimal times may not work in the future. It could be more beneficial to quantify risk versus reward when selling options or buying options on Zero days.",
  "Buying options on zero days can be advantageous. Exiting all trades at a fixed time of the day, such as noon or 11 o'clock, can help minimize losses.",
  "Next slide: 18 months of data shows trading 20 Delta strangles at market open. Manage winners at profit targets of 15-50% initial credit. Exit trades at fixed times in Central Standard Time. Assume mid price for more realistic returns.",
  "Managing winners at 15% is important, regardless of the exit time. Most of the time, you are not collecting a significant amount of money, so it is crucial to stick to this strategy.",
  "In trading, exiting by noon statistically yields the best results. Managing winners at 25% is common practice for many traders.",
  "If you exit at noon, you significantly lower the risk of outliers. These are 20 Delta strangles. Let's move on to the next slide at 35%.",
  "Currently at 35%, all trades are winners. The Sear is higher later on, but without a fixed exit time, it's difficult to determine the best risk versus reward. The Bat trade looks promising, especially when considering the Sear. Without considering the Sear, trades with no fixed exit time also look favorable.",
  "the current time looks good. Let's move on to the next slide, which shows a ratio of five and a half to four and a half. It's a significant gain, with potential for even more.",
  "Great show while you were away. We agreed on things based on the paper. No fixed days for this page. Six out of seven days before reaching the takeaways. Admit that the bat was correct. Let's move on to the takeaways when placing zero DT trades at market open.",
  "Placing zero DT trades at Market open, deciding to exit before noon to cut down on risk but with a proportional drop in net average profits. Exiting trades at 2m did little to reduce cvar but gave up significant p&l compared to holding out to the close. Choosing the right management techniques for your account is a personal balance of risk and reward. Examining past results can help inform your decisions.",
  "Past results inform future decisions. The key takeaway is the mechanics of the trade. Holding until close may increase risk, but can also yield good results."
