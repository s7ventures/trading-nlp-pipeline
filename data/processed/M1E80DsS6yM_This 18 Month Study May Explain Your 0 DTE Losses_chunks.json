  "exiting by time and profit in zero DTE much of the flexibility of options comes from investors freedom to manage trades closing winners can help increase the proportion of winning trades that has appeared to be the key to success for zero DT trades for 45d expiration trades we often combine this with existing positions at 21 DTS we exit early win or lose it helps limit downside risk will a parallel strategy work for zero DT trades can we curtail our worst Zer DT losers by exiting all trades win",
  "our worst Zer DT losers by exiting all trades win or lose at a fixed time of the day what do you think about that I I've never seen it done before so I would say no can't like I don't think they're going to find and I I mean an optimal time in the past is not going to work for an optimal time in the future I think it'll just be be random I mean maybe you can quantify it out versus risk versus reward when you're selling options maybe that makes buying options on the Zero days more or",
  "makes buying options on the Zero days more or advantageous for that moment I think it's pretty random uh I don't see how it can be I'm going to disagree okay I'm going to say that I think we can curtail our worst DT losers by exiting all trades win or lose at a fixed time of the day meaning what that what that means is we're not going to hold anything past noon let's say or past 11 o'clock I I think it's going to be pretty pretty di Minimus let's go to the next slide that push you off the edge",
  "go to the next slide that push you off the edge today so 18 months worth of data 20 Delta strangles at the opening each day considered a variety of management techniques closing the winners at profit targets from 15 to 50% of all initial credit and exiting a variety of fixed times all times are standard Central Standard Time and then all trades are assumed to exercise a mid price so you can subtract a few dollars 1015 $20 if you want more realistic returns um let's go next slide because",
  "realistic returns um let's go next slide because everything doesn't trade at Mid price obviously so first of all managing winners at 15% we've done this a bunch of times but you can see here that managing winners at 15% which is a very small number because most the time you're collecting you know you're you're not collecting that much money in this case but managing winners at 15% whether you exit at noon um 11: noon 1 two or um or no fixed exit time this was this was all pretty good okay",
  "exit time this was this was all pretty good okay across the board sure I mean this is where you get your getting out by noon as a statistical you know yeah I mean no fixed time you know you make 13 bucks I mean yeah but but but noon noon was the best in this case okay let's go next slide so this is when you start to get you you start to pump it up a little bit and this time managing winners at 25% which is a lot of people that's kind of the Wheelhouse and if you see it's funny no fixed exit",
  "and if you see it's funny no fixed exit time this would this would be what the bat kind of said okay random um that was probably the best here and noon also worked as well the sear significantly lower if you exit at noon you take out the outlier risk basically so the difference that exiting at noon is take out the outlier risk everything else kind of worked if and and again these are 20 Delta strangles um so far so good yep let's go to the next slide so now at 35% and and the funny thing is all",
  "so now at 35% and and the funny thing is all these are winners but the sear is a lot higher later on but with no fixed eggs of time and just I said you could probably look at risk versus reward and say that one of the fixed times is going to be better because because of the of the sear but you can see here no fixed exit time so far bat looks pretty good yeah I mean noon looks pretty good if you include sear if you don't include sear no fixed exit time looks pretty good I agree I'm surprised by",
  "time looks pretty good I agree I'm surprised by that actually let's go to next slide five and a half to four and a half right now that's how you agree um like wholeheartedly you know what I mean yeah and and what's interesting here is that throughout this whole process this is man is only up by you know 50% but your gains are 100% so if you extrapolate it out it's a big winner you want a biscuit you want a cookie oh where's my son we had such a great show when you were gone and we looked at",
  "a great show when you were gone and we looked at things and agreed on them because they were right there on paper you want a cookie I'll get your cookie um yeah same same situation for this for this page here um noon works but no fixed days this six out of seven before you get to the takeaways would you like before you get to takeaways please don't put them up yet would you like to admit that the bat was correct here let's go to the takeaways when placing zero DT trades at Market open deciding",
  "placing zero DT trades at Market open deciding to get out before noon win or lose cut down on risk but with a proportional drop in net average profits exiting later however was ineffective exiting trades at 2m did little to reduce cvar but gave up significant p&l compared to holding out to the close so choosing the right management techniques for your account is a personal balance of risk and reward but examining past by examining but by examining past results hopefully it can be an informed",
  "past results hopefully it can be an informed Choice the takeaway from here was mechanics the takeaway is mechanic noon wasn't bad but if you had to hold to the close in this case it was also pretty good you took more risk but it was pretty good"
