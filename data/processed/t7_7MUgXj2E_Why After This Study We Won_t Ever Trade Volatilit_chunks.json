  "separating reality from Fear fix expansion separating reality from Fear so selling premium and high implied volatility is ideal because the trader will likely benefit from a volatility contraction volatility as we talked about yesterday and many other times is mean reverting so when it goes up it's at some point it's going to come down sometimes it stays high for a long time like 2008 to 2009 stayed high for almost I want to say almost two 300 days or something but usually it's five or six days",
  "or something but usually it's five or six days and volatility goes gets high and then it contracts but when selling low volatility there's the risk of implied volatility expansion that's volatility going up how serious has this risk been over time because we know that volatility goes up um I mean we know when volatility goes up it goes up really fast and we know when it comes down it's like H it could be torture sometimes but sure how much of a risk is volatility exploding what do you think",
  "a risk is volatility exploding what do you think let's go to next slide and we'll give tony some more I don't know I got a percentage let's give let's give him some I'm gonna give him some more information before I ask cont y so we're going to look at the Spy we're going to look at Tesla the reason we chose Tesla is because of all the stocks that are out there um that's consistently been in the top of the um most actively traded ones like right now it probably be I think Nvidia is the most",
  "now it probably be I think Nvidia is the most actively traded options you know um yeah it's always been the one with some of the most volume but Tesla's number two right now and Tesla's always been one or two I want to say for the last like five years so we're using spy and Tesla they've been one and two for the longest period of time we're selling 16 Delta triangle 45 days to expiration manag in 21 days and we compared when the vix range is when it's below 15 between 15 and 30 which it is",
  "when it's below 15 between 15 and 30 which it is right now and then above 30 which it is a very small percent of the time in fact I want to say based on the research we did yesterday that I kind of remember that number to be like around 7% of the time I I don't know if that's right Tony but I think we're above 30 about 7% of the time we're between 15 and 30 um we're between 15 and 30 probably about about 40 to 50% of the time and then obviously the balance below 50 um yeah in the last calendar",
  "the balance below 50 um yeah in the last calendar year from February to February it's probably even less than that it's only three or four times in the whole year yeah Beth there's a it says b o l o I'm sorry b o l w just change that to an E so we so we don't so we look perfect thank you let's go next slide so for example when the price of the Spy 16 Delta strangle will be higher when implied volatility is higher resulting in a loss seller okay obviously when when volatility goes up premium",
  "obviously when when volatility goes up premium sellers lose money so implied volatility is 15% you collect 335 if it's 25% you collect um 505 and if it's 35% you collect 7 uh 35 so it's it's obviously when when volatility goes up proportionately the amount of Premium goes up the other thing is when you're selling 16 Delta strangles when volatility is cheap um you don't make a lot of money when volatility is expensive or at least higher you make money so that's the most important takeaway from",
  "money so that's the most important takeaway from this entire slide it's it's not it's that the return on investment is a negative number when volatility is low that's why we use IV rank to tell us when to get into positions and all that kind of stuff because we don't do well unless implied volatility is on the higher end of its range we're talking about IV this is we're talking about straight fix but but we use ivr to help us with individual stocks to put context around everything um you can",
  "to put context around everything um you can see the higher the implied volatility the better that we do the buying power the probability of profit everything's going to be kind of the same um but we just the average p&l and the return on investment is better when volatility is higher let's go next slide so to put context around volatility expansion risk we examine the frequency at and the magnitude of expansions we recorded the vix on day 1 and day 45 and computed the difference this was done",
  "day 45 and computed the difference this was done every trading day since 2017 you can imagine the amount of data in here this is almost eight years worth of stuff let's go next slide so for spy in very low implied volatility 75% of the 45-day periods saw vix change of less than 3.7 points so it was fairly rare to see a significant change at the end of the period yes and I think this is the important thing you can't and and and I can't tell you how many times we stressed this you cannot time a",
  "how many times we stressed this you cannot time a vix expansion it's that's why it's so difficult to inventory long vix because you know at some point it's going higher but you cannot inventory it because it's untable if that's actually a word to hold if your timing is off yeah you cannot time it so what happens here is that you can see that that the the biggest risk to the upside is when the vix is below 15 and the least amount of risk to the upside in the vix is when the vix is above 30 um",
  "upside in the vix is when the vix is above 30 um but you know again it's a very difficult thing to time you have almost no risk I shouldn't say no risk but longterm when the vix is above 30 it contracts longterm when the vix is between 15 and 30 it also contracts but when the vix is below 15 it expands let's go to next slide even for individual stocks such as Tesla when the implied volatility is very low 75% of the 45-day periods experienced the vix Exchange of less than 3.8 points very similar",
  "vix Exchange of less than 3.8 points very similar to the Spy almost a tenth of a point difference but as a result the significant changes by the end of these periods were relatively rare So if you're betting on implied volatility going higher in Tesla again it only happens from very low levels of implied volatility it does not happen when the vix is above 30 it's interesting to see how close the vix and the Spy are to each other when you just look at this stuff let's go next slide so the other",
  "at this stuff let's go next slide so the other main factors that drive p&l of a short premium trade are Delta and Theta trade p&l often comes from time Decay Theta and from Price movement Delta more than it does volatility that's a very fair statement um you know we're volatility sellers so we're more dependent on volatility contraction um but you know there's a good little good little slide let's go next next slide as shown in our previous studies selling premium in low implied volatility low",
  "selling premium in low implied volatility low ivr can be profitable even if it can be minimum though it's reasonable to mitigate um IV expansion so again when IV is really low reduce the number of contracts in overall size and maintain some short Delta to offset the vager risk the vager risk is just that volatility expands and that's mostly going to happen in down mod let's go to the last slide"
