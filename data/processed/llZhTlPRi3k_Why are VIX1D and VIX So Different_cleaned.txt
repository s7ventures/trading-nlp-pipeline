I noticed early in the day that the vix was higher but the vix one day was lower how can that be one day implied volatility versus the monthly implied volatility with the vix is looking out 30 days and the one day only cares about here and now the next couple hours they really are very independent of one another on many days you'll find the vix one day significantly lower if nothing's going on
