  "intraday implied volatility and zero DT success this is part of our zero DT series are you ready I am ready or little zero DT talk I'm ready okay bring it on let's do it be should be right in front of you Tom the Zer DT markets in the right underlyings are incredibly liquid and fast moving demanding that zero DT Traders be some of the most attentive and active Traders this degree of Market awareness means constantly looking for signs to adjust positions one of the most important Market",
  "adjust positions one of the most important Market statistics for short premium success is implied volatility remember we talked about the vix one day yes where do you think it is today that's why I didn't do a 0 DT 866 it's probably still in the E handle 866 how have zero short premium trades performed when looking at intraday IV changes and how can we account for this in our mechanics I don't know but you got six slides that going to tell me we how we can that is correct thank you very much",
  "we how we can that is correct thank you very much welcome let's take a look so we did a study we used 18 months worth of data in the zero DT options collected every 10 minutes we considered selling zero DT triangles 102 and $30 out of the money not Deltas out of the money we then okay because this is kind of the key we then examined the change and implied volatility as measured by the implied volatility from Market open until noon we contrast to the performance of IB being up or down note that",
  "the performance of IB being up or down note that due to price or IV anti-correlation this is very similar to asking if the market is up or down does that make sense to you it does okay and the reason that we said this is because there are when you think about volatility okay if volatility goes up the Market's going down if volatility goes down the Market's going up so it is reasonable to assume that when you look at this study today if you look at volatility you can also assume which way the",
  "at volatility you can also assume which way the Market's going okay meaning that if the Market's going if these positions work better when volatil is Contracting then you want an up Market okay I say that a lot when I do my podcast on what you think volatility is going to do is going to influence the position that you put on too for sure okay just looking to see if there's anything crazy here I don't see it so let's continue with this slide all right so a bunch of stuff here Beth and there's a",
  "right so a bunch of stuff here Beth and there's a lot of stuff on these slides and remember these are 10 20 and $30 wide strangles and the difference here is that you close it early in the day or you roll it okay you just adjust it and you can see that after you look at these slides you're kind of think angles in we've talked about this zero dat they use a lot of buying power so I know they're not buying the wings but we would typically buy the wing you could sure but what's important here is",
  "wing you could sure but what's important here is they don't put the definition of rolled here I just want to make sure rolled means you are adjusting the position right not rolling it to the next day you ain't going anywhere you're not going to the next day though you're just okay you're just adjusting the position all right go ahead Beth go to the next slide you go based on the strangles and you close them I think you close them based on success we do the 20 and $30 wide so 91 and 94 when you",
  "we do the 20 and $30 wide so 91 and 94 when you look at the a because those numbers are just too high they're too high not to do it the average daily p&l I mean when you start to look here at the $20 wide strangles where we live here it it totally makes sense C bars same across the board when you roll these things hold to the end of the day the the results aren't worth it just close it and move on simple the numbers the numbers literally with everything that we've found I mean you're going to",
  "that we've found I mean you're going to have a lot more risk bringing it into the later hours of the day too these numbers speak for themselves just put the position on close them out that's your best play don't roll them don't don't get too cute unless you have you roll them if you have to not not not because you're doing it offensively the Sears pretty much stays the same when we look at this this is when implied volatility no that's overall okay good perfect that's it regardless of implied",
  "okay good perfect that's it regardless of implied volatility now we're looking at this implied volatility contracts so when implied volatility cont tracks the other side to that is that this is Market going higher Okay so the Market's going higher your win rate is really high I'm looking at the middle one the 20 Delta closed triangles that's the one I've highlighted 20 Delta wide not sorry 20 wide strangles $20 outside the money basically $20 away from the at the money strangles I'm looking at",
  "from the at the money strangles I'm looking at this the win rate I'm looking at the average daily p&l okay even if you adjust it still makes a little money and and not that to the $30 wide it's not bad either it's still solid the $30 wide but I'm just losing the 20 cuz we tend to be at the 20 those numbers work this is when the market goes higher and implied volatility contracts do the $10 wide you actually when you're when you're when you're rolling it becomes a negative just too close to the",
  "it becomes a negative just too close to the money so you ins you got to be wide inside the expected move and this is when IV expands now this is gets a little scary because you don't know what's going to happen and usually in the first hour like today first couple of hours you had you had the market higher now you have it obviously lower but take a look at these numbers when IV expands inra day this is why we don't like holding things to the this is why we don't like holding things in general",
  "is why we don't like holding things in general because you don't know when the Market's turn around there's no positive number here this is when the market turns around and goes down this is what makes zero DT so hard because when the market goes down due to the velocity of change meaning the velocity of the movement to the downside and also due to the IV expansion and today is a perfect example as the vix is was down this morning now it's up 25 CS the win rate drops from low 90s to 70% the",
  "25 CS the win rate drops from low 90s to 70% the average daily p&l gets crushed totally crushed and this is why I'm going to point out a couple things here this is why I only like to do zero days when IV is really high to start with because when IV is low you run the risk of IV expansion you run the risk of acceleration to the downside and there's no juice there to make up for it when when you have a market that is let's call it 50/50 to go up or down or 55 45 whatever it is to go up or down",
  "or down or 55 45 whatever it is to go up or down down the numbers still don't play out even with a 94% or 92% probability of profit the numbers don't play out to do zero days in low implied volatility they just don't play out well you're flirting yeah and it's now if you put this on on a big down opening maybe that plays out a little bit better because maybe volatility cont tracks over the course of the day if it comes back a little bit but I don't know and we really wanted to do this because I",
  "know and we really wanted to do this because I wanted to show the difference between up markets and down markets changes in intraday implied volatility seem to heavily and anti-correlate with short premium Zero D success so as long as IV fell during the day the short premium trades tended to be winners or the short premium zero DT trades when Ivy expanded from open to noon the zero DT trades were often unsuccessful those was pretty obvious the key if you managed to have a winning trade despite",
  "if you managed to have a winning trade despite IV expanding take your profits and be happy rolling to new strikes was a recipe for snatching defeat from the jaws of Victory essentially here this is making a very strong argument that one of the reasons that zero DT trades have been for some people so successful over the last 18 months year and a half is because the Market's been going higher I I don't want to burst anybody's bubble but a phenomenon of the market accommodating right which we've",
  "of the market accommodating right which we've always said in these zero days you and I have always said this yes there is there is no question that a market that grinds higher is the best case scenario for zero DT trades if you have a market that is grinding lower or going lower zero DT trades become very difficult to be profitable with so let's not not confuse those two"
