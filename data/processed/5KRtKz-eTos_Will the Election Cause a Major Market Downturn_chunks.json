  "Today, we will discuss the months leading up to the elections in August, September, and October. Is there a trend to be aware of during this time? Some sayings in the market suggest buying Russia and selling Yam Kapoor, while others suggest the opposite. These sayings have not been tested or proven to be true.",
  "October has historically been a volatile month for trading. It is unpredictable and may not follow any specific trend. It is important to be cautious and prepared for potential fluctuations in the market during this time.",
  "history, market activity has rarely been directly influenced by elections. In 1987, the crash occurred in October with no election impact. In 1989, the mini crash also happened in October, with elections looming but not significantly affecting the market. In 2008, the market was already in a meltdown, making it an election-related event. In 2016, the market saw a significant increase after the election.",
  "The market ran up after the 2016 election but was weak in October. In an election year, implied volatilities remain average with an overstatement rate of 86% over the last 12 months. Here is the S&P historical volatility and implied volatility. The implied volatility has generally overstated.",
  "The implied volatility is typically overstated. We should expect price and implied volatility to increase leading up to a presidential election. August and September were typical compared to past election years. Volatility in 2020 is higher than in previous years.",
  "In 2000, we analyzed the SPX and the VIX, focusing on August, September, and October in presidential election years (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020). We calculated historical volatility, implied volatility, price changes, and monthly price variations, comparing them to non-election years.",
  "In non-election years, August and September tend to have average implied volatility but low historical volatility. This suggests that price volatility is muted despite an upcoming election. In election years, October tends to be more volatile than August and September.",
  "In 2008, October saw a significant increase in volatility, reaching almost 80. This outlier may have skewed historical numbers. Despite this, normal election-year implied average volatility remains in line with historical levels.",
  "2008 skewed the actual average monthly price variation. The average price changes leading up to the election show a strong bullish August and very bearish September and October. However, the variation is large, indicating no statistical evidence for directional trends.",
  "August tends to be bullish, while September and October are typically bearish since 2000. Monthly price variations show that August and September are more volatile in non-election years compared to election years. In non-election years, October is less volatile.",
  "October was less volatile compared to August and September, even in election years. The difference in volatility between these months is insignificant. In non-election years, there is basically no change. This suggests that economic factors may have a greater impact on trading than election years.",
  "Price variation is larger than the average size, indicating no directional trend in any month. We conducted a study on non-election years since 2000, comparing average monthly price changes and variations. The results show no significant differences from previous takeaways.",
  "The study found that implied volatility expectations for August and September were not significantly impacted by the upcoming election. These results suggest that trading strategies should remain unchanged despite the election.",
  "Trading during an election year can be more volatile, especially in October. The capitulation in 2008 had a significant impact on trading patterns during that month. However, there are no consistent directional trends in any month, regardless of an election."
