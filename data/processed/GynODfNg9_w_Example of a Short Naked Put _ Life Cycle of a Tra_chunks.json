  "what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video we are going to cover a naked [Music] put what's up everyone we're going to make a couple trades here for the Johnny Trader portfolio I like to go to the S&P 100 list just to see what's moving you can see a lot of the chip names to the upside on the downside it's a little bit of a mixed bag you got some of the um payment",
  "bit of a mixed bag you got some of the um payment processors MasterCard Visa you got Target on there cat uh Adobe FedEx um looking for a couple positions here in this portfolio I'm trying to find some stocks that are in the 50 to $100 range so that I can sell some naked premium here with our expirations now currently around that 30 to 40-day time frame um so one of the names that came up in my search was Shopify uh shop trading currently at 66 you got an iv rank of 69 so very high there uh it's",
  "got an iv rank of 69 so very high there uh it's traded pretty range bound over the last couple weeks it's had the a pretty wide range over the last um couple months here and into the last year but it's trading at kind of the lower end of where it's been been trading so I'm going to look to do uh naked put here in Shopify so we'll go to the August expiration it does have earnings coming up somewhere within the expiration which I'm okay with given that um pretty much everything has earnings",
  "given that um pretty much everything has earnings coming up so I'm going to go to the August expiration here I'd like to go somewhere around the 20 to 30 Delta for my short puts so looking at this strike it'd be the 60 UH 60 strike put trading at $2 and change it uses about 700 bucks in buying power so it's at the higher end of my my typical range uh but I'm okay with that given that I've got a lot of capital on the sidelines right now so I'm GNA look at this naked put here about a 25 26 27",
  "GNA look at this naked put here about a 25 26 27 Delta here very high Theta Max profit of $2 and change which is my credit using about 700 bucks in buying power I'll look to manage this trade $50 to $100 profit would be my ideal range here over the next couple weeks so we'll put this order in at 212 here right at the mid price see if we get filled there we are what's up everyone we are back with a closing order on a shop naked put that we put on just last week here on the 10th you can see on",
  "on just last week here on the 10th you can see on the right side of the platform here when we look at the order chains we can see we sold this on uh July 10th we sold it at $212 if we right click you can pull up The View Market snapshots just to give you an idea of where we sold that put we sold the put when the stock was trading at 66 it's now trading at 69 so it's at about a five or6 uh price movement to the upside which is great IV rank has actually expanded into this up move we can look at",
  "expanded into this up move we can look at uh the Delta of the option was about a 26 Delta at that time uh we've had this nice little rally here and this option has gone from $212 down to to a149 so it's about a uh marked $63 profit just about 30 40% of the max profit here in just under a week so I think it's time to close this trade out we'll go and open up the August expiration we can see the Delta we've lost about eight Deltas on this trade because of this up move uh that's why the option is",
  "of this up move uh that's why the option is much cheaper right now so we go to buy the option we would click the ask which is to buy the option that we are short here we've got it here at a do 50 is the mid price uh the 60 strike put if we get filled here it' be a $62 profit see if we can get filled there it is a $150 closing order on that short naked put nice move in the stock which helped us significantly here uh $62 about 30% of the max profit on just a couple 100 bucks in buying power so",
  "on just a couple 100 bucks in buying power so nice return on Capital there another good trade there in the books for our Johnny Trad portfolio if you want to catch these trades live tune in to Johnny trades every Wednesday at 9:40 a.m. on tasty live peace [Music]"
