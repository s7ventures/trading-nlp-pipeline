  "Risk on and risk off are determined by volatility expansion and contraction. Risk on means taking more risk, buying stocks, and possibly riskier stocks.",
  "Buying stocks typically involves purchasing riskier growth stocks, while taking a risk-off approach involves moving money to safer, more conservative assets such as defensive stocks."
