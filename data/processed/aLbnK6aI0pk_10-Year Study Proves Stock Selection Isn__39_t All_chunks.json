  "In our research, we emphasize focusing on strategies over individual products. In liquid markets, controllable elements across products are implied volatility of notional value, rather than unpredictable price movements.",
  "In trading, focus on what you can control. This includes your strategy, strike selection, and duration. You cannot control the stock's performance in the short term.",
  "Select the duration and manage current level volatility. Focus on what you can control, such as entry and exit points. This segment demonstrates applying a strategic mindset to trading liquid products.",
  "Liquid products are important for efficient derivatives pricing across asset classes. Prioritizing strategy over product is key. A study was conducted on four underlying assets over 10 years, with various options strategies tested.",
  "In a separate test, we analyzed a 30 Delta put 45 days to expiration, managing in 21 days. The short put has performed well since 2014, with a high win rate and average profit as a percentage of premium collected. To validate our claim of strategy over product indifference, we need to see consistent results in average P&L as a percentage of buying power.",
  "For valid results, the win rates, average profit size, percent of premium, and worst loss per premium should be similar across all underlyings. Normalizing profit and loss as a percent of premium collected accounts for differences in implied volatility and notional value.",
  "Implied volatility and notional differences impact the study. Win rates range from 70-73% for the 16 Delta triangle strategy, with average profits of 7-10% of buying power and average losses of 9-15 times. Average P&L ranges from 310-510% of buying power, validating the concept.",
  "The strategy of choosing strategy over product was validated through trading various assets such as bonds and gold. Despite variations from year to year, factors such as win rate, average profit as a percent of Premium, worst loss, and average P&L as a percent of buying power remained consistent.",
  "On August 5th, there was a difference in TLT and gold prices. In 2025, the strategy is more important than predicting direction. Selling a short put typically results in win rates between 73-77% and average profits of 16-21%.",
  "average profit between 16-21% due to the bullish market conditions. Win rates are consistently high at 77-73%. Average profit as a percent of premium is also higher. Worst losses are similar due to one big down move. Average P&L as a percent of buying power is significantly higher at 1-2%.",
  "The returns on selling puts in a bull market ranged from 1% to 2%. The assets studied (SPY, QQQ, TLT, gold) showed similar results. Prioritizing strategies over individual products is key, despite differences in prices, volatilities, and correlations.",
  "Implied volatilities, correlations, and market exposures affect selling premium with a fixed Delta on all assets. Win rates, average profits, and average losses differ by only a small percentage across all underlyings. Focus on controlling what you can, optimizing mechanics, and following the most optimal strategy. Don't worry about the underlying product.",
  "underlying product. It is important to focus on strategy over individual products when trading and select underlying assets based on preferred notional size, implied volatility, correlation, and liquidity. The long-term profitability of a trade is more dependent on strategy than the specific underlying product.",
  "When applying the same trading strategy to four different underlying asset classes with distinct characteristics, the profitability metrics were consistently similar."
