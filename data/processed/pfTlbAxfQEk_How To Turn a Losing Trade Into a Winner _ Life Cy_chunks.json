  "what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade management and closing order in this video we are going to cover a [Music] strangle today I am looking for a position in DraftKings so DraftKings 38 IV rank it's had a nice little rally here back it's stayed pretty range-bound over the last couple months if not year uh and has high implied volatility it's a stock that I gravitate toward a lot in this portfolio in",
  "I gravitate toward a lot in this portfolio in my own portfolio it's a product I use myself so I like uh to trade in DraftKings as just a a user I like to have a position on there but really the the key to this underlying and to one of the reasons why I love trading it is that it constantly has high implied volatility you can see the IV the actual raw implied volatility is about 55% which is a high volatility it basically means that the stock is projected based on the option prices to either go",
  "projected based on the option prices to either go up 50% or go down 50% over the course of a year so it has very high implied volatility you can see it does have P some decent price action but nowhere near 50% to either side that would be that would mean 55 on the upside or or uh you know 20 on the downside we are well inside that that expectation and so it means that the premium here is pretty high Ivy rank at 37 on the higher end that we see right now um so I think it warrants a position so",
  "right now um so I think it warrants a position so I'm going to go to October the 37 day you know we typically look to go somewhere between 30 and 50 days to go till expiration the reason we picked the 37 the October uh 18th expiration is because it's the monthly expiration and you can see it highlighted as a more uh vibrant blue here uh the monthly expirations when we look at the bit asp in the volume just to go through some of the things that I look at volume relatively low we just opened this",
  "look at volume relatively low we just opened this morning but you can see that the open interest on these options is very very high uh in a in the Thousand handle you know couple hundreds couple thousands on each of those strikes when you go into a weekly and and also the bid ass spreads right so we have Penny wide couple pennies wide on either either strikes when you go into the weeklys you'll see much less volume of course you'll see much less open interest you only got a handful of of",
  "less open interest you only got a handful of of options traded but you'll also see really wide bid ass spreads so these bid ass spreads 20 cents wide 30 cents wide some of these are dollar wide what that means is is that the prices here for these options I is much wider it's not as easy to buy and sell at mostly the same price as it is with the uh monthly expiration so here you might sell to open an option at the 33 strike at 80 2 but when you go to buy it back it might trade at A110 and that's",
  "to buy it back it might trade at A110 and that's because these these markets are wide there's not much volume there's not much open interest and so the the prices are not as tight we're always looking for tight bid ass spreads because it allows us to get in and out of positions at a relatively fair price because you can buy and sell at relatively the same value here it is not the case so uh with DraftKings we're going to go to that October monthly of course you can see Penny wide markets couple",
  "of course you can see Penny wide markets couple pennies wide here uh that's pretty normal so I'm going to look for a strangle here get some short premium on I typically like to go somewhere between a 20 and 30 Delta for me personally from just a capital uses usage standpoint I like to sell at least a dollar uh of Premium on the positions that I'm I'm taking so for me I would lean towards like this 34 strike at a 26 Delta on the upside same sort of thing I want to collect about a dollar maybe",
  "of thing I want to collect about a dollar maybe lean a little bit short the stock has rallied pretty significantly over the last couple weeks you do have football season starting maybe that's a reason um so I'm going to lean into this 40 strike call here and do the whole package at $2 and change you could see another great thing about this stock and stocks in this realm low stock price so it's in the 30 handle 36 and change here uh High implied volatility which means it's expected to move a lot",
  "which means it's expected to move a lot but the capital requirement relative to how much premium you're you're getting here is very very low so when you think about this from a potential return on Capital standpoint it's almost a 50% return on Capital just getting filled at $2 and change on $400 in buying power the caveat is of course that buying power can and usually will change as time passes and if one of these options goes in the money it can certainly change there so um it is something to",
  "certainly change there so um it is something to keep in mind but this as a as a good beginner type stock to put a position on uh doesn't use a ton of capital has high implied volatility definitely gives you opportunities to trade this and you can see I've traded it before uh for decent success so we're going to try try and Route this at 216 see if we get filled no fill there cancel and replace that no 215 let's see if we can get 214 all right so we're in for 214 on that strangle we are short",
  "so we're in for 214 on that strangle we are short the 3440 strangle in the October monthly expiration all right so we've got an adjustment to make in our draft King strangle uh today DraftKings busting through the 40 handle it's had a nice little rally up we put put this position on on the 11th uh $214 credit for a delta neutral strangle we were doing the 3440 strangle if we take a look at the market snapshots if you right click on that you can see the stock was trading about 37 so we were two",
  "see the stock was trading about 37 so we were two or $ three do on either side of the stock at that time the stock has rallied about 4 and a half to5 since then so it's been a very quick rally to the upside uh we had that Delta neutral strangle that strangle now if we go to the table here in October is currently in the money on the call side you could see we're we're only marked at about a 50 c 60 C loser at the moment G even into such a big move in the stock I mean the Stock's up 10 11 12%",
  "move in the stock I mean the Stock's up 10 11 12% since that time frame uh at this point so we've got 23 days to go till expiration we could consider rolling this out in time to the November expiration it does look like it's projected to have earnings coming up uh in the in the early part of November it's not yet confirmed yet though you'll see a little bell here if it is confirmed but just given that volatility is 57% versus 43% in the front October expiration it tells you that there's",
  "October expiration it tells you that there's probably something happening here so the earnings are kind of baked into that expiration so I'm going to try to avoid the earnings for now and just roll up the put I'm going to roll the straddle here the 40 strike uh put here so I'll have the 40 straddle if I do this for a dollar and change it'll put me at about a $3 and change total credit on the position which which would move my break even all the way up to 43 is 43 in change and to the downside",
  "way up to 43 is 43 in change and to the downside 37 in change so um and collect another you know dollar so so if we sit here at this price it'll be another dollar that I can capture over the next um couple weeks here so we're going to make this roll up we're going to try it at 104 and see if we get filled here no fill we'll put this at 103 all right so we got filled at 103 you can see the order chains update with that full and new position all the adjustments that we've done the opening order",
  "the adjustments that we've done the opening order and then the new adjustment here average trade price because we only have one contract here 317 it's currently marked at 3 374 so I'm out about $55 on the trade right now I have this 40 straddle if we continue higher over the next week or two I'll probably look to take this out to November uh it depends on where the stock is at that point but I can either take it as a straddle or buy the guts and sell the wings as we've talked about before where",
  "sell the wings as we've talked about before where you buy the at the money premium the at the money straddle sell a out-of- the- money strangle and try to do it for a small credit just to kind of move your break even points uh but it depends on where the stock is it depends on what happens with volatility here maybe a cut gets a little bit of a pullback that would help this position maybe I'm able to exit for a profit we'll see over the next couple weeks uh if we can get some sideways action",
  "weeks uh if we can get some sideways action here to roll uh this position out to November we have this uh DraftKings position which we put on on the 11th so it's been about a month uh this trade has gone in directions here so you've had a little bit of a of a sell off so if we look at the 11th here we were trading at about 36 I actually had a little bit of a rally then a little bit of a sell-off we're kind of right back to where we've started we've rolled up the put spread so you can see uh or",
  "rolled up the put spread so you can see uh or I'm sorry we rolled up the put 34 to the 40 strike we did that for a dollar credit our total credit is 317 marked at 309 gives us a total p&l basically of a scratch here up just a couple pennies now the position itself the 40 straddle which we rolled up into the bigger up move here so on the 25th uh which was right here stock was at 41 Stock's now down $4 from when we rolled up that put uh it hasn't really hurt us all that much that put we rolled up",
  "hurt us all that much that put we rolled up for a dollar it cost us probably about a hundred bucks on that roll up here but at this point we only have about 60 cents more EX iic value to get out of this position so with 10 days to go till expiration the position is trading at $3 and change if we look at where the stock is right now at 2751 the position marked at $3 if the stock were to stay here we this position would trade down to $2.50 because this put would be $2.50 in the money the call",
  "this put would be $2.50 in the money the call would expire worthless and so we really only have 50 cents more of value 506 cents more of value to get out of this position in terms of of of where the extrinsic value is right now now if the stock were to Rally to 40 these options would both have very minimal extrinsic value at expiration and thus it could be a much bigger uh win if that were to happen but we don't know if that's going to happen or not it's not something we can play for here so",
  "or not it's not something we can play for here so instead of playing for that we're just going to take this position and roll this out to November now it does look there there will be earnings coming up at some point here it does look like it's somewhere in the these three expirations so November 1 through the 15th I'm not concerned about that I don't really that's not something that I'm worried about I want to lean a little bit directionally long here uh up to this 40 handle so I'm just going",
  "here uh up to this 40 handle so I'm just going to take this position and roll it as a straddle you'll see we'll do this roll for a net $293 credit or somewhere around that you won't use any additional buying power when you roll short options short premium your risk doesn't change so you still have the same risk as you had before you're collecting premium which is reducing the overall risk of the position and giving yourself more potential value to capture but the risk itself you're rolling",
  "to capture but the risk itself you're rolling forward that risk and so you're not adding any additional risk here um the position will lean directionally long so you could see we're actually taking off um some Deltas here with this roll because we are selling uh meteor options here so we'll only have 20 long Deltas as opposed to 60 when you look at the Deltas here will be short 40 Deltas long 60 Deltas net 20 Deltas long so it does reduce some of our directional exposure we don't need as much",
  "of our directional exposure we don't need as much of an up move as we do in the 10day all those things are good things and it's time to roll I've been waiting on this position for quite some time so we're going to make this roll see if we can get 29 5 and then we'll um check out how our order chains look put this down to 293 come on no fill there put this down a [Music] penny no fill there they're really trying to squeeze [Music] me 290 there so we got filled at $22.90 credit on this roll to",
  "so we got filled at $22.90 credit on this roll to the 40 stradle we're out in November now our net credit is going to be $6.7 which means that our break even at expiration in the next 38 days is going to be $6 below the 40 strike put so that puts us at about 34 $6 above the call at 56 anywhere in that range should be a a decent profit for for us over the next 30 some OD days here so um just managing that strangled to a straddle now I'm rolling out in time I could have rolled out and adjusted",
  "out in time I could have rolled out and adjusted the strikes if I wanted to but I chose to lean a little bit directional and be at that 40 strike straddle so we'll see if that works out over the next couple weeks all right so we've got a position to manage here we have a closing order for our DraftKings position so we've got em mini S&P 500 futures up 100 points this morning uh we had the elections last night a lot of volatility getting uh pulled out of this Market here with the volatility",
  "out of this Market here with the volatility Futures down almost 7% to start the session we've had this DraftKings position on this uh straddle at the 40 strike which we started as a strangle we rolled up the puts and then we rolled out in time from nove from October to November we've done all these adjustments for a $67 net credit it's currently marked at $458 going into earnings uh tomorrow after the close so uh this move today up a167 a little over 4% is about as good as it gets for us in",
  "over 4% is about as good as it gets for us in terms of this position so we've had this position on since September 11th which is right around this area right here 34 35ish we leaned a little bit long stock went all the way up to 43 all the way back down to 36 and is right back in the middle of that range exactly where we needed to be here for some profit so we're going to take the money and run on this maybe we'll take this and roll into a new position in another video so we're going to close",
  "position in another video so we're going to close out this position $151 in in uh profit on this if we can get filled here at 456 no fill there we'll adjust this down to 154 4 I'm sorry 454 453 oh we got to go up little bit of a brain fart there we're going to go up here 258 or 458 see if we get filled there all right we got filled at 460 here nice trade for us in the Johnny portfolio $147 profit very very high return on Capital given that it only uses you know couple hundred I think it was5 or",
  "uses you know couple hundred I think it was5 or $600 in total buying power on that position so a nice little trade uh for us Johnny's"
