welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the B patista and I have a trade idea for you today October 3rd 2024 right here at downtown Chicago right here in the backat cave let's see what we can find in this market even S&P is down $1750 NASDAQ down $37.50 Russell down 19 that's a 1% almost 1% move of the Russell it's the weakest of the group and then the Dow is down 250 uh the second weakest of the four now here's where things get a little bit different for me you basically have a slightly lower opening here on the market &ps trading 5742 just off of their highs by you know a couple of 50 handles or so and yet volatility is really up ticking up to 90 cents just now just traded up to 2125 which leads me to believe that volatility is starting to go a little bit higher that maybe we're going to have a a little bit more weakness in this market that's just my opinion so I'm going to stick away from the equities everything on the podcast I've done so far over the last couple of Trades um has been to try to take advantage of you know volatility expanding like we did in Iron Condor the volatility would have hurt us if it expanded um I did a a 1x3 ratio spread in Buu which has really been a pain in the uh a pain in you don't wear where the sun doesn't shine uh on us I'm out about about a dollar and a half on that trade now left with the 100 uh1 20 strangle after having a 1x3 uh call ratio spread on with the 110 120 I I really went I mean I really had to defend this I mean when we put this trade on in bu and you could see all of these trades I have it on for around $6 or so R A bucking change um you could see all of these Trad in Buu if I put it up here for you B I duu uh on the follow page so you can follow along where we where we did these trades look at this I did this uh back on uh 1026 and if you click on it to duplicate a trade we did it a170 um it's trading at 661 so yes I am out about a dollar and a half on this trade but had we done nothing we would have been out almost $45 on this trade so sometimes the adjustments help you but don't help you not enough what are we going to look at today since I think the Market's going a little bit lower I'm going stay away from uh the equity markets at all I'm going to go into oil that's forward slcl and if you take a look at oil here uh oil's really been bouncing around it's had a 4-day rally from 67 uh to where it is right now 7312 just off of its highs today of $73.95 I put this trade on when oil was up lower than $3 so you're going to be able to do even better than I but let's take a look at oil before you click the button make sure you know what the product is that you are trading now oil is the oil Futures these are barrels of oil no stock or any else here they do have span margining which is really um different if you're not used to um trading span margining with Futures options so I will go through it with you uh quickly but I will I will do it with you as best uh that I can let's take a look at what I'm looking to do in oil so um I know there's tension of the Middle East I think it's all play into the market I know they're bombing everywhere I get it uh buy the rumor sell the news is the way I like to trade but I'm going to go far out here I'm going to go all the way first of all I go to November with 43 days um same mechanics we like to put on trades around 45 days I know the monthly applied volatility in November is 50 I know the product is Trading 5256 which is about 60 cents or so lower than where the front month is trading but the front month will go away in about a week or so and then this will be the front month uh the front month will have a uh uh the contract instead of it being uh X4 will be uh will be uh Z4 you'll see Z4 for the front month when it changes but the options are already priced and expire to these Futures let's take a look at November 43 days I know the monthly apply volatility is 50 in here I know the monthly apply volatility is closer to 60 shorter dated but I like time to be right on this trade not time to be wrong on this trade so I'm going to go far out with a ratio spread here I'm going to buy the 15ish Delta option you'll notice right here that the Delta uh is 15 I don't know why I have two in the money columns here I'll get rid of that on the next podcast I apologize um but you could change these to whatever you want let's change them to um I let's change it to open interest if you want to look at open interest let's look at open interest you'll see there's plenty of open open interest thousands and th thousands of open interest I'm going to buy the 90 call which if I'm going to do a ratio spread I'm slightly bearish on oil if I do a call ratio spread at least that's the way I like to do it I'm going to buy the 90 call I'm going to go as wide as I can to collect a credit I'm going to go up to 97 and half now I did this trade for30 which is really $300 in credit it's now trading for $340 in credit think of Cl as um uh a um like SPX CL is like SPX it's 10 times the size of what you're really used to seeing this is not a dollar five or a do six it's actually a th000 and 50 uh this isn't 70 it's actually 700 so we're doing this the mid price right now is 33 Cent credit 33 Cent Credit Now if oil continues to go higher uh since you're selling an extra call here because we're doing this one buying one of the '90s selling two of the 97 and a halves we're doing it for a net credit of 33 cents I was able to get filled one penny off of mid price that's pretty typical of uh of these uh oil related products and uh these Futures options across the board what I like to look at you'll notice here that there's 2cent wide Market in the 90 calls now it's 3 cents 3 Cent wide on the market here on the 97 half calls so this mid price is going to be pretty accurate soon as it goes 2 cents to 3 cents it gets a little bit skewed 3 cents 3 cents 2 cents 2 cents mid price is fairly accurate so if you're trading a Futures option or any option that has a very wide Market on one a very tight Market on the other be careful with your mid price go in above mid price uh and and try to walk the order down I would expect it to get filled at 32 or 31 cents now vola now uh the products is going a little bit lower you can see how this moves so this will move around and it when it moves it moves a lot and look look the buying power I have this in an IRA account just to show you that you can do this spread in an IRA account it uses $3,700 in buying power now a lot of spreads that we do you know on my show use around $5,000 in buying power so it us it less but I'm going to get that's a caveat please don't click the button on another trade that you might like because you like the buying power because buying power with span margining can change let's just look at this trade first it says a 99% pop well our break even is well above 105 on this trade uh oil hasn't been over 105 that I can remember so my break even would mean that we'd have to make new highs again in 45 days I don't want that to happen just like I didn't want bu to go higher I'm sure we'll sell puts or do other things like that to adjust our Delta on this trade you can see the Delta is actually minimal uh right now it's 0.005 but again times that by 10 because that would give you the real Delta so there is a little bit of Delta on the short side to this that's why I'm bearish um on this product that's why I'm putting on this type of trade other Theta is around $25 a day in data Decay decent dat uh Decay there and you're looking at $ 33700 in buying power let me move this $75 wide spread closer to at the money so I can show you how this buying power changes now if you're doing this trade in a regular margin account you'll use about half you use around $2,000 in buying power maybe $1,800 uh in buying power if you're doing this in a margin account you're doing an IRA account $3,700 yes you can do this trade in an IRA account account okay let me move it closer to at the money where the where the product is trading you can see it's trading at $72.40 just for the EAS the math I'm going to go and buy the 70 I'm going to sell the 775 1 by two here and when you look at that uh it's a 14 Cent debit just to show you how much that product is going to move If It Moves In a very uh quick period of time here look at the buying power it's $110,000 so this will move the buying power will move move as the product gets closer to at the money and when the product um is is uh getting closer to expiration and it's closer to add the money so there's two ways this buying power can move in here I would expect that around this $10,000 would be about as high as it would go because we're looking at it right at the money uh spread so this this buying power can triple if you are using a regular margin account it' be around $5,100 it's half it' be around $5,100 so this is a very very big product with a lot of little nuances to it um and I hope that I helped you learn a little bit about Futures options and the margin or span margining uh that they use on on these products could be very helpful for using leverage uh for getting very big what would be uh for getting very big or very small contract so if you're if you're used to doing one contract spy spreads or ratio spreads 1 by two this would be 10 times the side it'd be like doing 10 by 20 this would not be in my opinion suitable for you to do even though the buying power is quite low or inside your buying power threshold because it can expand to double what you would be used to $5,000 over $10,000 and plus the numbers get very big so this is for the larger Traders I've been doing a couple of smaller trades with iron Condors this one's for the larger Traders I did mine for a 30 Cent credit I think you can do yours for a 32 or 33 uh Cent credit yes you can do this in an IRA account uh no matter well as long as you're at tasty trade I
