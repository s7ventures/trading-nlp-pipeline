we're calling this one breaking the volatility code speed matters more than size let's see where the team's going with this one so recently we've seen certain stocks we're going to as an example today we're going to use Nvidia make some huge outlier moves these types of moves are generally bad for short premium trades and of of course they are you know when when a stock like Nvidia drops from near 15 50 to near 120 it's pretty hard to defend that move of $30 when the expected move over that period of time it's closer to 15 you know that's the challenge two times the expected move and as you can see on the right hand slide there you know the volatility in Nvidia just popped up and so you have a double whammy going on stock moving outside the expected move and volatility expanding and when you're short premium uh no bueno on that little combin there that's where you get that's where I get into trouble Chris that's those are my nightmare scenarios let's go next slide Beth that's the double tap as we call it right you're short the puts and then all of a sudden the market sells off with a V expansion so the outlier moves in Nvidia caused Monday just this most recent Monday caused the V Spike to 72 from 48 um of the previous trading day with an expected move range is shown below um you know obviously we're using Nvidia here because the simplest way to say why do you choose Nvidia um well we could choose it because it's a$ three and. half trillion dollar stock but we can also choose it because it had the most option volume um by a lot I think I think there was one day last week where we did 10 million Nvidia contracts industrywide 10 million you know I first started this business we were doing a million contracts a day it was a lot now we're doing 10 million contracts in in Nidia and I the yesterday I think we did five or 6 million Nvidia or 7 million some crazy numbers that's why we chose it let's go next slide Beth so with an ivy rank of 54 and a March 21st that's that's regular March expiration 30 Delta strangle of $10.45 using only 5,500 mine power now if you have a March 30 Delta strangle of 1050 you know you can understand why a $30 move will mess you up with more than a 60% um win rate that's a that's a derivative of black schs that number so it may seem like a tempting trade to put on however we need to make sure we are considering all risks as well now one thing to note here Chris first of all nothing is mispriced let's be very clear about this nothing is mispriced nothing is ever mispriced and the other thing is when we talk about these kind of Trades the one way to defend yourself to protect yourself is or protect against a $30 move in Nvidia is just to stay small that's your way that's what you can control let's go to next slide so at first glance a short strangle in Nvidia seems to have a typical risk reward profile since implied volatility has overstated historical volatility on average we included the spies and the cu's IV and HV for reference as well this also has to do with the conversation we were having before when Julia was on the show this morning but just to give you some kind of comparison um average implied volatility which is forward-looking expected in the qes was 23 the actual historical 20 spy again 3% difference and um between 18 and 15 and Nvidia a little bit less 49 to 47 if you looked at this you'd say okay the risk reward profile is pretty similar across the board similar across the board but also in line with the understanding that IVs typically overstate the historical volatility so nothing really unusual there not nothing at all just wanted to show you that it compares to what it looks like in the ETFs as well let's go to the the next slide Beth however when digging deeper it seems like the number of outlier moves as well as the magnitude of the outlier moves in Nvidia and the Diversified indexes were nearly identical who would have thought that see this is where I get messed up I look at something like Nvidia and I'm like there is no way that the daily moves that exceed two standard deviations which have less than a 5% chance of happening would be the same in Nvidia and spy and q's since 2017 like this is the slide that messes me up the most because I never I've been trading Nvidia and it feels like all the outlier moves are in Nvidia It Feels Like Only outlier moves exist in Nvidia yes Gad sent this over right when Gad sent this over I said wow that's that's shocking but that goes on to the bigger Point here about the idiosyncratic risk and trading some these single stock names um it is it's it's like wild to me that that that the spy and qes have almost the exact same number of occurrences and the average um s deviation move when you exceed two standard deviations wild to me let's go next slide Beth so then why does it seem for most that Nvidia is riskier to trade than the Spy The Q's if the outlier risk the number of two standard deviation moves and the overall risk the IV overstatement for both the index and Nvidia are nearly identical because they're all about the same all that's why we did this study all these numbers are the same so why does it seem like you take so much more risk when you trade Nvidia because the implied volatility is higher I mean I'm just you know throwing it out there let's go next SL throwing it out there to M well I think we're going to find out the answer and the answer lies in the velocity of implied volatility we talk about velocity a lot on this network and the reason we do is because velocity is the the velocity of risk is what we call basically is what option pricing skew is so the velocity of implied volatility this translates into how quickly implied volatility can Spike on any given day we can quantify this by looking at the average and the standard deviations of historical daily implied volatility increases um so really the answer is in how fast implied volatility can move you know Nvidia can go from 40 to 70 but it's tough for the indexes to go from 20 to 40 and that's and that's the difference let's go to next slide so when Nvidia implied volatility expands and here's the key it expands by 57% more than the spy and 60% more than the q's in addition Nvidia implied volatility has double the range of expansion potential than the QQQ IV does um so however the minimum Maxi daily increases are almost identical so this is where basically the the additional risk comes into play now you get paid for that additional risk because if you sold the same strangle in the qes the same Delta strangle you'd collect about a third of the amount of capital that's the difference so the average of the historical daily implied volatility increases is about let's call it double in Nvidia over the other ones and everything else kind of stays exactly the same except the standard deviation of historical daily volatility increases is higher that's it about 50% um showing you where the additional risk comes and why you get paid the additional money for trading underly that has higher volatility than the indices does it it's not just Nvidia right it do any stock would fit this profile just for it's not just Nvidia we just use Nvidia as an example they're all the same and this is why if you trade some of these equities you get paid more money you take more risk you get paid more money that's exactly how it works works this whole industry is theoretically on spoton but you take more risk you get paid more money let's go next slide so the reason why trading single stocks tends to be more risky and has more potential reward that's the offset than trading ETFs is due to the large potential velocity of IV expansion as shown in our studies single stocks also have a tendency to have more outliers than ETFs but in nidia's case the main risk is to be aware of its IV expansion risk that is one solid study
