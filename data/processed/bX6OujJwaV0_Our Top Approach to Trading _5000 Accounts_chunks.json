  "When aiming to gain exposure to a specific underlying, optimizing wing width and buying power is crucial. The buying power requirement of the trade is the limiting factor, allowing expensive underlyings to be tradable with any account size. Options are popular and growing rapidly due to their ability to make expensive financial products accessible.",
  "expensive now, with stocks like Tesla at $350 per share and United Airlines at $10,000 for 100 shares. Options have made financial markets more accessible in this environment.",
  "The financial markets have become more accessible in recent years, allowing anyone to trade higher-priced stocks using option strategies. You can trade stocks worth $200, $500, or even $1000 with just a couple hundred dollars by utilizing strategies like at-the-money spreads.",
  "can trade any stock with an at-the-money spread for $2.50. Buy one strike in the money and one strike out of the money for a risk of $2.50 to make $1.",
  "An at-the-money call spread for $2.50 offers a 50-50 shot to risk $2.50 and make $2.50. This study aims to optimize buying power requirements for various neutral strategies with different wing widths. Research from 2014 to 2024 compared average buying power for multiple underlying assets.",
  "power for multiple underlying with positions at 10, 16, 20, and 30 Delta Les and iron Condors with 16 Delta short strikes and long wings of 5-10 and 13 Deltas. For shorts strangles, the average buying power ranged from 19 to 23, requiring approximately 11,000 to 13,500 in buying power.",
  "To trade a strangle on Spy at $600, you will need between $11,000 and $13,500 in buying power, regardless of the Delta chosen.",
  "11,000 and 13,000 are expensive underlyings. The varying Deltas of these strategies have a small impact on buying power requirements. Strangles with expensive underlyings are generally unsuitable for smaller accounts. Wider wings in a strangle increase risk.",
  "When widening the wings of a strangle, it reduces the buffer against extreme losses. A higher ratio indicates a more secure risk profile. Going wider means a wider break-even point. Iron condors involve selling a 16 Delta short and buying the 510 and 13.",
  "A 16 Delta short and buying the 510 and 13 Delta wings creates iron Condors with lower buying power requirements. An iron Condor would require between $600 and $4700 in buying power if the Spy was trading at the same price. This makes it more appropriate for expensive underlyings and smaller accounts.",
  "136 strike is narrow compared to wider strangles or triangles. The average buying power as a percent of the underlying price is 8-3 times depending on the width of the wings, ranging between $600 and $4,700.",
  "strangle, it can have a larger impact on the buying power of the trade. The long Delta for an iron condor is crucial in this context.",
  "Choosing a different strike for the iron condor can vary the potential profit by up to 500% or even 600%. This strategy is versatile, offering high probability of profit and buying power profiles suitable for both larger and smaller accounts. Widening the wings of the iron condor increases the strike price distances, expanding the profit range.",
  "When trading options, risk is symmetrical. The amount of money you have and the level of risk you're willing to take will dictate your price selection. Larger accounts offer more flexibility compared to smaller accounts.",
  "Smaller accounts have limitations on the amount of money available for trading. Expensive underlyings can be traded with any account size, but the strategy used should be based on the total buying power of the portfolio.",
  "The size of your trades should be based on the total buying power of your portfolio. Define your risk as 1-3% for defined risk trades and 3-5% for undefined risk trades in larger accounts. For smaller accounts, risk 5-7% for defined risk trades and 5-10% for undefined risk trades. Be cautious and keep risk numbers low. Avoid trading strangles with expensive underlyings in smaller accounts, regardless of Delta.",
  "For smaller accounts, widening the strikes on iron condors does not result in significant savings. The buying power requirements for iron condors are sensitive to wing width, offering a higher probability of profit and buying power requirement for larger accounts, and a lower probability of profit and buying power requirement for smaller accounts."
