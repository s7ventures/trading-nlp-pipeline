how best can we hedge against a Black Swan event this is the age-old question I mean I think if you stick to the mechanics being in positions with 45 days on Entry closing around 21 days or rolling around 21 days giving yourself time to be right there's one way to hedge and that's to stay small that's it there's no way to get short enough Delta there's no way to have enough puts there's no way to know when to get out of that stuff so the answer is Tony's right there's nothing you can do to hedge against the Black Swan event that doesn't even exist anybody that thinks that that exists it's just you're living in la la land it does not exist but if you keep your position size small you're hedging against a black SW event
