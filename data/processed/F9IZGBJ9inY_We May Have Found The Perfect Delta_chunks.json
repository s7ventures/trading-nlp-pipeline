  "When trading options, a Delta of around 20 is ideal. Selling a put and call with 20 Deltas each gives a theoretical probability of 60% and an actual probability of 71%. This provides a good risk-reward balance, with a high probability of profit.",
  "Increasing the Delta decreases the probability of profit. Taking more risk can lead to higher profits."
