  "Our research team has developed a market measure to quantify risk during earnings periods. Risk is a fundamental aspect of investing, especially during earnings seasons when heightened volatility can lead to sharp price swings and uncertainty about maintaining rallies, as seen in Tesla's recent performance.",
  "market has been rallying for the past couple of days, now on day three. I don't like Tesla at the moment. Using backtesting on Tasty, we grouped stocks into four categories based on their products to analyze risk during earnings season. Looking at data from 2018 to present, we will examine a 16 Delta strangle strategy across various sectors such as tech and consumer retail.",
  "focused on these sectors. We then analyzed their risk using various metrics and compared the results. Since 2018, we have been able to track the timing of earnings announcements and assess their impact on stock volatility.",
  "Top S&P 500 stocks available in our back testing tool can be analyzed for trading opportunities. Tech and semiconductor stocks like Apple, Google, and AMD have shown a solid average win rate of 70% during earnings season.",
  "Average win rate of 70% since 2018, with high risks especially for Google. Max loss for one lot is $3600. AMD has lower volatility and appears safer. Risk-adjusted ROI is 19%, indicating decent returns with variability. Data covers six years.",
  "Looking at six years of tech stock data, selling the 16 Delta strangle has a 70% win rate with a high max loss of 19% of buying power ($1800). The risk-adjusted return on investment is also 19%.",
  "The return is 19% with a volatility of plus or minus $1,000. Consumer stocks like Nike, Amazon, and Costco have a win rate of 73%, but there were some big losses, especially in Amazon.",
  "The return on investment for these tough stocks was modest at 2%, with a volatility of P&L at 4,000. In comparison, tech stocks had a lower volatility of P&L at 1,000. This resulted in less profit and higher risk in the tough stock sector. Overall, it was not a great sector for risk-return.",
  "In analyzing entertainment stocks like Netflix, Meta, and AMC, the average win rate was higher, the average return was lower, and the risk-adjusted return on capital was 21%. Volatility in P&L was significantly lower at $1,200.",
  "P&L was only $1,200. Media stocks AMC, Netflix, and Meta outperformed technology and consumer stocks. Tesla, Boeing, and Rivian were also considered in the analysis.",
  "We have positions in Tesla, Boeing, and Rivian. Tesla is high-risk with potential high returns, Boeing is moderate risk with stable returns, and Rivian is a lower-priced, lower-risk investment. Rivian's stock price has been significantly higher over the last eight years. The volatility of profit and loss is noteworthy.",
  "The volatility of P&L was significantly higher, with a similar win rate and negative return on investment. Tesla and Boeing contributed to this negative risk-return ratio. Takeaways from the research team include the need to consider sector performance for future investments.",
  "There are sectors that have shown better performance over multiple years, with consistent returns on investment. Some sectors have remained unchanged or negative.",
  "One out of three trades had negative results, while the other two had returns around 20%. The variability of the strategies may not provide a significant reward for the risk involved. The rapid movement of strategies in a single day does not show any standout opportunities for high returns.",
  "The trading team found that these dues are a valuable engagement tool, fairly priced, and random. The research team noted a tech semiconductor and provided win rates across the board in the same category.",
  "rates in the same category have a wide range of maximum loss and spread. The tech semiconductor space was actually the least risky with the best return and lowest volatility, contrary to expectations.",
  "In our study, we quantified stock price movements during earning season and assessed the performance of defined trade strategies. This study focused on quantifying the risks associated with earnings announcements, which is essential for traders. Earning season increases investment risk due to heightened volatility, especially in more volatile sectors.",
  "In volatile sectors, stock movements depend on earnings results compared to market expectations. To manage risk, diversify portfolios, trade smaller positions, and use mental stops when necessary. The analyzed stocks are examples of our backtesting tool, categorized by products and services. Use this tool with different stocks to assess risk, reward, and volatility.",
  "have to be careful when interpreting these results as they may not always accurately reflect the true risk and reward of a trading strategy. It's important to use caution and not rely solely on backtesting results when making trading decisions.",
  "Consumer retail may seem boring compared to other industries, but it actually has less risk than tech companies. Trading is not always as straightforward as it appears."
