can you ever have a situation where the vix is high above 30 but the SPX ivr is low below 20 if so how would you trade that it happens quite fre how would I trade it I probably wouldn't be looking at indexes I'd be looking at more individual stocks usually individual stocks going to have a much higher ivr anyway the BX above 30 is very high it only gets above 30 a few times a decade when that happens the ivr is generally really high for the vix to be above 30 and the ivr to be below 20 you're going to have to have an elevated for almost a year that's only happened like one or two times in history how would you trade it well you stick to the rules about where ivr is even though the vix is high if the ivr is low there's better plays on the board you have to stick to the mechanics which basically say if the ivr is low you're going to stay away from the trade if the ivrs high you're going to get into the trade you're rarely going to have that situation I'm going to say almost never maybe we've had that situation once ever
