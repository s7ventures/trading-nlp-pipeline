welcome to option trades today I'm toy the Baptista and I have a trade idea for you today November 19th that's right 2024 but first as I always do let's see what the Market's doing &ps are up $2 doesn't seem like anything's happening today but you can see here from the high low which I like to have on here where the &ps are basically unchanged you can see that they were about 70 handles lower and 10 handles higher big range on the &ps we opened much lower than this went lower after some numbers and have rallied back since then Nasdaq doing the same up 44 Russell up 50 and the Dow is the weakest of the group down $165 volatility still up 30 when I woke up this morning with the &ps down around $20 uh volatility was up 90 cents uh volatility been staying bid all day long maybe that's because of some economic news that we have coming out later in this week but right now the market seems to be uh churning itself a little bit higher like I always like to do and bonds by the way caught a little bit of a bid they got to 11713 wiping out the last three or four days lower move but still plenty of room to the upside if you're bullish plenty of reasons to sell them if you're bearish too let's take a look at what I like to do I like to go to my watch list I like to go to High option volume list I like to change this from ivx 5day change this the implied volatility change um of each products individual implied volatility this IV rank would be going higher as these numbers would be going Greener you'll notice here that here's where the earnings are I like to get rid of those earnings too by just clicking on earnings and now I have all the stocks without earnings in this list at the top of the list one of the stocks that I want to trade today and for different reasons not because it has high uh premium but because volatility has expanded ever so slightly but it does have a very low Ivy rank this is kind of the setup what I was looking at in meta uh when I traded meta relatively high price stock $413 out of the reach for most people for naked options it would take 7 to 8,000 for a naked option depending on where you're going there if you're going to do some sort of strangle I like to keep my buying power wrapped around $5,000 so it makes it a little bit more expensive plus it doesn't have a high rank for me to be selling premium in here I like to use some sort of calendar or diagonal spread that's what I did with meta that's a $550 stock I got the move wrong for a day or two took one day of getting the move right I was able to take a buck on that trade pretty uh quickly I'm looking to do that same type of trade in Microsoft here today low Ivy rank high price stock usually out of the reach of most people in a uh IRA account it might take 50 6 $60,000 to do a naked option you're going to have to do something with some defined risk so I like to go around 45 days you could certainly make an argument that December options with 31 days that's 14 days away from uh 45 days would be the options to go to you certainly can make an option for uh uh a discussion for January uh closest to 45 days also 14 days away from 45 days so let's use them both what I'm going to do here is I'm going to do a directional trade I'm looking at Microsoft that has a high correlation to the market you can see here volatil has been expanding a little bit uh as you noticed on the ivy rank 5day change that I showed you um uh Netflix has been on its butt kind of uh not cooperating with the overall Market although it does have a correlation of 73% now you can get correlations in the watch list if you want to or you can look on the right hand gutter of tasty trade that I don't have up here on the platform because it would take up too much room but you certainly could look there you look for C RR that's correlation uh correlation to the S&P 500 Microsoft has a 73 now you will notice over the try to take a a little bit of a blow up on this you will notice over the last four or five days it has moved with the &ps going lower but &ps are coming off of highs just four or five days ago NASDAQ which the Microsoft is also in been going down the last six or seven days days but it too is coming off of highs uh Microsoft on the other hand um is not coming off off anywhere near highs so I think the stocks a little bit beat up maybe they come for well I hate to call Microsoft a pig but maybe they come for the pigs for the end of the year so what am I doing in January I'm looking to buy an in the money option and you notice here there's plenty of volume in the options I have that here I'm going to change it right now um from uh in the money percentage to Delta to let's go to open interest just to show you a little bit more plenty of open interest even though the markets are 10 cents wide maybe a little bit uh tighter as you get a little lower fills are usually filled at Mid price Penny or two above or below I like to go to somewhere around the 60 or 70 Delta option to get my uh long premium fund from I'm going to go to the 60 Delta option here with 59 days I'm going to go to the 405 calls in January I'm going to look to buy one of those what am I going to do I'm going to look to sell something in December well if I'm looking to sell something in December and buy something in January I want the monthly implied volatility to be no greater than two full points so right now I have a 22% implied volatility in December and I have a 22.2% volatility in January that I'm buying not this 2% but a full 2% so for me not to make this trade December volatility would have to be 22 and January volatility would be be closer to 24 or 25 and then I would not look to make this trade I like to have volatility uh expand in January hopefully as time goes by and this has Theta Decay faster Theta Decay because there's less time for these options so in December I'm going to look to keep my mechanics the same I'm going to look to sell an option that's out of the money it wouldn't matter to me if you did the 420 the 417 or the 415 either um to create a small or as big a delta or diagonal as you want you'll notice that the 415 uh option if you sell here is going to be a little bit cheaper price than the one that I did you're going to see here that it has 11 and a half long Deltas it's got 15 long deltas and in the 20s it has uh 19 long Deltas that's where I went with this trade I got filled at $3 and3 when the stock was trading about 60 cents lower than where is right now why am I looking at this type of trade it has an embedded $15 wide diagonal long spread in it meaning this is a bullish strategy make no bones about it it has almost 20 long Deltas but yet I'm getting paid 200 I'm sorry $22.76 for that $1,300 in risk that I have on this trade that's my Max risk on this trade $1,300 to typically a lot smaller than the trade that I make with a lot bigger Delta that I make that's something Dynamic that you can get here um by trading calendar and trading different types of spreads using options you'll notice there's no pop on here no probability profit although you can go into the analyze Tab and mess around with the different volatilities of each month that you're long or short to see what will happen here the reason why there's no pop on this trade is you cannot anyway accurately predict what the volatility is going to be in December and what the volatility is going to be in January nor can you predict what the volatility between the two or more importantly between the two is going to be so really what you have to look at is here is the Delta on the position it's a 20 Delta long position in Microsoft that has not cooperated or has not participated with the overall Market at all so I'm looking at at this to catch a falling knife in Microsoft in a defined risk trade uh that has a relatively high probability of profit I'll put it above 60 uh on that that probability profit because that's because it has a a positive Theta Decay on the overall position but you know what go into the analyze tab play around in there doesn't cost you a dime to do it and see how it moves as volatility goes up and volatility goes down I will just quickly show you if you come down here to the follow page and you click on Bob the trader that's me you'll see here um my meta position in here somewhere I'll just do it this way for you because I couldn't see it me the last time we put on this position was on the seventh we were able to take it off on the 11th and I made almost a buck and you'll notice that the ivr actually expanded a little bit and the stock actually um you'll notice here that this was a put uh diagonal I was getting bearish in I sorry I think I said bullish in the beginning of mind the stock actually cooperated by $8 and I was able to make a buck on that trade let's hope that in Microsoft uh Microsoft cooperates by that same $ eight you'll see here I made this trade earlier today you can see those trades immediately when I make them on the tasty trade platform if you open Move transfer aat transfer bring to your account to tasty trade to take advantage of some of the great benefits they have here but you'll notice I wrote a long Delta diagonal and a highly correl low ivr stock expecting volatility to expand it does have earnings January 19th which is after the January expiration here so we won't benefit from that but maybe we'll get a little bit of a boost uh with two days before uh uh before earnings coming out being long that option all right
