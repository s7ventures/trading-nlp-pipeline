  "I have a strong opinion about the upcoming presidential election. It is uncertain how the market will react to the results. Is there a preferred choice of product or strategy to trade the election? It is recommended to trade something liquid like an S&P bet. Avoid sector bets.",
  "For trading election results, a highly diversified big index product would be my preferred choice. If I had a strong opinion on the election outcome, I would consider buying a wide debit spread or selling an out-of-the-money wide credit spread."
