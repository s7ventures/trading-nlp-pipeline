optimizing Wing width and buying power when aiming to gain exposure to a particular underlying and limit and the limiting factor is the buying power requirement of the trade so expensive underlyings are tradable with virtually any account size one of the things that I always tell people I love about options in general and one of the reasons they're so popular now and they're the fastest growing of all the financial products is because in the world of finance things are expensive now you know like stocks that used to be you know how tradable are is Tesla $350 for most people 100 Shar $35,000 how tradable is you know is is snow at 100 I'm just looking at my screen you know and every stock is crazy expensive now even you know even if you wanted to buy United Airlines it's $10,000 to buy 100 shares you know so one of the things that options have done is they've made financial markets in in light of the fact that the financial markets are significant ific L higher than they were a couple of years ago they've made financial markets accessible to anybody because option strategies allow you to trade a $200 stock a $500 stock thousand stock with a couple hundred dollars I'm not they put they put it in they put it in the reach of everyone yeah I'm not talking about buying out of the money calls I'm talking about you know you can do an at the money spread there's no $5 spread that's at the money that you can't do for $2.50 or 250 bucks right there's literally not one if you you buy an at the money spread in any underlying where you're one strike in the money one strike out of the money you're going to be 10 cents around $2.50 risk one to make one that's it so you can basically buy any trade any single stock you want in the world up or down you can buy an at the money put spread or an at the money call spread for $2.50 so you risk $2.50 to make $2.50 with a 50-50 shot that puts everything in play for everybody so this study aims to address the question how can we optimize buying power requirements for different types of neutral strategies with different Wing widths sounds a little heavy but it's not let's go next slide 2014 to 2024 10 years of research 45 days to expiration manag to 21 days we compared the average buying power for multiple underlying um a multiple underlying price upon entry for the following positions 10 16 20 and 30 Delta Les and iron Condors with 16 Delta short strikes and long wings of 510 and 13 Deltas so we're all over the place here let's go next slide we have every Delta covered so for shorts strangles the average buying power um the average buying power to underlying price Rao ranged from 19 to 23 meaning that these strategies would roughly require 11,000 to 13,500 in buying power if the Spy is trading for $600 regardless of of what Delta you chose okay so um just as an example because we're talking about how much money so the average buying power as a result of price you know it just we're just talking about the Delta vers the price just so you can put some context runs so how much does it cost to do one strangle whether it's 10 Deltas 16 Deltas 20 Deltas or 30 Deltas it's between 11,000 and 13,000 okay just because the price is so expensive of those underlyings let's go next slide so the varing Deltas of these strategies had a fairly small impact on the buying power requirements of the trade meaning the strangles with expensive underlyings are generally unsuitable for smaller accounts because even if you go further out of the money you still have to put up the same amount of money within reason so however in terms of risk with a strangle when you widen the wings it reduces your buffer against extreme losses so a higher ratio indicates a more secure risk profile you know that that's it all it's saying is if you go wider you just got much wider Break Even losses okay so that's your buying power divided by your worst loss but if you go to the next slide where we're going to look at iron condors and remember this is 10 years of data from 2014 to 2024 these are selling a 16 Delta short and buying the 510 and 13 Delta wings so comparatively iron Condors with the same underlying have sign ific lower buying power requirements um one time to 22 times less depending on the long wings so an iron Condor would require between $600 and 4700 in buying power if the Spy was trading at the same price 600 bucks to make it more appropriate for expensive underlyings and smaller accounts so you can see here I mean forget about the 136 because that's really narrow but you can see with the other ones you know it's again it's a fraction of what it would cost for a um for a wide strangle or you know a a it's a fraction of what it across for a 16 delt triangle um anyway so you can kind of see the average buying power as a percent uh divided by underlying price is eight times three times than one time depending on how wide we make the wing so it's between 600 and $4,700 hopefully that makes sense yeah for sure yeah and the the strangle is 22 times so just to put things into context um let's go to the next slide so the choice of long Delta for an iron Condor also has a marger much larger impact on buying power of the trade compared to the choice of short Delta for the strangle what we learned from the first slide was if you choose a different Delta for the strangle it can vary a little bit but not much more than like 10% % but if you choose a different strike for the iron Condor it could vary as much as 500% you know or actually higher than that even 600% so this makes it a fairly versatile strategy the iron Condor offering a high pop high probabil high pop high buying power profiles for larger accounts in a lower pop lower browing profiles lower buying power reduction profiles for smaller accounts the widening of the Wings and iron condr becomes the strike price distances offering a larger profit range but reducing the premium collected and thereby decreasing the buffer significantly there's nothing to take away from this other than risk is very symmetrical when it comes to options and sometimes the amount of money you have will dictate your price selection sometimes the amount of risk you want to take will dictate your price selection but sure especially for for larger accounts you have a lot more optionality or flexibility for smaller accounts sometimes you just have to do what you are capable of doing based on the amount of money that you have so sometimes that's the restrictive part of smaller accounts you're not disadvantaged in any way but you just have limitations as to what you can do let's go to last slide last one yep so expensive underlyings are tradable with with virtually any account size but the appropriate strategy is going to depend on the total buying power of a portfolio you don't want to get much bigger then you know if it's Define risk I'm going to say 1 to 3% unless it's a small account then you know 5 to 7% if it's undefined risk 3 to 5% a larger account and um you know five to seven five to 10% a smaller account just be careful keep those numbers as low as you can think as as you can try te as low as you can strangles with expensive underlyings are generally unsuitable for smaller accounts regardless of Delta as we showed you don't save a lot by widening the strikes and comparatively the buying power requirements for iron Condors are very sensitive to wing withd and they offer a high pop high buying power requirement for larger accounts and a lower pop lower buying power requirements for smaller accounts
