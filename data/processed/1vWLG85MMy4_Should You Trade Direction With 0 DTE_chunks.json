  "This is a zero DTE piece our research team put together. Do you think you get paid by being directional based on an overnight move in the SPX? If the market was up overnight, do you buy? If it goes down overnight, do you sell?",
  "When the market opens the next morning, consider trading based on the overnight market movements. Decide whether to sell a strangle, a naked put, or other options based on your analysis. The study period for zero DTS is likely short, possibly around 18 months.",
  "In the past 18 months, we have seen all-time highs in the market. Selling puts after a down day has been profitable. This study focuses on overnight markets and whether to sell puts or calls. We will provide all the necessary information for making informed decisions.",
  "I believe selling puts may be more beneficial than calls, but the impact may not be as significant as expected. The market has performed well over the past 18 months, with record highs being reached recently.",
  "At this point, it may be challenging to find success in put selling strategies. Our core mechanics focus on delta neutral strategies, although we also incorporate some directional strategies. Zero DT options present a unique opportunity for trading.",
  "Zero DT options are different from longer-dated options, prompting a re-evaluation of our trading practices. Choosing to be long Delta, short Delta, or neutral Delta depends on personal risk preference and market assumptions. Overnight moves can serve as signposts for zero DT trades. Conducting 18 months of research is crucial for making informed decisions.",
  "We conducted 18 months of research using tick data every 10 minutes to sell zero DTE options at market opening. We used 35, 25, and 15 Deltas for put and call options separately. All trades were closed at 25% of Max profit for quick profits.",
  "Contra contrasted the performance based on the size and direction of the overnight moves. Did X rise or fall by more than half a percent overnight? Did S change in absolute value by more than half a percent? Short 16 Delta puts.",
  "This trading strategy has a high win percentage of 97% overall, with a potential increase to 98% if the market rises and 96% if it falls. It has been successful for 18 straight months.",
  "If you sold 16 Delta puts on the opening every day since we had zero DT options, you would have made money regardless of market movement. Let's now look at the performance of selling 15 Delta calls in a bull market.",
  "The win percentage in the bull market is 92%, with a 100% win percentage at the S Fe F. Despite a small overnight drop, the overall win percentage is higher than expected. However, there was a loss of $80 per trade when selling puts.",
  "You lost $80 per trade selling calls, but made money selling puts. Selling calls only worked with a big down move in the market. Short puts still performed well, with an average daily P&L of $118.",
  "Overall, short puts with a 15 or 25 Delta performed well, with an average daily profit of $118. However, selling calls resulted in losses unless the S&P was significantly down overnight. Selling calls only made sense in high volatility situations.",
  "When volatility is high, you can trade both sides. Even if the market reverses, there is still potential for profit. Despite the S&P being down more than half a percent overnight, win percentages were high but overall, selling zero DTE calls resulted in losses.",
  "Zero DTE on the call side with 15 or 25 Delta did not work well, but selling puts consistently yielded positive results. Focus on the $35 strike, specifically the 35 Delta puts, which have shown a high win rate and significant profits over the past 18 months.",
  "In the last 18 months, the market has been up over 60% of the time. Calls with a 35 Delta have mostly been losers, except when the market was down significantly. Selling puts on the opening has been a successful strategy for getting long during this period.",
  "In the past 18 months, short out-of-the-money zero DT puts have been a winning trade when managed aggressively at 25% of max profit. The performance was generally strong, except when the S&P was significantly down.",
  "The S&P opened down 100 points but closed up, allowing for a 25% profit. Short puts were successful with large overnight gains, while short calls were successful after large overnight losses. The efficient market hypothesis suggests not putting too much emphasis on timing.",
  "While some believe past price moves should not heavily influence trading decisions, analyzing overnight moves in Z trades can be a useful starting point. The numbers show significant potential for profit."
