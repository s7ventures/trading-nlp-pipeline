  "let's do it this is more than off this is a zero DT piece that our research team put together that is I really like it anyway it's they called it to long or not to long I don't even know what that means but based on overnight moves in the SPX the es whatever you want to say what about directionality for zero DTE do you think you get paid by being directional based on an overnight move so let's say the market was up overnight last night do you buy them the Mark goes down overnight do you sell",
  "buy them the Mark goes down overnight do you sell them I mean what do you do based on what happens in the overnight markets when the Market opens the next morning and you're sitting there going all right how do I want to trade these zero DTS I don't want to sell a strangle should I just sell a naked put you know puts or Schmutz puts or Schmutz yeah I mean I don't know how long this study is going to be with with zero in one day I'm gonna imagine it's relatively short um 18 months 18 months yeah",
  "it's relatively short um 18 months 18 months yeah and in that time frame we've gone to all-time highs yes so I I got to say if we had a down day and you sold puts for the next day you had to have done well I think it's good I think you get paid sure this is an 18-month study looking at overnight markets and determining whether you should sell puts or calls or just taking a directional shot we're going to give you all the no I was gonna say like I don't think the I'm gonna say the numb is gonna",
  "I don't think the I'm gonna say the numb is gonna be better for just selling puts versus puts versus calls but I don't think it's G to be I don't think it's going to be as big as you think that would be my guess the there is no question over the last 18 months since we've had zero de options that the market has done really well in fact for the last two years the Market's been up huge and um we're we're basically you know a day off record highs right um so it would be really hard at this point",
  "right um so it would be really hard at this point you know to think that that anything you did in the put selling with with respect to put selling would be successful sure let's take a look so it tastes your our core mechanics rely primarily on delta neutral strategies and and and to be fair you know we're pretty directional so it's not that's not totally true but when we when we when we talk about we do research it it's mostly delt Neal but the zero DT options are different different enough",
  "zero DT options are different different enough from longer dated options that it's worth re-evaluating are our long-standing practices in an efficient market deciding to be long Delta short Delta or neutral Delta is a personal risk preference and Market assumptions but what happens if we pick a side for a de zero DT trades and have overnight moves been helpful as signposts have they been helpful in US picking Direction so we did in this case like we always do now we use 18 months of research",
  "we always do now we use 18 months of research and we used all the the basically the tick data every 10 minutes just so we can control the amount of data we considered selling zero DTE options not the day before but at the market opening using Deltas now 35 Deltas 25 deltas and 15 Deltas options put sand call not together but puts in calls all the trades were closed to 25% of Max profit so this is not holding all day this is just quickly taking profits if you can we Contra contrasted the",
  "profits if you can we Contra contrasted the Performance Based on the size and direction of the overnight moves did the X rise or fall overnight was that by more than a half a percent and did the S change in absolute value by more than half a percent and we did everything at mid-price so you can add a little or subtract a little which however you want to look at it so short 16 Delta puts now this is the one that if you were ever going to have one that's going to be probably the most I'm not",
  "one that's going to be probably the most I'm not saying the best bang for your buck but I'm saying you're gonna have the highest win percentage this is going to be it because Tony and I both said we've been up for 18 straight months this has been kind of the layup I mean sure I didn't I don't do this but this has been a layup hindsight right I mean in hindsight the win percentage overall 97% which is insane if the xpx rose overnight 98% if the if it fell this is selling puts 96% % if the SPX Ro",
  "it fell this is selling puts 96% % if the SPX Ro it didn't matter what happened half a point down up whatever it is you made money if you just sold 16 Delta puts on the opening in the zero DTS every single day since we since we had zero DT options except for today you'd be doing quite well right and the day is not over but sure you'd be doing quite quite well let's go next slide so now we're going to look at the 15 Delta calls would you have done as well considering it's been on bull market the",
  "as well considering it's been on bull market the win percentages are really high 92% overall the win percentage is actually higher than I thought here and and the interesting thing here is 100% win percentage at the S Fe F fell by more than a half a percent overnight and a half a percent is nothing I mean let's put it where it is 25 20 2528 SPO handles yeah exactly yeah but but here's the crazy thing Tony overall you lost money yeah that is crazy overall you lost $80 a trade if you sold puts",
  "overall you lost $80 a trade if you sold puts you made a lot of money if you sold calls you lost money even though at a 92% win rate and more than more than I had suspected prior to the to seeing the stud yeah pretty much selling calls only worked if the snps had a had a pretty big down move overnight as you go up step up a class in Delta here to the 25 Deltas your short puts still worked really well of course you know regardless of the market overall 95% your average daily p&l $118 overall",
  "overall 95% your average daily p&l $118 overall short puts worked really well the the 15 Delta or the 25 Delta if you go to the next slide which is the calls it's a very different story you lost money pretty much no matter what you did unless the S&P was down big overnight the only time to sell calls was when the S&P was down big overnight because it didn't it must not have reversed against you that many times or the volatility got you know so high that even if it did reverse it didn't reach",
  "high that even if it did reverse it didn't reach that number again just another way of saying you know when volatility is high you you you can almost do you know you can do both sides and that's only when the S&P by the way was down more than a half a percent overnight as measured by we put SPX here but it's really the the es Futures is how they do that judge that the win percentages were still really high but you overall lost money so selling zero DTE overall on the call side whether it's 15",
  "zero DTE overall on the call side whether it's 15 Delta or 25 Delta did not work unless there was a big down move overnight selling puts Works no matter what let's go to the $35 much you said it from the very beginning on the 35 Delta I mean the win rate's still ridiculous and you can see here you even made more money right you killed it with 35 Delta puts I mean those are you know the the bigger the put the more money you made that's because over the last 18 months instead of being up 53% of",
  "the last 18 months instead of being up 53% of the time the Market's been up closer to you know over 60% of the time that's why these numbers are huge if you go to the calls I'm sure it's not going to be as pretty and go to the next slide Beth 35 Delta calls and every number is pretty much a loser unless we were down big yep y so the the takeaway from this is with the Zero DS for the last 18 months if you wanted to get long you did really well selling puts on the opening didn't matter what what",
  "puts on the opening didn't matter what what Delta if you wanted to get Short Selling calls you did really poorly period That's the fact Jack that's the fact unless the S&P was down big that's only thing let's go to the next slide Beth so takeaways over the past 18 months short out of the money zero DT puts have generally been a winning trade provided they were managed aggressively remember these are all managed at 25% of Max profit so nothing went to the end of the day so you had a day like we",
  "to the end of the day so you had a day like we had one day where we opened down like 100 points the S&P we closed up but you had a chance to manage that at 25% you were out 25% of the profit yes correct right a large overnight gain in the was the only negatively correlated factor for short putut success short calls on the other hand were generally successful only after large overnight losses or large overnight drops I'm sorry the efficient market hypothesis says that we shouldn't put too much",
  "hypothesis says that we shouldn't put too much faith in looking at past price moves for making our trading decisions but if you decide to be directional with your Z trades considering overnight s moves or overnight es moves is a reasonable place to start the numbers are pretty remarkable as Spanky would say of the hour gang remarkable"
