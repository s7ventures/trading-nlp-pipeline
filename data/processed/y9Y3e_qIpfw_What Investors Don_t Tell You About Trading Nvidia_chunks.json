  "measuring the odds of L this is our Market measure sponsored by seub measuring the odds of large daily moves in high volatility stocks huh measuring the odds of large daily moves in high volatility stocks let's go to the sponsored by the CV let's go to the first slide in this segment we delve into the Dynamics of Major Market shifts in an effort to uncover patterns in their occurrence specifically we aim to answer two critical questions all right Pat here are your questions ready How likely are",
  "Pat here are your questions ready How likely are significant Market moves um to happen within a defined time frame and how could we quantify the major ETFs and and liquid single Stocks by analyzing past events of similar magnitude we can assess the probability of such shifts taking place again I think they happen often not too often Major Market moves obviously more so in stocks than ETFs obviously individual stocks sure individual stocks yeah it's harder to move 500 stocks or outside than it",
  "it's harder to move 500 stocks or outside than it is for one stock sure How likely are they going to happen because you know why you know why we're answering this qu you know why we're po because we don't want it to happen we play the don't line exactly exactly the reason we asked this question is because this is not good for business um so let's go next slide so we used two ETFs to spy of the qes and we used used two stocks Tesla and Nvidia the reason we chose Tesla Nvidia is because those are",
  "reason we chose Tesla Nvidia is because those are the two most liquid option um of optionable stocks those are the two most liquid of the ETFs spy and the q's are the two most liquid of optionable ETFs we did 2015 to present 10 years we calculated the probabilities of having a certain number of 1% 3% 5% 7% and 10% daily moves in a 5day trading window okay you got that y 1357 and 10 in five days okay next slide please I can't guess I mean no no no on the foremost actively the foremost the",
  "no no on the foremost actively the foremost the foremost active option trading Vehicles okay so the first one we start with spy the likelihood of experiencing from four to 5 days a 7 or 10% movement within a single week has been zero for the last 10 years in the Spy however the probability of encountering at least one movement of 1% or more in a week is relatively High Additionally the Spy has an average daily movement of 1.11% so so I mean if you're going to have it's going to happen almost",
  "you're going to have it's going to happen almost every day if you're going to say that right well let's take a look we have the numbers right in front of you right there mhm and a 1% move and this is just um happening you can see the numbers happening once 25% twice 8% three you know just across the board that's so what are you worried about it's really what it's saying here what are you worried about ex exactly I mean you you but don't jump right to the punch line have a little fun with this",
  "to the punch line have a little fun with this so the chance of having a 10% move I mean you can see it's or a 7% move um we're in the zero handle and um well 135 we put all the numbers in front of you the chances of big moves are relatively small mhm but when they happen they're very very painful yep relatively small very very painful um let's go next slide similar to the Spy the qes have also shown a 0% likelihood of experiencing a 57 or 10% move in a single week looking at the past 10 years",
  "in a single week looking at the past 10 years the q's have an average daily movement of 1.37 compared to 1.11 for spy and you can see the numbers across the board here they look very similar MH hard to hard would be difficult to differentiate between the q's and the spies um but the numbers look kind of pretty basic pretty much across the board the same my take away from this would be the same thing if you know like understand a 10 nobody looks for a 10% move of course I mean nobody plays for",
  "for a 10% move of course I mean nobody plays for it in the snps you know a a 10% move in the snps would be 6,000 points MH that's a lot it's a lot yeah yeah so you're not going to see that a 1% move 60 points we'd be we'd be closed oh we'd be closed we'd be shut down Mark circuit breakers yep let's go to next slide over a longer time frame like 10 years ETFs tend to remain stable with the daily moves typically staying between 1 and 2% in contrast individual stocks like Tesla and Nvidia exhibit",
  "individual stocks like Tesla and Nvidia exhibit higher volatility making significant price swings more frequent so now we'll take a look let's go next slide Beth so as a highly liquid and volatile individual stock Tesla we expect to get more daily movement with the average daily move around 4% so the Spy 1.1 The Q's 1.37 and Tesla 4% that's why it's so actively traded because people love trading something that moves around that's why they all have higher implied volatility too monthly implied",
  "higher implied volatility too monthly implied volatility than you you're going to see in a individual stock then you're going to see in an ETF the probability of experiencing five 7% and 10% movements with a single week still been zero so far but at least one movement of 1% or more per week is relatively High yeah of course um and when you start to look at the numbers here um uh it's they're very different when you start talking about stocks that move 4% a day but the prices also reflect that",
  "move 4% a day but the prices also reflect that so when you look at the amount of money that you make or have the potential to make that's why Tony said this morning his best performing stock that's yours Tesla yeah because you can make more money in there or Nvidia or whatever else it is let's go to take a look at the next slide which should be very similar in Nvidia Nvidia has also shown a 0% likelihood of experiencing a a five 7% or 10% movement within a single week and over the past 10 years",
  "within a single week and over the past 10 years it's experienced an average daily movement of 3.5% just under what Tesla has and we played out all the numbers for you here so you can see it's very interesting yes it is just you know that that you know you get paid three over three times trading inidia over what over what you wouldn't Des spise because that's how much more um risk you're taking you get paid four times in Tesla over the despise because that's how much more risk you're taking um",
  "that's how much more risk you're taking um let's go to the next slide so there is very little probability of having a bunch of large moves back to back according to our study over the past 10 years individual stocks have exhibited more than three times the frequency of large daily movements compared to spy I'm sorry compared to ETFs and since early 2025 we've seen more large Market movements compared to 24 offering profit opportunities to increase liquidity but also posing risks like loss",
  "liquidity but also posing risks like loss distress margin cause slippage and strong and requiring strong risk management this is all super interesting"
