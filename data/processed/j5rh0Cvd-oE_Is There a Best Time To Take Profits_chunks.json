  "When do you take profits on a butterfly trade? The easy answer is to close it when it reaches your desired profit level. If the trade isn't working, there's not much you can do except accept the loss and move on. Taking profits is subjective, but some traders aim to make two to four times their initial investment before closing the trade.",
