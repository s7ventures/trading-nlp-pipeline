Market measures part three zero DT timing 24 marked our first full year of gathering the zero DT data tasty Market measures are chance to share the results with you in depth as we head into 2025 we're going to review some of our best zert research of 24 and we're going to explore the importance of timing when it comes to zero DT trades so our study using one year of data and zero DT SPX options collected every 10 minutes for 15 years worth of data um in the 45 day options so in the zero it's whatever it is 20 months and in the other data we're going to show you is 15 years We examined selling strangles with 20 Delta legs both at the zero DT Market open and 45 days expiration we contracted the hourly performance as a percent of the initial credit for the Zer DTS and the weekly performance of the 45 dat expiration trades next slide please lot of stuff here this is old stuff that we're just showing you this is weeks verse hours okay the first one 4 5 days to expiration strangles first two weeks average p&l change 11% second two weeks 24% thirdd week tough one um minus two and then the final week plus 16 standard deviation of change you could see the the first week the key is the last line the standard deviation of change 6% is very manageable 12% very manageable 28 and 53 that's where it gets tough it's not so much it's not worth the return at that point let's go to the next slide and this one we're going to show you zero DTS so on the Zero DTS strangles it's the same thing look at the last line standard deviation of panl change what's interesting here is that the first two hours 19% manageable second two hours 34% the third two hours 56% and then the final hour 153 yeah you're just swinging you're just swinging it 153 now I'm not saying minus five in your average p on first two hours nothing great okay but um the second 2 hours you know that's pretty damn good so in that first 2-hour period there's a chance to make some money it it's not worth the risk holding to the end of the day at 19 and 34% very manageable 56 to 153 not so much both the Zer GT and the 45 de St exporation trades had more stable prices early in their LIF spans as measured by the lower standard deviation of returns that's what I showed you for both managing winners to capture early success were the more beneficial Mechanics for early in the zero DTS it just means the first few hours instead of the first few weeks for the 45 days for handling losers the zero DTS gave more opportunities for Traders to succeed using their own style more risk Toler and Traders could choose to stay in losers and hope for Recovery before the close did this late in the day success mean it was a good idea to trade zero DTS even if you missed the Market opening next slide let's have some fun this is our kind of fun so using 20 months worth of data in the SPX Zer DTS now people that have a smaller account that want to trade without pattern day trading rules using the es options same exact thing it's not cash settled but it's the same underlying product es spy um SPX they're all the same Mees XSP they're all the same but some have pattern day trading rules some Don't We examined selling Zer DT strangle using the 20 and 30 Delta strikes at Market open 10: a.m. noon and 1:30 all the all the times are Chicago Times CT all the trades were managed if they reached 25% losers that didn't reach 25% were allowed to expire all trades were assumed at Mid price let's go to next slide okay so you can take a little off if you want here's your 20 Delta strangles that were um these were just the on the Zero days plac at Market open you made you 89% win rate placed at 10: a.m. 88 so so it didn't matter what time you placed for the win rate what it mattered for was how much money you made and the average pnl is significantly higher if you put your trades in um early in the day period that's it first two hours 30 Deltas triangles exact same thing everything happens in the first everything happens p&l wise in the first two hours or the majority of it so since we started trading the Zer TTS in 23 they have been consistently profitable for short premium traders who took profits early choosing strikes by Delta automatically adjust trades for the current volatility levels in the time remaining in the contract giving consistent success probabilities and helping retail Traders expand into new Arenas with confidence while the zero TT trades had more success stories for those who held on through expiration than the 4 5day trades placing new trades late in the day was detrimental just like placing new trades late in a cycle can also be a little bit detrimental
