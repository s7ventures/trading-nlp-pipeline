welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today what's the date it's October 22nd 2024 and I'm right here in the Batcave right here in downtown Chicago but first as I always do let's take a quick look at what's going on the market even the S&P is down 15 handles meaning 15 points $15.75 they're about mid-range for the day as you can see here from the high low basically unchanged down around a quar perc Nasdaq doing the same uh Russell also doing the same maybe a little weaker or the weakest of the group that's kind of been the way things have been going the last couple of days as you can see here the Russell selling off a little bit as the rest of the market have been catching a little bit of a bid over the last couple of days the Dow down 80 volatility up 33 cents that's up almost 2% on a relatively small move to the downside volatility staying bid a little bit here going into the middle of the week bonds traded uh down to 11802 to uh even with interest rates being cut bonds keep going down remember bonds usually have an inverse relationship rates go uh lower bonds go higher but not this case right now I am looking at the 30-year but you could see here the 10year fzn doing exactly the same thing but I've got a little bit of a different uh conversation or talk to have today um I've got a lot of emails about you know cost of capital and do you ever look at buying power um to take a look at at that so I'm going to do two things here well first let's go to the uh High option volume list and I'll put in the two stocks that I want to look at just to save a little bit of time Goldman Sachs is one I'm going to go by symbols here and just put it in alphabetical order for you here uh Goldman Sachs let's take a look at it just on on paper here uh from the high option volume List $519 stock relatively high price stock uh $500 stock is going to use a lot of buying power so that's going to be a knock against it it's up around $1.74 today it's had a relatively uh average size move about $5 today the ivx 5day change very important number for me I like to see that number green it's slightly red over the last 5 days this is volatility over the last 5 days The Ivy rank of 37 is good and no earnings looming now I'm going to compare the same strategy in this $500 stock with JP Morgan JP Morgan I have right down here at the bottom of the screen uh half the amount of uh buying power would be needed uh because a $224 stock versus a $500 stock up today also just like Goldman Sachs relatively average size move around $2 it's down the same amount of ivx 5day change just under half a percentage point and its IV rank is actually slightly higher at 38 versus gold sacks which we had up here is 37 and change but I think we can all say that for friends and we're all friends here the ivy rank is exactly the same the ivx 5day change is exactly the same the relative move for the day is about the same and the price is two times as much just rounding here JP Morgan versus Goldman Sachs they're both in the same type of Industry let's look at the buying power relationship between two similar type trades I'll stay in JP Morgan I'm going to go to December earnings aren't until January you'll notice here that I have the volume volume's good not great uh although the markets are quite tight this is just the uh volume for the day let's look at the open interest here uh open interest thousands of contracts on either side so this checks all the box as a tight liquid Market meaning the bid ask between the strikes relatively tight and liquid plenty of of volume volum here to Warrant a trade not the volume that you need volume but you want to be a you don't want to be the only one playing in the sandbox so what am I going to look at JP Morgan let's just look at around a 20ish Delta strangle on both sides I'm going to go to the 210 on the puts I'm going to go to the 240s on the calls basically delta neutral 55 uh Deltas here a pop of 65% the Theta decay $970 without volatility moving one way or the other uh your max profit obviously what you're selling it for $494 uh your max loss they say is unlimited I Define it by the amount of buying power that you have here so you're getting paid around or your max profit can be around $495 depending on where you get filled uh on the $3,000 or $3,100 in buying power $ 65% pop on the overall trade I like to have trades that are over 65% 5 or more around that uh standard deviation or that dotted line that we're looking at here uh on the uh tasty trade platform okay that's JP Morgan put those numbers in your head or write them down so you have them here uh going to be a little test after this not really but you know there's going to be a little bit of a test let's look at Goldman Sachs now Goldman Sachs a much higher price stock we're going to go to December it has earnings to in January uh look at the open interest not quite as strong uh open interest as we had in JP Morgan so maybe a tad uh the needle moving to maybe a JP Morgan trade right here let's go to the 20ish Delta I'll go to the 480 puts that's a 20ish Delta uh plenty of volume in in that line decent markets for a $500 uh stock and I'll go to the 560 calls which is around a 20ish Delta here and let's take a look at the numbers on top 67 pop versus a 65% pop a Theta Decay 25 uh much higher than what you had in JP Morgan but obviously because a higher price stock um Delta basically delta neutral just like the JP Morgan $1,255 That's the mid price that's what you would be uh selling this for and the buying power effect is $6,500 versus $3,100 so the buying power effect is twice as great as what we had in JP Morgan but the credit we received is more than twice as much that we had in uh JP Morgan remember JP Morgan the it was closer to 4 $494 $490 here you've got $1250 $1,255 um remember it was twice as much it be $10 so on a relative basis all things being the same your probably profit being the same uh your buying power being twice as much or a little bit more than twice as much but yet you get compensated by the extra um credit that you received that makes Goldman Sachs my choice or my trade for today so I'm going to look to sell the strangle uh you'll be able to see it on a follow page in just a moment I'm going to sell the 480 560 I'm going to try to collect around $12.55 which would be the mid price on this trade you will see it on the follow page um if you have the tasty trade platform and that's when I tell you right now please open Move transfer bring your account
