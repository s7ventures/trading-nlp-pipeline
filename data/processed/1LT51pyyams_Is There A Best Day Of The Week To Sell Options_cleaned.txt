is there any advantage in selling options on a Friday versus a Monday you know the weekend's coming that doesn't mean that the options have to lose their weekend value over the next two days because there's no Advantage I wish there was I wish there was some tell here I would let you all know but there is none the market has the its own little genius and it's got its own brain and it kind of just does whatever it wants to do it has a really good feel for risk as a whole so no there's no Advantage at all yeah zero
