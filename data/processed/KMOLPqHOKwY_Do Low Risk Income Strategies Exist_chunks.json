  "can you please give me some ideas for lowrisk income generating strategies I don't know I don't have one there is no such thing as income generating first of all for me it's not that easy to find a stock that's high dividend paying low risk that you could write calls against anything that has an annualized return of between 8 and 14% would be considered a lowrisk income generating strategy a 12 14 or 16 Delta put in the spies that would probably generate about 1% a month that would be considered",
