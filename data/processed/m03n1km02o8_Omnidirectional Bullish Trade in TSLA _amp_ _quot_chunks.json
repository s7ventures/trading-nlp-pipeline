  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the bat batist and I have a trade idea for you today February 18th 2025 but first as we always do let's take a look at what the Market's doing even snps up $9 uh pretty tight range today of around 30 handles top to bottom NASDAQ uh up 13 pretty much unchanged like theps Russell up 10 they're the leader of the clubhouse and the Dow obviously the weakest being down $70 volatility in by 16 volatility really hasn't gone anywhere today or as you could see here",
  "gone anywhere today or as you could see here over the last week as we've been kind of trending higher in the market overall uh today all right like I always do I like to go to my high option uh volume list I click on those little lines there I have high option volume I like to move away from earnings so I click it so that earnings are um are are not a factor here uh they're all taken away so all these stocks would be the ones I'm looking at but before I get to the trade of the day I want to",
  "before I get to the trade of the day I want to show you something that I did which is kind of a flyer something I don't normally do uh but I did do an smci today um you'll notice smci up $5 in change it was up around $6 in change just a moment ago but it has humongous call skew let's take a look at smci you can see here the stock has gone from 20 and change to 50 and change its old highs which are you know over the last year or so has been around 120 that's going to come into play so keep that",
  "120 that's going to come into play so keep that in mind as I speak to you uh now about this trade that I put on as a flyer this is not mechanical this is not what I normally want everybody to do but every once in a while you know you see opportunity and you try to make it uh you try to make it stick so I went to march with 31 days knowing that I'm going to hold this probably all the way through expiration and I do want the stock to go higher this is not the type of trade where I normally do",
  "this is not the type of trade where I normally do where I want the stock to do the opposite on this ratio spread that I'm going to do here when I took a look at some of these options the way they've been trading look at how far out you can go all the way back up to the highs of where the stock was and there's still plenty of option premium in here now they're 5060 Cent that doesn't get me crazy to sell a naked option and use all that buying power for the 50 60 cents my name is not Tom snof so",
  "for the 50 60 cents my name is not Tom snof so I'm going to have to do something where I can make a little bit of money in here if my directional assumption is correct so I went out to around the 10 Delta option and I bought the 97 call one time and I went all the way out to the 115 calls that's $18 wide and sold two of them uh uh let's uh click this one more time here uh make this sorry make this one too there we go um I was able to do this right where it is right now for a s Cent credit it's",
  "where it is right now for a s Cent credit it's a 89 cent credit the credit you receive is really um inconsequential at this point what you will rarely see in a $50 stock the last time this happened was in GMC what you'll really rarely see in a very Rel relatively low price stock is going out two and three times in price and still being able to get a small credit I'm $18 wide here $18 wide which means that um $1,800 is my Max profit here $1,800 plus the credit I received my break even on this is",
  "the credit I received my break even on this is all the way above its old high for this year my break even is all the way out at 132 or $33 so what I'm really looking to do on this trade usually when I'm doing a 1 by two ratio spread which I'm going to do in Tesla in just a moment I'm looking to collect the credit I'm receiving what I'm doing here is saying okay you know what I don't know what's going on in smci you want to take it to the upside I'm going to put a flyer on here I'm going to use",
  "I'm going to put a flyer on here I'm going to use $1,600 in buying power I'm going to have a 99% pop which you know what with call skew you got to take that into consideration here that that that that that number is not quite realistic I mean 99% is just too high I get paid a small amount of theta dek I'm not looking at that and this is a small amount of negative Delta but remember if the stock closes or goes around 115 we're going to have this huge call spread that we're going to be long the",
  "huge call spread that we're going to be long the 9715 we're long that one time and we have an extra 115 call that we're short but with the extra 1,800 bucks that we have here it brings our break even as I just told to you above the old high from a year ago this is a complete flyer meaning you have to have $1,600 lying on the sidelines that you know you will never use again in the next 31 days because you're going to probably keep this on for most of the expiration you want the stock to slowly",
  "of the expiration you want the stock to slowly go higher uh to your 97 98 99 number where you make yourself two three four 500 bucks on your $1,600 in buying power that's my flyer trade you certainly could go a lot closer and collect a lot more um credit have a lower probability of profit let's just go to the 80s just for argument sakes I'll buy one of the 80s and I'll go uh I don't know uh $20 wide go up to the 110 if we can you won't be able to so we have to go $100 does do that 1 by two and",
  "so we have to go $100 does do that 1 by two and you'll notice that it's a small debit you'll have to move it down a little bit there there's your now you're still get a small debit it's just these out of the- money calls like here here I'm doing one $895 $15 wide it's going to have basically the same pop basically the same amount of of buying power using your break even is obviously going to be a little bit lower down at 110 I like my far out really wide taking a flyer hey come bite me uh smci",
  "wide taking a flyer hey come bite me uh smci come trade up to 100 105 110 120 even and I'll still be able to make money that's my flyer trade for you in smci using March options with 31 days doing everything that is not mechanical taking a flyer don't do this type of trade unless you have $1,600 in buying power that you never want to use and you assume that upside risk my next trade is going to go back into Tesla Tesla was one of the last trades I did um on this podcast before I took a quick",
  "I did um on this podcast before I took a quick little uh break there uh last week uh Tesla implied volatility Ivy rank still relatively high at 36 it has come down a little bit from when we put on that bullish trade when the stock made its lows at around 330 that was a nice catch on price and it was a nice catch um on the movement back up I'm going to do the same trade but I'm going to stay a little bit more mechanical here I'm going to go out to April with the stock down today down a174 you're",
  "April with the stock down today down a174 you're going to be able to do it a little bit better price than I just did it a moment ago I'm gonna go uh on in Tesla I'm going to be an omnidirectional slightly bullish I don't want to be tested on my short strike unlike the smci trade I just did I'm going to buy one of the 280 puts I'm going to sell two of the 270 puts and again you're not you know here here I'm able to go uh $10 wide I did mine at $233 it's already 245 I did mind when the stock was",
  "it's already 245 I did mind when the stock was down around 60 cents the stock has gone down by about a dollar and you see this has moved about 10 cents that makes sense because the delta in here is long six every dollar move this should move around six bucks or so that's if volatility stays the same hey speaking of volatility let's see what that volatility is doing in Tesla right now I'm going to go uh right here you'll see volatility is down about 2% it was down about a half a % when I put the",
  "2% it was down about a half a % when I put the trade on the ivy rank is still high at 36% you remember when we did this trade uh about a week or so ago um implied volatility was expanding so even over the last 5 days volatility is staying bid even though it is down 2% this is really a directional trade on a stock that has not um participated in the movement that we've been seeing as of late in the market plus Tom wrote a uh Cherry Bomb today that was not favorable to Elon Musk and Tesla so",
  "that was not favorable to Elon Musk and Tesla so we'll take the contrarian role and put on an omnidirectional slightly bullish trade in Tesla buying one of the 80 puts selling two of the 270 puts this is a capital intensive trade using almost $6,000 5,800 bucks it does have a 90% pop very similar to the smci uh trade what am I looking to do here I'm looking for the stock to go higher and probably making my dollar hopefully the stock goes higher tomorrow and goes higher in a big way or goes",
  "tomorrow and goes higher in a big way or goes higher today in a big way unlike the smci trade where I want the stock to slowly go higher the stock goes higher faster that will make my trade a little bit less advantageous and harder for us to make money all I want the stock to do is stay above my break even on here which is down around $260 actually $245 below $260 that's why I have that high probability profit of 90% omnidirectional slightly bullish trade again if you're watching this podcast",
  "trade again if you're watching this podcast at the end of the day or later on you can always go to the follow page during the day I post these trades in real time when I make them all you have to do is click on Bob the trader you'll see my two trades there's my smci trade trade it small I didn't mention that on this podcast this is one if you make it you must trade at small I did half my normal size this is a flyer taking a shot smci trading like it's a takeover crazy upside call skew looking",
  "it's a takeover crazy upside call skew looking to hit uh a tweener here I want it could to go right there at 115 and stop uh come on plus 100 on the stock price but go slowly and in Tesla we got another trade it's a typical 1 by two omnidirectional slightly bullish trade more of what you're used to seeing on this podcast all right everybody I hope you like my little um my little flyer that I'm taking there in smci maybe you find it advantageous for you too but I know something you'll find",
  "for you too but I know something you'll find advantageous is to really move transfer bring your account to tasty trade the number one brokerage firm in the Galaxy you see him right behind me that's the trade desk um we'd love to have your business so please help us keep the lights on and help me keep this podcast going and all this great content at Tasty live"
