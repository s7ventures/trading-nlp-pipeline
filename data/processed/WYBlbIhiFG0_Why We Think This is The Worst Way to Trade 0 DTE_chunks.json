  "zero dtes we try to give you a variety of zero DTE stuff every week um usually those guys are in the SPX pit so we kind of think it's fun to do it down there but um let's have a little fun with this defending zero DTS the what we decided to look at today was basically stop orders and um because we get a lot of questions and I got a lot of emails just overnight alone on stop orders so I mean we'll give it a shot well what let's do it the the simple bottom line is if you combine um stop orders",
  "bottom line is if you combine um stop orders with smart management you can get away a little bit with some stops if you just think stops are going to protect you with no management you're a dead man dead man walking so you the stop order it was was originally looked at at as um you don't have to look at it anymore like that you have a stop order so your work is done really and what you're saying is your work really isn't done with a stop order yeah right like like a stop order is not is is it's",
  "right like like a stop order is not is is it's not preventive medicine in other words a stop order can complement some smart optimization of early trade management but a stop order on its own is not going to make you money all right in the zero days so using cheap far the money long options allows even smaller the opportunity to sell zero DT premium we have not done a lot of zero DT premium recently because um to be fair you know the markets volatility is low we just haven't done anything we're",
  "is low we just haven't done anything we're record highs y um yeah but when you buy long Wings they're more about buying power control than risk mitigation so stop losses which are standing orders to exit a trade at at a certain market price or you could do stop limit as well um if it if it turns too far against you are a common if unreliable tool in the management mechanics stop orders were big you know many many many moons ago um if you noticed on tasty I think ta I think Tony and I have",
  "on tasty I think ta I think Tony and I have talked about stop orders maybe one time a year for the last 14 years and never once have we ever suggested to use one so it is not part of what we do period mhh managing losers is sure to decrease our percentage of winning trades but how does it affect our net profitability and what stop loss levels have performed best for zero DT trades these are the questions that a lot of people have let's take a next let's go to next slide so we did a study when",
  "let's go to next slide so we did a study when we looked at 50 Delta straddles or 30 Delta strangles at each market open we explored the effect of the stop loss order ranging from 25 to 200% of the initial credit so that means if you sell something for a dollar you're stopping yourself out at $125 or $3 right that's what that means yep yep um for each stop loss level we considered with or um we considered with or with managing winners at 25% of the initial credit that's our that's really our",
  "the initial credit that's our that's really our Target and that's what our research shows is essentially optimal all trades were assumed to be executed at Mid price um now the wings cost extra money and stop orders are less than perfect as far as you know good fills let's put it that way let's go to next slide okay so the first one's the straddles now we don't sell a lot of straddles but um you're going to see first of all that that the win percentage um on straddles is is a little bit iffy um",
  "um on straddles is is a little bit iffy um they're kind of low that's why we don't do a lot of straddles but if you put your stop loss in at 25% if you put your stop loss in at 50% or 100% or 200% you're still all at 50 or less but the scary part is your average p&l for all those numbers is negative so the bottom line basically locking in a basically locking in a loss when you're using a stop loss order doing exactly what it's supposed to do it's giving you a loss you're locking in a loss these",
  "giving you a loss you're locking in a loss these are all locking and losses every stop order straddle at 25% 50% 100% or 200% locked in a loss over time let's go next slide this is two years worth of data now if you do the straddle but you do it side by side with the 25% profit Target your win percentage goes from 40 to 60 from 40 to 70 from 50 to 77 and from 50 to almost 80 all your pnls turn positive so the answer to this the answer to the first question is anybody that trades zero DTE if",
  "first question is anybody that trades zero DTE if you're are going to use the stop order and and this is like this is essentially this isn't just some research this is groundbreaking research if you're going to do zero DTS and you think you're going to make money using stop orders at certain percentage you're you're you're off you're just you're not there's no statistical evidence that anything Works in that case if you want to make money Trading zero DTS and you want to use a stop loss at 25%",
  "zero DTS and you want to use a stop loss at 25% 50% 100% or 200% over time you have to have a 25% profit Target and that's the only way it makes money okay so so so you're saying I have to put in you're not saying both orders right what where are you are you saying putting in both orders like putting in like a bracket order putting in a a stop you're you're you have a you you're buying it you're buying it back for it's not it's not a it's not a one cancels the other just you have to manage the",
  "one cancels the other just you have to manage the trade so if you're going to put a 25% stop loss in you have to have a 25% profit Target first like like no matter what you basically have to have a 25% profit Target across the board yeah across the board no matter what you do okay that's your resting order let's go to next slide okay so 30 Delta strangles it's the exact same thing if you just use a stop loss order the your win percentage is like the same 33 41 50 57 and every single p&l is a",
  "the same 33 41 50 57 and every single p&l is a loss go to the next slide Beth if you add the stop loss in there every single one is a win and your numbers go up from 30 something to 62 73 80 and 86 um it does seem to be an there does seem to be an optimal stop loss here on on on around that 50% doesn't it yeah yeah that seems like when it when it goes It goes well against you yeah yeah the optimal stop loss would probably be between 50 and 100% but the reality is you have to use the 25% profit",
  "but the reality is you have to use the 25% profit Target in order to make money right right so don't get greedy just if you put an order in the zeros put your profit Target at 25% or 20% Then you can put your mental stop or your stop in above that let's go to next slide makes sense I got it yeah so the takeaways are employing stop loss orders to defend Zer TT premium trades without also managing the winners was a recipe for failure when coupled with rapidly taking winners things got more",
  "with rapidly taking winners things got more interesting as with profit targets the zero DT option positions seem to benefit from tighter stoploss orders that's what Tony said around 50 to 100% rather than 200 um and with closer to at the money trades especially performing well when they closed when closed rapidly win or loss so while exiting losers brought down the percentage of winners significantly was also effective at reducing downside exposure and left enough profits to more than cover the",
  "and left enough profits to more than cover the puring Wings Bear in mind that when using stoploss orders that once triggered they will fill out a market price which may be worse than where you set them you can set marketable limits you can set limit orders too"
