what is your game plan for today will it be any different than any other day this is my 11th presidential election since I've been in the trading business and I think every single one of these days is the same my game plan for today is flatten out the positions I want to flatten out keep the risk on that I want to keep on make sure it's the right positions that I want to have on take off or widen some of the trades I really don't care about neutralize the trades I don't care about or close them make sure I have the exact trades on that I want for my wrist trades cross my fingers cross my legs and hope I'm right
