the last 15 minutes of the S&P 500 performance I've got some interesting stats on top of all this when we're done with this segment so we got to move quickly let's go first Slide John the zero DT option sellers can benefit from uh benefit if the stock price stays within a specific range by the day's close so we analyze five minute bars this is based on lots of customer requests of near 4,000 trading days for 16 years and we looked at the final 15 minutes from 2:45 to basically 3:00 3:01 central time when when officially the Bell goes off at 301 the key findings the last 15minute range 85% of the time stays within a quarter of a percent 95% of the time stays within a half a percent and these are just you know these are kind of pretty straightforward statistics and 98.66% of the time stays within 34 of a percent okay now percent movees big yeah yeah especially in like the spy and the SPX so if you go onto the trading platform you'll see like a one to two standard deviation move is around 0.7 so we're just saying that everything clusters around that and the reason we use spy instead of SPX in the study is it's just easier to get spy data for us than SPX because you're dealing with smaller numbers so yeah that's the only thing to point out here you can multiply it by you can multiply it by 10 if you want the SPX yeah so this is the F the first chart is a normal distribution chart shows the range is currently tight 85% of the time it's around a quarter of um a quarter of a percent now just to put a quarter of a percent in perspective um a quarter of a percent is about 15 handles right so just to put some context it's around 15 Handles in the snps like this morning the S&P have moved half a percent that's the whole overnight that is correct we're talking about the last 15 minutes it's about 15 handles now the way the markets are priced like yesterday I sold some calls that were 10 handles above so like you don't get a lot of premium for 15 handles away I'm just telling you right now so it's not like there's a lot of juice there sure let's go next slide when you like talk about percentages uh it can get a little skewed the data but yeah yeah when you talk about percentages it sounds like oh I'm gonna collect a lot of money for this no no no if you go out to 15 you're going to collect about 30 cents and about 15 handles away with 15 minutes to go you know 30 to 40 cents tops if you're going to go inside of that you're going to get maybe a buck so each each TW each quarter of a percent brings you in like another you know goes like goes like 3040 cents a dollar and then it goes like 250 so so believe me they have this down to a science for the last 15 minutes of the Spy um this is interesting so I'm not so sure that you would have guessed this Tony because I for sure thought it was the other way around agreed 48% of the time 48.3 we go higher in the last 15 minutes and 50.2 we go lower seems like higher 100% of the time is what I would have said doesn't it yeah yeah I mean because I'm living it it depends on the years that you use actually before 2020 I think it was slightly like uh higher uh but now obviously because of we including 2020 data and 2022 data into here it's uh it is actually uh closes a lot lower and the interesting part about here is that 1.5% of the time it was actually the same there was no change at all and I thought that number would be a lot lower because I thought there was always going to be change the last 15 minutes in the market so yeah I I'm actually in shock that over the last 16 years the last 15 minutes of the day has more lower days than higher days I'm surprised yeah it's very interesting so 4,000 days of 5 bars during the last 15 minutes shows that 95 5% of the time the Spy the last 15 minutes Falls within a half a percent range now again half percent range is 30 handles so that's big and there's not much juice in that but that's 95% yeah for this graph too especially you can see that the volatility increases so all of our tasty mechanics hold true even when you're talking about the last 15 minutes uh of the trading day where the volatility increases towards the end of the trade just like in a normal 45 DT cycle where the volatility increases and like so you can even think about even though you would not do it uh too much over you can even think about managing just before closing and everything like that just to exit out of the volatility so on this slide we we we we basically take it up a notch so you can see here let's just see the calculation so what am I looking at here so this we just took a day like uh one of the days in January so yeah January 17 just to uh explain this point a little bit further the calcul is uh just math don't get too scared about it that 0.9975 and 1.25 number that we're multiplying by is just the to get the one standard deviation theoretical move so we're saying theoretically 85% of the time the one standard deviation which is plus or minus 0.25% it should be between 596 or 599 and we showed that on this specific day it was 597 which is a minus. 12% move so on this specific day it happened and on most of the days it'll happen like this so if you just pick any random day this is like an interesting chart that you can generate if you go through all the numbers that's really good I like that and this is that same information in table form so like your minimum and your maximum numbers are this is including all of the all of the data so obviously Min - 2 and 3% those two dates were from 2020 when you had the most uh volatility so uh and then your standard deviation your curtosis this is very interesting the curtosis is 41 and if you if you remember any of our studies that have talked about cytosis uh that means that it's uh the number is greater than three that means that the taals are going to be really really uh fat and what that basically means is you're going to have a lot of outlier moves obviously in the SPX throughout 16 years of study it has had a lot of outlier moves so all of our stuff that we've talked about math stuff comes back into the study in this table yeah that's really good I like it like you were talking about yeah there's a lot of information here this is great so 2020 had the highest number of three standard deviation day outli three standard deviation outlier moves and since 2009 the medium count of outlier moves is five per year God that sounds like a lot to me yeah so this graph very important we're not dealing with percentages on this graph we're dealing with actual numbers counts because obviously the amount of times that you're going to be moving three standard deviation is very small and yeah 2020 had the most and un unfortunately we don't have 2008 data over here i' imagine that would also fairly High uh and then yeah the rest of the years are all grafted out too and some of the years you don't get any so well three standard deviation is a lot but um I'm still surprised five for a year that seems like crazy okay now I liveed that too and I would have said it was less yeah you Tred to take out all the bad information from your head yeah you're right you're right yeah you kind of for I would have said I would have said a th% it was less I feel like if we went back to your 2020 broadcast we would hear you guys talking about it every single day how it's moving so much but I'm bad with dates anyway I try to forget about everything but that's but that's why 2020 just skews this thing off well whatever that's that's all so yeah this is just going by the months yeah so this is outlier moves they happen most frequently in March and least frequently in uh July January and December so this is just going through months if you wanted to know that information this data is also a little slightly skewed because obviously March has more trading volume than something like January months that have more trading volume will also have more outlier moves than less but yeah it's interesting to note that right now uh in the January and December period uh do we should not expect too many Aller moves and then as we're heading into February and March we should expect more I think that historically we've had some of the biggest moves ever in March you know whether it's 2000 whether it's 2009 whe you know basically whether it was 2020 March has been you know March is the month no doubt about it I don't think they're going to wait till March this year Tuesday has the smallest mean and median percent move for the Spy the last 15 minutes that's crazy how's that possible you're learning a lot today s so this is just going by the days now so we're just going through all the different data points Monday and Friday uh so you would think from the last slide that Monday and Friday uh are you know they have the most trading Fridays the expiration dates uh they would have the most outlier moves but it's actually just Tuesday and it's uh the blue and the green is just highlighting the mean and the median how much the mean you know excuse the data and why we tend why we use median a lot of the times as well cu the bars between mean and median are uh they have a lot of difference to them but yeah just Tuesday you would never think that I would never never never in a million years let's go to next slide and you tell me this today I missed it now yesterday oh I yes yeah you're all by I have to wait a whole week now we're off by day because of Monday okay that's right that's right takeaways tight trading range spy tends to trade within a smaller range during the last 15 minutes of the trading day Tuesday has the smallest Range on average all right bet Tuesdays we sell on Tuesdays Tuesday we let them have it sell that's right give them with both hands outlier moves are rare and large so three standard deviation moves are very rare um upside outliers are more painful than downside outliers and March has the most outliers huh and then high probability range targets betting that the Spy trades within plus or minus a half a percent of its 245 price was successful 95% the time there's not much juice in that but non-directional defined risk sellers can thrive in that time period mhm yeah and just remember like Tom was mentioning with all this stuff when you hear like 0.5% 0.72% when you're talking about something like spy or even the SPX like a 1% move in the SPX is 60 bucks right now so you are dealing with large dollar moves uh even if the percentages are small over here so yeah you're not gonna get a lot in the Spy I mean you're really gonna have to do you know SPX because the Spy the problem is you have too much uh assignment risk if something moves after hours it's got to be SPX
