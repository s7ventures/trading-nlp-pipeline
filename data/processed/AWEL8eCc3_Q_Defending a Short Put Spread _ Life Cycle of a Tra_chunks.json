  "[Music] what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind the trade entry trade management and the closing order in this video we are going to cover a short put [Music] spread all right so getting another trade on the board here so one stock that has been absolutely hammered over the last couple sessions here is crowd strike obvious had the big news on um uh some of the issues with their software update I don't think it was a hack",
  "their software update I don't think it was a hack but it was big problem obviously and the stock has uh sold off significantly I think this is an opportunity to play into some of the volatility of course when you have this big move volatility tends to expand and volatility is an is an expression of the expected price movement in the underline given that we've had such a big move I think this is a little inflated moving forward so I'm going to look and sell a put spread in September In Crowd",
  "look and sell a put spread in September In Crowd strike so we typically like to sell somewhere around a 20ish Delta I'm going to look at this 230 Mark uh it's right around the lows here of arguably the whole year so if you go back to the beginning of 2024 it was trading somewhere in the 250 24ish range I think that's probably our bottom here um so look at the 230 strike again I'm going to go about $10 wide here so I like to put on about 7 to $800 in in total risk when I'm using uh my positions",
  "in in total risk when I'm using uh my positions in this portfolio so I'm going to look to sell this $10 wide spread you can see it's got about a 70% probability of success that's because we're selling roughly a 20 Delta short option and it trades at a little less than onethird the width of strikes which is what we target when we are selling uh a spread here so we're going to Route this here at 223 see if we get filled no fill there even into the down move which should help with our fills here",
  "down move which should help with our fills here we'll move this down to [Music] 220 no fill there markets are a little wide this is a volatile stock a high price stock so it's not uncommon to have to adjust some of these spreads here there we go we got filled at 2115 as we're adjusting the prices stock down ticked a little bit which helped because we are getting long Delta here so so we are getting bailed out today and the last couple weeks with this price action In Crowd strike we've got the",
  "this price action In Crowd strike we've got the EM mini S&P 500 futures up 50 points uh they've had a vbottom bounce back rally here uh we sold this puts spreading crowd strike with which has been all over the news for the uh problems that they had with their update and all sorts of bad stuff going on here we tried to catch a falling knife uh and unfortunately when we put this position on the stock was trading at 269 it got as low as 200 over the last two weeks or so so we put this trade on on",
  "last two weeks or so so we put this trade on on the 24th here it seemed like it was going to be a bottom spot here it's ried all the way back to to that point we went from from 264 all the way down to 200 back to 262 here uh getting bailed out the on this put spread that is now right at them or a little bit out of the money I should say um but is right at a scratch or so from when we put this position on now you still have very high implied volatility and we're kind of getting bailed out on",
  "and we're kind of getting bailed out on this price action so for me I'm looking to turn this position into a more neutral position I'm still going to stay in it volatility still very very high we got an outof the- money position so I'm comfortable holding that risk but I think given the price action it's time to put a little bit of a hedge on in terms of of some short Delta and some short premium to take advantage of some of that volatility so you can see we've got about a 20ish short Delta put",
  "can see we've got about a 20ish short Delta put and a 16 Delta long put I'm gonna do somewhere around the same thing on the upside so that would put us at like the 310 320 call spread when we look at that on the on the uh on the uh chart here that puts us at risk somewhere above this big gap right so I'm okay with taking risk there I would expect to see a little bit of a v contraction if that does happen too so and a passage of time because that's not going to happen this afternoon at least I",
  "not going to happen this afternoon at least I don't think it's going to um so I'm going to look to sell this at about a140 this will put us at a at $3.50 or 60 credit here which is oneir the width of the strikes it's exactly what we look for on entry with an ion Condor but I'm really just trying to take advantage of this huge move that we've had In Crowd strike so let's see if we can get filled above the mid price here we'll mark we'll we'll put it at 140 which is a little bit above the mid",
  "put it at 140 which is a little bit above the mid price here and and work our order from there so no fill at 140 we'll put this down to 138 I'm going to try and get a penny above the the mid there we go so we sold this at 138 so we've now got uh a total credit of 353 on this position it's currently marked at 337 uh 340 is so I'm up 1015 cents on the trade net net uh nothing nothing really huge but just trying to make an adjustment to this position tur it into more neutral Delta position and",
  "tur it into more neutral Delta position and capture some of that high implied volatility that we're seeing things are working out for our crowd strike position so we've stayed kind of range-bound in this range so we actually haven't made or lost anything on this call spread but it did provide us a little bit of protection if the stock did come down a little bit further so the iron Condor as it stands now uh is currently marked at about a $73 profit now it's a little bit less than what I would",
  "now it's a little bit less than what I would typically Target I typically look to get about 100 Bo out of a $3 y or $3 credit position $353 is my net credit on this whole position but I did sell the original put spread at $2 so you know 75 or so would be about you know onethird of that about 30% of the max profit from the original position but the stock does have earnings coming up so you can see earnings are on the 28th which is the middle of this week the stock uh obviously very vol mod it",
  "this week the stock uh obviously very vol mod it has moved significantly in both directions I think rather than holding it through a binary event like earnings I'd rather just take the money and run so I'm going to take the money and run and see if we can get filled on a position here or a closing order here for a couple bucks so when we're closing out of the positions you right click on the um on the ask price for your short option so you're buying to close you're selling to close on the long",
  "to close you're selling to close on the long option which is on the bid same thing on the upside side we're buying to close the short selling to close the um long option here from our order chains you can see we're making a couple bucks on this uh on this little bit of a move lower here on the call spread uh but altogether it should be around somewhere around a 70 Cent profit um let's see if we can get filled at exactly 7 cents which would be a 283 debit uh would would put us at a 73 or a $70",
  "283 debit uh would would put us at a 73 or a $70 profit no fill there we'll go cancel and replace move this up to 285 and there's our fill so we got filled at 285 on this iron Condor you can see once you route the trades together they were in two separate chains the chains come together uh that's on the tast trade platform it's a great feature uh so it chains both those orders together because we closed them together um you can see it made $68 on them I sold the original put spread at 215 sold",
  "them I sold the original put spread at 215 sold the call spread at 138 and closed it out today $2.85 debit for a $68 profit nice little trade avoiding earnings was the key to this one comment below on what strategy you'd like me to cover next if you want to catch these trades live tune in to Johnny trades every Wednesday at 9:40 a.m. on tasty live peace"
