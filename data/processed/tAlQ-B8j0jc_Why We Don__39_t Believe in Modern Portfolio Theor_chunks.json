  "move towards to optimize your risk-return profile. The goal is to find a balance between maximizing returns on the Y-axis and minimizing risk on the X-axis, considering the standard deviations and risk parameters of the assets. It's important to understand that achieving zero risk with high returns is not feasible. Focus on aligning your portfolio with the green line on the curve for optimal results.",
  "expert content editor, I would revise the text to:\n\nIn modern portfolio theory, the efficient Frontier represents the optimal balance between risk and return in a portfolio.

  "returns at much less risk can still be considered a victory. Achieving lower returns with lower volatility may not be underperformance, but actually better.",
  "Many people overlook this step, but it's important to slow down and control the mechanism. Understanding the risks involved is crucial. It's important to follow the proper protocol.",
  "I agree that benchmarks can be misleading because you are competing against the amount of risk you are taking. Benchmarking against the level of risk is essential.",
  "Many people benchmark to a major index, which makes sense at a basic level. However, it's important to quantify the amount of risk being taken. The option Frontier minimum variance offers even lower risk.",
