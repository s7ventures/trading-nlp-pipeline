cuz we're going to talk about the black Scholls model and I I mean I had a talk with a a very intelligent uh econ PhD person who is like how can you spend so much time talking about black schs model when we just know objectively that it's not true and so I felt like I needed to really explain like even though it's not true where the value comes from like why it's a good thing to sort of frame everything else in terms of and and I came up with this uh heliocentric analogy and so we'll we'll we'll get through that okay uh so blackrolls model um right when you come up with a financial model the the goal at least for in an options world is to come up with some sort of way to model the how prices behave so that you can get a a you know a tractable solution for for how much an option should cost right it doesn't help if you have some really abstract model that the math doesn't come out of and you don't R it with values at the end um so we're going to that that's the goal that that's what's set out as the goal here and there's a couple of uh observations you do one is that well firstly it's got to be in terms of returns right the the scale of things can't matter right splits shouldn't really affect things right the it has to be in terms of returns um and then straight returns you know the current price divided by the previous price the future price divided by the current price those don't add together right they multiply together right if you want to know the price two years from now you need to multiply the returns one year from now and the returns between one in two years from now um and you could do that um but we don't have as many theorems that apply to multiplication as as we do to addition and so we just do this algebraic trick and we take the logs and this is why we care about log returns we've talked about this before um that it's it's this kind of convenient trick that turns multiplication into addition and that means that we can use our theorems like the central limit theorem um if we kept it in terms of returns we'd wind up with some sort of geometric Central limit theorem which would say that the product of a bunch of independent random variables is a geometric is a log is a log normally distributed and we end up in the same place but the math would be a little bit less familiar for the mathematically inclined um so we're going to talk in log returns and then we look at sort of just the weak efficient market hypothesis says that you're going to have Independence over D joint time intervals and then here's where the big untrue right the the false assumption comes in and we say the underlyings are time homogeneous right that they don't have distinct periods right that they're always behaving roughly the same you know you don't get the same output all the time but the probabilistically it's all the same um if we had that and Independence over Destro time intervals we'd get the central limit theorem would apply because we could cut it into a lot of little pieces say that it's all any any long span is the sum of many short spans each of the short spans are the same and independent so total they have to be normal and we got the central limit theorem and then we arrive so we get that log returns are going to evolve as Brownian motions Central limit theorem says that it's normals bring motions are the sums of a bunch of normals um and so that that gets us the whole black Rolls model that's the whole justification uh let's roll forward one Beth and then the output of that is exactly what we were hoping for a relatively convenient closed form expression for the fair price of an option given some inputs right if you have the strike the time until expiration the current the current spot price and this Sigma parameter which we're going to call volatility later but for now it's sort of a morphous parameter and the idea is that the sigma squared is the infant tmal variation on the Brownian motion that's driving our log returns so it's how Wiggly it is how fast it's moving um per unit time um and this is the one not directly observable piece but because the formula strictly increasing in terms of it if we have market prices we can invert the formula and get an implied volatility and that's sort of the the you know where we get a lot of the meat out of our use of the black sholls model is it's where we get our implied volatilities from right there's no hon model implied volatility because you'd also have a volatility a volatility parameter and there' be a whole Space of possibilities that explain current prices so the nice thing about black formula is that a single price turns into a single volatility in a nice one to one uh way unfortunately let's roll forward the market prices don't support the black shols model right it said that they should they should be the the sigma should be a property of the underlying and in but in actuality when you look at different options even on the same underlying they give different sigmas they in incompatible values for the implied volatility you get this surface right where if you look at different strikes and different times until expiration you get different implied volatilities typically they go up away from the spot and out about in time but that the important part is this that it's not flat right if the if black charoll model is true this picture would just be a flat plane but it's not um right so this is what we're saying the black trolls model isn't true why do we put up with it then why do we keep talking about it why do we keep using it well let's go for it one and we'll we'll see um sort of the thing we keep using it because there's never going to be a true financial model in in the way that these people want right when you have a physical model oh Tom's falling asleep oh no to go to sleep on you I no we have a physical model right like how a ball flies through the air we can model we can write down our formulas for how we think it's going to happen we have someone kick the ball we observe how the ball flies and we can check oh how good was our model did it describe how the ball flew yes or no um social sciences wind up with this this problem called The Observer Paradox that prevents them from modeling things well where when you ask people questions they change their answers all right you people behave differently when they know they're being watched um but financial math hasn't even deeper problem which is sort of a describer Paradox where the models that you make influence how people trade which then influences the prices that are trying to be modeled so the the model influences its own output um right so this picture on the bottom right is 1987 which is before 1987 people really like the black shs model so much that they priced all the options as if it was absolutely true and then 1987 people realiz well maybe that's not right and there was a big crash about it and can you guys tell me why is there so much paper in in the air how did that happen What 198 1987 proved the model wrong right I mean they were equally priced on each side so that's why they had to change it and put in skew right I mean it wasn't that Traders got around and said oh we have to change the model it was no the the appetite for downside protection changed forever in the market even to this day and that's why you have skew why is there so much paper in the air that's really kind of false like we didn't throw paper in the air the last day of the year or the or maybe if there was a big Market move or something like that people would throw paper I threw paper every day up in the air yeah I took all my all my your your receipts all my receipts ripped them in a little tiny piece that's why everybody had an out trade with you cuz you didn't keep your receipts I kept my receipts the morning I reconcile can I say something about this the the reason that there was the reason that it wasn't necessary that it was exact was because anytime you're first building a product the markets are wide enough that it made up for the um for small inefficiencies and inaccuracies because remember everything was wide nothing was decimalized and um and you could all they really needed black shells to do was to create um a pricing a a a symmetrical model that you could price everything off of because everything was done in everybody's heads so that's one of the reasons that it suffered from some of the inefficiencies you know over the years obviously as as the business grew everything became a lot more um measured and efficient and then therefore black shells got significantly better as everybody tweaked it mhm everyone sort of dialed in and made it more and more accurate until someone decided they really wanted some downside protection we didn't even have computers we didn't even have computers back then we used to figure out by hand so and then and then you know and then the handheld computers were really weak so it wasn't like it wasn't something that's that simple so that's where all the inefficiency came from the Brilliance of the model is that everybody stayed with it because it worked so good and it was just it was really able to just you know everybody was able to customize it and and use it as the foundation the blue this is what I'm saying right there's this description thing right it works so well because everyone was using it okay until people until people start disagreeing with it and then it stops working all of a sudden because well believe me even when we built toss we tried to use we tried to put multiple models on the platform because we weren't even sure if black shs was good enough you know so we used multiple models but but in the end and they didn't really matter exactly I think that's right so I think that the thing is that the black sholls model isn't true but it is really useful as the frame of reference and we go forward one the way to think about this is so the ancient Greeks were pretty good at astronomy right they looked at the stars and the planets and the sky and they measured them every day and they wrote it down and then they started doing some math to figure out where they thought things were going to be in the future and they they did it they they you know they they tracked the position of Mars in the sky um every let's Mo move forward one but their formulas for how these planets move are really complicated looking because if you're looking at Mars relative to Earth it comes it it mostly moves around Earth in a circle but it does these like little loop-de-loops because in fact they're both going around the Sun in in pretty stable ellipses and but if you don't focus on the Sun instead you focus on Earth you get this you know this this geocentric model which has this very complicated formula for the motion of Mars um and it took until the cernus to say wait if we instead of using Earth as our Center we shift the center of the solar the center of all the planets to the sun then all the formulas become these very simple equations everything's just a very stable ellipse and then their positions relative to each other make a lot of sense and you don't have this defer and epicycle that's trying to measure these interactions between these multiple periods everything is much more straightforward um by picking the right frame of reference in the same way the black shs model isn't true right no underlying behaves like a black sh's underlying but at the same time if you're trying to describe how an underlying is behaving if you just try to do it raw on its own terms just straight from the thing you wind up like the Greeks doing their astronomy with these very convoluted conceptions but if instead you take black schs as a baseline as a frame of reference and you say okay how different from a black schs underlying is this underlying then you can look at the implied volatility surface and say oh okay it's it's got heavier Tails because the surface curves up at the at the sides um right and that that's a much more direct way to read sort of properties of it we can go forward yeah especially because I think most people um have some amount of familiarity with the log with the normal distribution um because of the central limit theorem normal distribution show up all the time in life you know this 30 68% in the middle another 26 or 27% of kind of a one to two standard deviation wings and then these thing you know these out past the these outlier moves all these things are much easier to interpret via using the black schs model as a as a Baseline and then judging how different the current market prices say the underlying is from that right you don't doubt the current market prices but you interpret them via the black schs model to get a much more intable thing right you can look at the implied volatility surface and get a really firm grasp of what the market says about this underlying right is gme has all this has all this call skew most underlines have all this put skew that means that you've got you know big moves in that way and small moves in the other way and if you were just looking at the option prices directly it'd be almost impossible to figure out sort of on your own how to do it without you know decades and Decades of experience uh working on it and so I think that's sort of my point is that the black sholls model is wrong but it is also very right to like use it as your foundational the foundation of your understanding because it's the most clear picture in the same way that if you're trying to model where Mars is it'd be wrong to say that Mars is where the sun is but it is much more helpful to start by looking at the sun and then measure the position of Mars from there I get that and that's it the blacks model is not an accurate description of the underlying price Dynamics um but this isn't such a strike against it because there will never be a perfect financial model um right because model affects the system itself um and using the black of the Baseline can make viewing the market much more intelligible in the same way that heliocentrism simplifies astronomy right if you want to think about Mars moving in a circle or lips you don't want to think about Mars moving in loop-de-loops the same way you want to think about the Spy moving as a put skewed underlying not just an unintelligible randomly moving object
