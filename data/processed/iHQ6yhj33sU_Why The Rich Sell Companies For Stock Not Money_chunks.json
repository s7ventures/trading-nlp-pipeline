  "if you had to give yourself a grade on taking the TD mer trade stock A+ F minus where where well we took the stock at 11 or $12 so I don't remember the exact price but it was around let's say $12 it never traded lower so that was a good trade and what do you think you ended up selling it at probably between 18 and 30 so you really sold for way more than $750 million once you actually got out of the position here but don't tell anybody yeah I won't"
