  "a history of scary moves where do you think the team's going with this one Mr batist I have no idea I really don't I mean unless they're looking at like you know the five to 10 per moves I don't know I mean it is Thanksgiving Thanksgiving themed you know so um but a history of scary moves let's take a look and see where the boys are going with this one for new Traders large moves in underline can result in the stuff of short premium nightmares yeah like a 50 point up move at S&S today after",
  "yeah like a 50 point up move at S&S today after being down 100 yesterday that's not the stuff that I love but experienced option Traders know that it's unexpected moves that are really scary to help us decide on strike placement implied volatility times the square root of time until expiration gives us expected moves at any time scale how reliable have the expected moves been and does the answer depend on what time frame we look at you want to tackle that it's a I mean I mean it's a it's a",
  "to tackle that it's a I mean I mean it's a it's a tough one here I mean how reliable expect the moves be I'm going to say 80 I'm going to say 75% of the time how reliable of expected moves been I'm gonna say very yeah sure 75 or higher and how reliable good does the answer depend on what time frame you look at sure and yeah sure I'm gonna agree yeah so I'm saying they're very reliable and it does depend of the time frame I think the shorter you go the more accurate it is and the longer you go",
  "go the more accurate it is and the longer you go the less accurate it is but the best way to take advantage of it is somewhere in between that's like that 45 day thing I think if you go out like a year or something it's really hard to know what the expected move is and if you're going out one day that's reasonable but you know again it's harder to profit from that so we did a study using 20 years worth of data we observed the realized spy returns at the daily weekly monthly and annual scales",
  "at the daily weekly monthly and annual scales using the vix derived expected moves for that time scale we checked how many times the expected move realized um the moves turned out to be and we observed how frequently the realized move was at least one time two times or three times the expected move in Black Shaw's Theory Theory land these frequencies would be 32 4.6 and 0.3 that's one two and three standard deviations one times two times and three times would be 32 4.6 and 0.3 so on The Daily",
  "times would be 32 4.6 and 0.3 so on The Daily moves and and again you know remember you're comparing this 20 1.9 and 0.3 to 32 4.6 and 0.3 so the realized moves and then the frequency of the the expected move you know obviously the daily moves it's going to be way under because it has to be okay and that stays in line with everything we talk about in the show let's sell the Delhi premium and hopefully we keep the difference sure so we go from daily moves to weekly moves and in the weekly move",
  "moves to weekly moves and in the weekly move world the numbers are even we would argue the numbers are even better so you go from 32 to 17 from 4.6 to 1.6 and from 0.3 to 0.4 that doesn't really matter but you're talking about you know again on a weekly basis the realized moves are a fraction of the whatever the expected move is supposed to be so it fits the scenario that we talk about all the time let's go to the next slide so now we look at monthly moves and monthly moves are not that much",
  "monthly moves and monthly moves are not that much different from the weekly move moves not that much different from the daily moves and at 16 1.5 and 0.4 daily weekly and monthly all makes sense for the tasty methodology there's nothing scary about this um I mean you're going to have outliers that bring everything into line but that's the nature of the business sure otherwi otherwise there'd be no premium to sell otherwise there'd be no business yes as soon as you get to annual moves remember",
  "yes as soon as you get to annual moves remember how I said before when you go out to like an annual move it's much harder you know I can't predict something a year from now as well as I can predict something a week from now when you go out to the annual moves you can see that the difference between theoretical which is 32 and actual which is 30 is not that great and the difference between two times you expect between 4.6 and 2.4 that's still okay but you don't get a lot of like two times",
  "okay but you don't get a lot of like two times expected move like that's the you know that's kind of the regulatory threshold the real one is on the onetime expected move because that's where we set up most of our trades like we're not doing our trades at five five deltas and three delt Deltas we're doing our trades at you know 16 Deltas 20 Deltas in that range so one of the arguments for not going out to trade to short premium in the leaps is you just don't have that much of an advantage",
  "is you just don't have that much of an advantage exactly because volatility has so much time to change so much premium built in the first one of these slides with the with the daily moves you can see that the daily moves here at least one time the expected the daily moves are at 20 and 1.9 are less attractive then the weekly and monthly moves so when you look here at the weekly moves this is very attractive compared to the Daily and the annual if you go to the monthly which is the next one",
  "if you go to the monthly which is the next one which is how we calculate most of the things on tasty this is the best and that's why we go out to 45 days because it's just over that one month period and this has the lowest frequency and the best numbers all around and this is where we live you know why would you do why would you do the yearly when the monthly is you know is twice as good you know seriously I don't know like why would you why would anyone I mean if you see this no I but you know",
  "anyone I mean if you see this no I but you know what they think you know I'm going further out there's more premium to sell that kind of thing you know why do it every month you know let me try to do the the easier path sometimes the easier path is not the most uh economical I guess yeah no listen I completely understand I think that this is just an interesting it's an interesting discussion and I think that um it explains a lot let's go to the last Slide John do the takeaways all the daily and",
  "Slide John do the takeaways all the daily and weekly levels the vix did a consistent job of overestimating Market moves since the vix is compiled from the 30-day option prices it makes sense that looking at outlier monthly told a very clear story of 2008 and 2020 for all three realiz moves surpassed expect to move far less frequently than black shs theoretical or so-called IV over overestimate and um overstatement at the annual time frames the market clustered more closely around around one",
  "market clustered more closely around around one expected move only breaking three times the expected move during the beginning of 2008 so essentially just arguing that the the annuals just so much more difficult this plays into why long-term leaps are unappealing for retail sellers because they generate very little Theta uh for their buying power and the strikes at the expected move you know lack significant implied volatility overstatement only 30% instead of 32 and the other ones were down to",
  "30% instead of 32 and the other ones were down to 16 so it's just a study that says hey this is why we do what we do in our world we have to be less right to be successful good job good job about you s I like the way you navigated your way through those slot"
