so why don't you guys ever trade stocks after it's been announced that the company is a takeover Target sometimes the buyout price is well above where the underlying is currently trading but you guys stay away why would you just buy those stocks there we really feel like you're picking up pennies in front of a steam roller I mean you know and if the deal falls apart you end up losing big and if the deal does go through the way it way it is you make pennies when the buyout price is well above where the underlying is trading the discount is very measured and it's theoretically accurate because it accounts for the risk of the deal not going through for regulatory reasons or for corporate reasons whatever it is the reason that we stay away from it is because all the excess premium is generally immediately sucked out of that deal and all you're doing is trading the difference between the buyout price and where it's currently trading which to us is not a game we want to play there's not a lot of edge in that game
