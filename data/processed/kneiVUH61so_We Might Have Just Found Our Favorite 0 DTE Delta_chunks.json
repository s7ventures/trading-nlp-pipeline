  "profit targets by Delta for zero GT part of our zero GT discussion let's see what we got is this going to be complicated cuz I'm a little tired from yesterday Russell down three it's really complicated managing winners is the Cornerstone of tasty methodology by taking profits aggressively we ensure a high percentage of updates when the trades are going well using a higher profit Target will bring home more of it but Som days things turn against you right mhm okay what we have what have been the",
  "right mhm okay what we have what have been the best performing profit targets for short zero DT premium and has it depended on the distance out of the money you want to take a guess I'm um I'm hoping it's in the 20ish Delta range it's probably going to be closer to the 35ish Delta range that's my guess if that's you're hoping it's in the 20ish Delta range with my short strike I think they're only doing strangles here right because they're not buying the wings is that correct they um they're not",
  "the wings is that correct they um they're not doing buy there's no wings right yeah let's take a look and see if Tony is correct using 21 months worth of data now we examine selling strangles every day at the market open and with a variety of Delta ranging from 50 to 15 for each Delta we considered the long-term performance of the hypothetical traders who manage the trades at different fixed percentages of the initial credit so the question becomes if you manage it 15% or 50% of the initial",
  "if you manage it 15% or 50% of the initial credit where do you do better it's a little confusing because what happens here and you're going to see this starting on the next slide is I think it's going be a higher Delta than I'm that I'm gonna like that's my that's going to be my call what's going to happen okay just hear me out of this is the higher the Delta the strangle like a straddle or a high Delta strangle yeah the quicker you have to manage yeah or you're dead Okay okay I think you're",
  "yeah or you're dead Okay okay I think you're going to get that opportunity if you get wider then you can wait a little bit longer but if you do it if you don't do it quick in a stra that makes sense okay least makes sense to me this is the cumulative performance of the 50 Delta um straddles MH okay Cuma of performance 50 Delta straddles so what's happening here is if you look at the Top Line that's in blue it's hard to see but if you look at the Top Line That's profit Target of 15% 15% 15%",
  "the Top Line That's profit Target of 15% 15% 15% blows away everything else sure if you waited until 35 or 50% profits you don't do that well yeah you can see that's the that's that um reddish line down at the bottom that's followed by that purple line yeah that's the 35 and 50% uh Target the 25% is the yellow line um yep that seems to do okay too I mean it's in sign profits on the left hand side right 3 $1 or whatever yeah yeah yeah yep you do significantly better significantly yeah when you",
  "significantly better significantly yeah when you um manage early on a big Delta strangle or straddle in this case let's go to the next slide Beth so the next one is going to be 40 and what happens at 40 is you can go up a little bit now you can go to 25% and you kind of have you know you're okay look at look at that straddle you're a you're a loss uh yep if you wait if you wait yeah this is a 40 Delta we're only showing this because this is such a cool way to premium working for you yeah go to",
  "a cool way to premium working for you yeah go to the next slide Beth so this one is the 30 Delta and in the 30 Delta it's also 25% so if you if you sell a straddle like you sell both at the money options in the zero days you got to manag in 15% if you move a little bit further out of the money like 40 and 30 Deltas we're usually at 20 if you move 40 or 30 then you can do it maybe wait till 25% 15 25% go to the next slide because this is where we are at we're at the 20% number at the 20% number",
  "are at we're at the 20% number at the 20% number okay which is the one we sell you can wait until you get 15% you see that yeah I do okay yeah I do so you I'm sorry you can wait till get 35% 35% and so so this is the 35% number so it's just it as you get price target of 50% not so great sou enough if you as you get further out of the money you can you can go to a higher percentage mhm okay and um battle not doing well at all let's go to next slide Beth the next one's going to be 15 and at 15",
  "Beth the next one's going to be 15 and at 15 it's still the same thing it's 35% mhm so what the research team wanted to show you was that if you sell something out the money you got to manage really early if you if you sell something further out of the money you can give yourself a little cush yes yes and you could hold out for a little bit more I did a I did I did a guest podcast the other day for somebody that was doing zero DTS and he asked a question just like this and we hadn't finished",
  "a question just like this and we hadn't finished this study yet but because this is a brand new study but it that's really interesting and um anyway super interesting study that that as you get further out of the money you can go from 15 to 35% in expected profits have the same kind of targets and and by the way you can do 25% across the board you're great yeah it seems well the closer to the to the money the zero TTS were traded the more important it was to take profits quickly for straddles",
  "it was to take profits quickly for straddles 15% profit Target was the most successful while the more typical was a 25% range that's what I just said the further out of the money at the 20 Delta 15 Delta 35% profit did best but and 15 did even worse at 50 so just you know that 25 to 35 Perfect The Profit Target management does little for controlling risk the bad losers that never went green hit just as hard but pairing the right strikes and management can set you up for long-term success"
