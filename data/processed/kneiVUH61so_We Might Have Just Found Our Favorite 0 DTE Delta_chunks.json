  "Profit targets are a key part of our trading strategy. Managing winners is crucial for success. By taking profits aggressively, we increase our chances of success. Using higher profit targets can result in bigger gains, but there are days when trades may not go as planned.",
  "What are the best performing profit targets for short zero DT premium? It is likely closer to the 35ish Delta range. They are only doing strangles here, not buying the wings.",
  "credit, which approach would have yielded better results over the 21-month period?",
  "If you manage 15% or 50% of the initial credit, it can be confusing to determine which is better. Starting on the next slide, you will see a higher Delta with a strangle or high Delta strangle. The higher the Delta, the quicker you need to manage or you will be at risk.",
  "If you widen your position, you may have a better opportunity. The cumulative performance of the 50 Delta straddles is shown in the blue line, with a profit target of 15%.",
  "The profit target of 15% outperforms higher targets of 35% and 50%. The yellow line representing 25% also performs well. It is evident that sticking to the 15% target yields better results.",
  "When managing a large Delta strangle or straddle, at a 40 Delta, consider taking profits at 25%. This strategy can help maximize premium gains.",
  "This slide shows the 30 Delta, which is at 25%. Selling a straddle with at the money options requires managing at 15%. Moving slightly out of the money to the 40 and 30 Deltas, typically at 20%, may allow waiting until 25%. Currently, we are at the 20% number.",
  "We are currently at the 20% mark, which is where we sell. You can wait until it reaches 15%. As it reaches 35%, you can set a price target of 50%. If it goes further out of the money, aim for a higher percentage. Let's move on to the next slide, which will be at 15%.",
  "The next trade will be at 15% with the same 35% risk. The research team suggests managing trades early when selling out of the money. Selling further out of the money can provide a cushion and potentially higher returns. Zero DTS strategies were discussed in a recent podcast.",
  "In a new study, it was found that as you move further out of the money, expected profits can increase from 15% to 35% with the same targets. Taking profits quickly is more important for straddles closer to the money.",
  "Taking profits quickly for straddles at a 15% profit target was the most successful strategy. Straddles with a 25% profit range were also effective. Further out of the money options at the 20 Delta and 15 Delta had a 35% profit, while the 15 Delta had a 50% loss. Pairing the right strikes and effective management can set you up for long-term success."
