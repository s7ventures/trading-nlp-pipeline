  "What percentage of my portfolio should I allocate to crypto? Crypto is one of the best performing assets. I was underweighted in crypto by a lot, currently at 1% or less. It's a small percentage of my portfolio. A study showed that allocating 1-3% to crypto had virtually no downside and significant upside due to its volatility and potential for gains.",
  "It makes sense to have one to three percent upside. Depending on your age and market perspective, a couple of percent is a no-brainer. We have less than 1% due to selling on the way up."
