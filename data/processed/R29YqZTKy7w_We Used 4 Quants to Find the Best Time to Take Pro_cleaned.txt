there's a couple of different ways to look at profit targets right there is you can say you want to make 50% of the credit you receive right that's one way yeah yeah you can say we're going to manage a 21 DTE wherever it is that's like one of the things we do right yep th those are I wouldn't call either of those two Dynamic those are kind of like static right you're either managing at 50% or you're managing at 21dt but what if you just gave a little flexibility like what if you made um more money sooner like you put a position on today and it actually worked okay all right that would be something so if you want to take profits let's say 25% that would be dynamic right yeah I got I got emails about this last night people volatility contracted they caught a good volatility run here and they're saying hey do I wait to 21 days or do I close stuff this is very timely um let's let's take a look at the first slide so when it comes to option trading management mechanics can make all the difference this is one of the key takeaways that Tony and I have learned in the last couple of years that the management mechanics are make a big big difference at Tasty we generally favor locking in profits looking at the 50th um looking for 50% of the credit received for short option position but is this too rigid that is a good question a common scenario is a trade that makes a good profit but shive the 50% early in its lifespan should we capture 25% profit after one week or should we hold out a bit longer let's explore the effects of adjusting our profit targets looking for more profit from trades that stay on longer and be willing to take a quick buck when things go really early that would be kind of the definition of dynamic let's go to the next slide so 15 years worth of data spy Q's iwm 30 Delta strangles 45 days expiration contrasted the results of several management techniques closing positions at 50% of Max profit waiting one week to avoid closing tiny winners immediately after opening them and then closing positions if they reach a larger percentage of Max profit um of the maximum profit percentage of the duration that had elapsed so so what all that means is if you make money in a shorter period of time what does all that what does all that mean means it means if you make if you don't get to 50% but you make like a pro-rated like you make 25% instead of getting to 50% in 24 days let's say you get to 25% in a week or 10 days you take your profits okay that's Dynamic and then there's closing positions at 21 days win or lose and then there's also Le leaving all the positions in through expiration okay so there's four choices here 21 days expiration dynamic or 50% all right you good with that Okie doie yep yep okay no I just want to make sure we're we're good okay so let's go to the next slide all right so this is the Spy now interesting remember the the four columns 50% um 79% of the time Dynamic 82 21 days 75 and expiration 68 we've already we're going to rule out expiration because we don't do that at all right sure we're not hold to the end of we are kind of the 21 days would be I would say that we're between Dynamic and 21 days what would you say agreed agreed dynamic in 21 days okay and matter of fact matter of fact in on my podcast I'm more Dynamic than I am 21 days but sure okay I'm I think I'm more 21 days but it doesn't really matter we're we're in kind of agreement when you look at these numbers 50% kind of is pretty good the 21 days has the lowest sear which is where we are that's what we're trying to do is reduce the risk but so that that that's that's impressive but there none of these are none of these are supposed to be dramatically better than anything else they're all supposed to just have their you know like to give you some insight into what do you think is optimal yep so for the Spy you know I'm pretty happy with the 21 days that we do because the low sear and the decent um win percentage if you're Dynamic like the bad is you know you're going to be fine with the higher win percentage just less profits because you're managing early yep and if you're waiting for the 50% you can't complain about that either yep um and even expiration in this case worked let's go to the next one Johan so the next one's iwm now the first thing you notice about I it's a smaller product all the numbers are going to be lower um the weird thing here is that the 21dt here the wi percentage a little lower but the profits are higher and the C bar is lower this one 21 days in iwm seems fine but if you did the 50% and you did the dynamic those are also fine MH like bat would do Dynamic here 85% in $23 is is better than 50% sure sure with a lower seabar but I just like ringing the register on the podcast trade just to show people that you can do this you know yeah I understand ringing the register and then and then you make your judgment from there you know maybe you don't have as many positions that I have on and you'd like to you know hang in there a little bit longer but at least the whole our whole thing is about doing something actively and sometimes doing something actively is doing nothing but you're you're not just setting it and forgetting it you're you're actively watching your portfolio which is what I want people to do I mean so many people uh have the bestman advisors or they just put things in funds they they don't even know the symbol to the funds that they're in or what they have on or if they're even mirroring the market so I like you to watch I I want you to be active that's what I'm trying to do um look for opportunity let's go to the next slide which is the cues and in the cues it's weird because they've had such a big up move you know that that the p&l numbers are just not that good for strangles but um here you know you'd be again the 21 days stands out as the lowest siar um but from a profitability standpoint and a win percentage you know the 50% or the dynamic is you know I mean personally after looking at these you got to go dynamic or 21dt the 50% sounds good but it's hard to know that is after all the adjustments beautiful um let's go to the next slide um so some of the takeaways the dynamic management um averaged closing trades with around 23 days to expiration for both spy and iwm while failing to outperform the 21dt management but for more volatile things like the q's uh being willing to to rapidly capture modest profits resulted in closing trades with an average of 31 DT and improved your trade p&l Dynamic profits were re were a reasonable alternative to harden fast 50% goals for the active Trader who does not depend on limit orders but only early management win or lose was a substantial Safeguard against bad losers you know um I think one of the things that the research team pointed out here um is that you can see how close all of these results really are and I would say that there isn't a clear winner except holding to expiration doesn't really make a lot of sense for us and the problem with 50% is that it's hard to tell what 50% is after you've made a bunch of adjustments so managing the trades early and dynamically or doing it at 21 days makes the most sense to me
