has there been any research on doing a wheel strategy in the spy for zero DTE options over the last 10 15 20 years I mean we've gone straight up basically so I would imagine this strategy would do better than even the return over that same period of time yeah it is a bullish strategy and and you got to remember something zero days are a little different well whatever put you sell you're going to get x amount of dollar sport there's not much you can do during the day so you might be pretty far underwater so the reason we haven't done any research on a wheel strategy for zero days is I personally don't really think it's an appropriate strategy for zero days I mean could you do it of course but it wouldn't be something that we recommend
