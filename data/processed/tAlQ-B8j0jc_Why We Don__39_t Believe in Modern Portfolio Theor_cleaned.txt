right well modern portfolio Theory it's been a few decades Tom it's been a few decades since uh this thing's been updated I think it's overdue what do you think it's ironic and we're gonna I'm G to kind of skip over the the backstory uh you know uh well actually no let's just let's get into it John hit us on the intro slide so let's not jump the shark here uh uh too quickly okay so modern portfolio theory is one of the core pillars of academic finance and has been so for many many decades which is ironic in and of itself if you just kind of read that sentence with claim to fame being a mathematical construction of the optimal weightings between risky assets to achieve the best balance of risk and return but modern quote unquote modern portfolio Theory does not include any type of derivatives so if it did could it be improved so gentlemen my question for you here this morning is do you think you can even have something in 2025 titled modern portfolio theory that does not incl include derivatives no I wouldn't say I would say no also I had to think about that though I mean I I completely agree I completely agree with you I mean in the world that we live in now and especially I mean the retail Trader retail investor access that we have to the platforms and the technology and the products it's like man I you know I don't know how you can still have something called modern portfolio theory that essentially hasn't changed for for many many many decades and that's exactly what we're going to talk about here this morning is if we did begin to include something like derivative exposure into our portfolios how would modern portfolio Theory change now I know and I mentioned this from time to time when I think it's applicable there are a lot of graduate students doctoral students that watch our content that have reached out to me about various things over the years if you are a graduate student right now or you are a doctoral student right now and you are trying to think of a disputation or thesis topic this is something to put in the old back of the Noggin that could be an option for you so something like this that could kind of update what we've you know been using for many many decades just a shout out there to our our academic students that might be out there all right so John Hennis here on the next slide so this is here's kind of the cou d' gr here's kind of the claim to fame here's kind of like the the Jared gof right of academic Finance the Capital Market line so in modern portfolio Theory what you're essentially trying to figure out is what is the optimal ratio between two risky assets so you have a portfolio that's two risky assets you have risky asset a and risky asset B and you're trying to figure out you know what is the optimal combination of these two Assets in my portfolio well here is what modern portfolio Theory essentially shows us and I'm skipping over a bunch of steps I'm skipping over like you know risk-free rates I'm I'm skipping over like betas tangential lines I mean all that stuff is here but I kind of want to get to the to the meat and potatoes if if you look at the portfolio return on the y- AIS and the portfolio risk on the x-axis what you see in a portfolio construction is kind of this funny looking curve like this backward bending curve that kind of shows you what the weightings between A and B would look like well here are some important points and observations about this curve again this is standard modern portfolio theory that at time I think this was developed in the 50s in the 1950s Tom it's been 70 years 70 years this thing hasn't changed what do you think about that for somebody who likes a lot of change I think is his point I I'm okay with change yes I'm has changed in 70 years I'm not a purist that's so that's so surprising to me you're you're so I mean for being for being as old as you are the fact that you're so open to change is man that's really a testament to you I got to give it to you I don't that be the only thing we give him portfolio return portfolio risk okay two points number one in portfolio theory in portfolio Theory you always have what it's referred to as the minimum variance portfolio so there are a lot of conservative investors out there a lot of conservative Traders out there that they kind of want to know all right where's the point where I can achieve a modest level of return but really take my risk down to the lowest possible level like what is that point where does that exist well that of course is going to be on this curve you see that right there as the minimum variance portfolio then the green segment the highlighted green segment that is above that portfolio these are going to be all the combinations between asset a and asset B that offer you an optimal balance between risk and return because if you look at that graph you always want to move if you could you always want to move to the upper left you always want to move to the northwest of that graph you always want to go higher on the Y AIS to improve your return and you want to go lower on the xais so to the left to reduce your risk but because of the various standard deviations and the various you know risk parameters of the two assets there's only so much you can do you can't just Peg your portfolio with all returning no risk that's not possible of course but when you think about the green line that's on this curve this is where you want to live in modern portfolio theory that is referred to as the efficient Frontier because all of those portfolios are efficient none of them are dominated from a risk return standpoint any dot on that green line is going to give you the best possible breakdown and combination of risk and return in your portfolio and you you decide how much return you want per unit of risk very similar to how we might look at like a Delta Theta ratio you know as an active Trader very similar idea okay so this is old modern portfolio the okay so John hit us on the next slide this is where it starts to get very very interesting if we add options to the MX to the mix we can kind of create for ourselves an option Frontier so we could so there's two things that we can do we're going to see the first one on this slide we're going to see the second one on the next slide when it comes to first and foremost reducing the risk of your portfolio I I know you guys are both going to agree with me sometimes on these Monday mornings you know we don't agree sometimes hit or miss it's Hit or Miss sometimes it's very it's more Miss than hit but yes it's it's certainly both yes correct I think we're all going to be in agreement I think we're all going to be on the same page this is something that I think it's overlooked so much in the derivative space when you add derivative exposure to your portfolio like short options for example it is so easy and simple to reduce the risk of your portfolio to reduce the overall portfolio risk that you're exposed to and I think this is something that a lot of people Miss would you guys agree with that as just a general statement yeah I mean you can't you can't not right I mean you guys just answered an email a couple days ago I was watching confirm and S I saw the email that came in and the guy had um I think he he had like a 12 or 15% return for the year but his risk was significantly less and he was trying to ask you guys if that was if that was a success or not and what did you guys say yeah for sure I mean it depends on how much risk you're taking but yeah for sure because when you think about what you know what are we trying to achieve as you know active Traders we're trying to achieve higher return and lower risk now sometimes we have to choose one over the other of course it's very difficult to find both at the same time but both are considered Victory like both are considered a w right and so I think that's an important thing to remember I we get so fixed dat on returns we get so fixed on making money and you rightfully so I mean that's why we're doing what we do but if you're able to achieve similar returns at much much less risk then that can be you know a victory in and of itself itself and even if you achieve less returns lower returns which I think is kind of what he was emailing about you know 15% relative to s Spy at 25 last year whatever like that is a that is an underperformance but if you factor in the lower volatility it may not be underperformance perance it may actually be better right Tom sure I yes answer for Tom yeah I mean sure I mean you say of course but I think a lot of people I think a lot of people skip over this step I think it's important for us to kind of slow some things down like let's control the mechanism here and let's make sure we understand you know that that taking that risk is a big is a big thing too I agree you're taking you're taking little liberties with patting yourself on the back here or at least talking about it not yourself you but yeah I agree I agree this what you're supposed to do I liked our answer better just so you know our answer was that benchmarks can be misleading because you're not competing against a benchmark you're competing against the amount of risk that you're taking but that's what he's quantifying it here with right I mean I understand a little bit yeah no I mean of of course I mean you are absolutely uh benchmarking against the number of of the amount of risk that you're taking but that and that's kind of what I'm trying to say here this morning at least on this slide I think so many people you know benchmarking to a major index I mean it makes some sense at least at you know a base level just kind of thinking in very simple terms but then you have you have to go the next step you have to quantify the amount of risk that you're taking the option Frontier minimum variance more full it's going to be even lower risk okay John here us on the next slide but what if we look at an even different scenario where now you have a portfolio where because of the added derivative exposure because of the added options you have the opportunity for not only lower risk but higher returns because now you have a more strategically Diversified portfolio because now you have other ways to make money that are not just tied to the directional exposure of the overall Market where you know on passively passively Long Market goes up everybody's happy Market goes down everybody's sad I mean it's very simple straightforward and I guess that's a benefit but it doesn't really give you a lot of strategic flexibility with the option Frontier right and with added derivatives to your to your portfolio it's just we we all know this we're kind of beating a dead horse but I just think when it comes to the connection to ecademic finance when it comes to the way that most traditional you know uh investors and money managers think you know even if they go as far as you know go go as deep into academic Finance into something like modern portfolio Theory you know they're going to run into some problems they're going to run into some some difficulties in kind of connecting that to the markets that we that we trade today and the and the Global Financial Marketplace as we have it in 2025 where we have things like options Futures options Futures Etc that really I mean this may all look like a bunch of like you know theoretical hand waving and whatever but it's actually very simple to get to that dash line today it really is just by adding you know short put exposure in place of long shares I mean you know short strangles to get neutralized exposure like things like that are going to allow you to minimize your uh risk while also possibly potentially increasing your returns and so this is how we update modern portfolio Theory gentlemen you think we did an okay job yeah I mean I think I think modern portfolio Theory needs needs to be updated I think it's time you can own it after 70 years because a moment ago you said it was fine people probably just weren't paying attention that's all no I I think modern portol theory is fine I just think it need we just what he mentioned to start this off with it needs to be updated so for few theories have contributed more to portfolio analysis than modern portfolio Theory as it allows investors to conceptualize the waiting between risky Assets in their portfolios but perhaps modern portfolio theory is due for an update as simply adding short premium to any Equity portfolio could reduce risk and increase return
