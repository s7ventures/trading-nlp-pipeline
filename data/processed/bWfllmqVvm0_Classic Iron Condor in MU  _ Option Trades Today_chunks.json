  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today right here from the Batcave right here from downtown Chicago it's October 17th 2024 but first as I always do let's take a quick look at the market even the S&P is up $10 you can see here that they've had a good range today down to 5871 up to 5927 let's just call them mid-range for the day bulls and bears both having opportunity to make money NASDAQ up 75 uh Russell which has been strong the last two weeks",
  "Russell which has been strong the last two weeks sorry last two days taking a breather uh today strong relative to the &ps of NASDAQ taking breather today down 18 leader to the clubhouse to the downside down uh just about three4 of a percentage Point Dow up 105 a public service announcement Dia uh has a dividend that's the Dow uh options if you're a dow uh Trader and you're in November staying mechanical uh let's just call the dividend around 50ish cents that would mean any call that's fairly",
  "cents that would mean any call that's fairly deep in the money let's say uh around the 374 and lower call I don't think anybody has those calls as you can see here the open interest is very small but anyway you would be in Jeopardy of a dividend now looking at November is one thing looking at October if you're one of those traders that like to trade the zero or one- day options in these smaller products than the SPX meaning the diamonds 5050 C dividend is going to put you in Jeopardy right now",
  "is going to put you in Jeopardy right now of around the 429 calls remember that dividend is 50 Cents that means the any option that has a put trading at around or under 50 cents is going to make the calls in Jeopardy of being exercised exercised so that the person on the other side of trade gets long stock collects the 50 c dividend all things being equal on my example here of $429 they can go in and the next day and buy these puts for under 50 cents they would lock in a 10-cent profit now",
  "50 cents they would lock in a 10-cent profit now that's a very small profit on a dividend play but again something for you to think about when it comes time when you have an spy dividend which is significantly greater somewhere around a150 or so then it makes it a lot more um scary for those who have short options or even just a call spread that might be deep in the money one side gets exercised and all of a sudden you come in you're short 100 shares of stock long your call you have no",
  "100 shares of stock long your call you have no additional risk but you owe that dividend in spy would be $150 and the Diamonds it would be 50 cents all right back to our regularly schedule program that's a little dividend risk play on there you know what I like to do what I always like to do is get rid of these earnings I like to look at a high IV Rank and get rid of these earnings but for now I'll just get rid of the of the earnings here for you I found a stock without going through all of",
  "you I found a stock without going through all of them a little bit we talked about on the show mu a good trading vehicle I've had decent success in there as you can see here um over the last five days this is the ivx 5-day change I'll put a little bit higher for you so you can read there um it's up almost 1 and a half% a little bit over 1 and a half% with an ivy rank of 41 and no earnings looming so for me that makes it well if it's got tight liquid markets and it's in the high option volume",
  "liquid markets and it's in the high option volume list I got to imagine there's players there then it makes it something that I want to look at it makes me interested in looking at it you can see it's already had a decent range today pretty much following the market about mid-range for the day trade up almost 114 down to 11 it's 112 and I'll just round and say a half let's take a look at mu November with 29 days we like to put on trades around 45 days that gets us to these weekly options you",
  "45 days that gets us to these weekly options you take a look at these weekly options and you'll see that they're 20 cents wide for the most part across the board here a little bit tighter on these out of the money options good not great volume uh in open interest when you compare it to let's just even go to December you go to December here's the open interest thousands on every line thousands on every line on the on the put side so for me it's a no-brainer even though there's 64 days to",
  "it's a no-brainer even though there's 64 days to December mber 45 being the closest which will bring us to these November options you don't want to trade these November options in my opinion you want to go with a liquidity is you want to go to these December 20 options with 64 days yeah actually have a higher implied volatility in December than you do in November 51.5% to 48 and change helping you a little bit more when sellling premium so what am I looking at doing here well I have no opinion",
  "am I looking at doing here well I have no opinion uh on mu maybe you do uh I I'm going to call it mid-range higher or mid-range for its most recent move um I know the chips and uh stocks are quite hot these days um here's a stock that's been as high as 150 and change and it's been as low as you know 85 and change what am I looking to do here well I'm going to look to do something that has a little bit less risk because I don't like what's going on with volatility for/ VX down 22 cents uh but",
  "on with volatility for/ VX down 22 cents uh but for/ VX uh volatility staying a little bit bid here and like I said these stocks have been on a little bit of a tear here so I'm going to do something with defined risk it also helps those players who talk about my podcast either write a comment down below which I love to to respond to I respond to every one of them that that I see um maybe use a strategy that has less buying power so that's what I'm going to do here so typically I might look to",
  "I'm going to do here so typically I might look to sell and again you look at the open interest here it's great you know what let's go to um let's change one of these open interest uh to volume and see if I could make a uh point for you here uh volume there you go almost missed it all right what am I looking at at doing here look at the volume here on these options plenty for today so quite liquid look at the markets here they're about 10 cents wide 5 to 10 cents wide depending on the on the",
  "wide 5 to 10 cents wide depending on the on the strike you're going at here so you got good volume good open interest tight markets High IV rank 41.5% expanding volatility over the last 5 days uh it's up almost 1% typically I might look to sell something in that 20ish Delta range like the 97 and a half put and around uh the 135 calls that might be a classic iron Condor I would like to sell a little bit more risk to the downside because we're just inside the expected move a little bit more um uh",
  "inside the expected move a little bit more um uh room to the upside because you're outside of expected expected move um that strategy we use around $1,100 in a margin account relatively low for the almost in buying power that you're getting probity profit 68% Theta is $10 a day almost 11 that's for the risk that you're taking and it's completely delta neutral less than one Delta obviously the max profits 592 so if I'm looking to put some Capital to work which a relatively small amount of",
  "to work which a relatively small amount of capital and I'm what I'm trying to show you here is on a stock like this where the where the where you're getting so much uh bang for your buck because it has a good monthly implied volatility for those who can afford uh the buying power maybe this is a play to go or those who can afford to um take on the risk of having an undefined risk trade might be something uh you want to do I'm going to go with the same amount of buying power well the risk is",
  "the same amount of buying power well the risk is going to be a lot less but I'll get to it in a moment I'm going to go to a $10 wide iron Condor typically when we're doing iron Condors just is a quick rule of thumb $100 stock $10 wide $200 stock $20 wide $300 stock $30 wide just from our research you'll notice here uh that it doesn't change my risk parameter the green line uh Too Much from the overall play it does bring my buying power down from 1100 to 700 I'll round here my Max profit is",
  "from 1100 to 700 I'll round here my Max profit is going to be whatever I sell it for I sold this for 38 which was the mid price at the time so I'm assuming that maybe you can get uh maybe 309 or or even 310 if you get an uptick or a lucky move in implied volatility uh why am I going to a Define risk trade well I want to use less buying power I doesn't change my risk profile that much but obviously it does change how much buying power I'm using and that strangle does look very juicy for those",
  "and that strangle does look very juicy for those who can afford uh to take on that extra risk now this is going to move move a lot slower uh even though it has two long Deltas notice what we did here when we took off These Wings for a quick second same strikes that I'm short you're basically delta neutral or let's just call it short one Delta when I buy These Wings $10 wide that can only show you one thing that shows you that this call skew if I'm getting long Delta by going equal distance $10",
  "getting long Delta by going equal distance $10 away from my purchase price when it was basically delta neutral or actually one short Del just another way of looking at you know what uh call skew or put skew might look like in the trades that you're CH taking how they can move your Delta around even though you know by the nature of the Beast you're taking a little bit less risk because you have defined risk how do I um mitigate my risk when this goes against me well when my Delta gets to plus or",
  "against me well when my Delta gets to plus or minus around 15 I'll move up just the short strike so let's assume that mu continues to go higher and my Delta is now short 15 Delta I might take this 97 put and move it up to 105 now obviously the stock is going to be closer to 125 or so when I do this I am using more buying power it changes the buying power to $1,200 from the $700 that I had but that's how I mitigate the trade Delta if it continues to go lower and my Delta gets to uh positive 15 I",
  "to go lower and my Delta gets to uh positive 15 I would probably move this call down uh to the 125 strike all things being equal I'm picking up 10 short Deltas I had 15 long Deltas again this is just an example I'm reducing my Delta by 50% that's what we mean when we say reducing our Delta by 15% I got filled at 308 you can always see these trades before you see the podcast by going to the follow page clicking on Bob the trader and there you'll see my mu trade when I made it usually around the",
  "see my mu trade when I made it usually around the same time because that's when I get off the show there's nothing magic about this here's where the stock was when I put it on here's where the stock is now here's what the IV rank was a little bit higher at 42 62% probability of success it hasn't changed I like to be around that 65 so a little bit lower credit received 308 I give you a little description here it's a delta neutral iron condor even though you learned from this podcast that it has",
  "though you learned from this podcast that it has about two long Deltas which I still consider to be delta neutral all right you know what I'm going to do now Now's the Time when I ask you to please transfer move bring your account to tasty trade the number one brokerage firm in the galaxy take advantage of the one two three four $5,000 that they'll give you for just moving your account to tasty trade from another brokerage firm or open up a new account get the same kind of sweet sweet cash read",
