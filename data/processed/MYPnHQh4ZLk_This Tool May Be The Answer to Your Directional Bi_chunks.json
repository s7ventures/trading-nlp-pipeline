  "here's some predefined intervals that you can choose from on the new back testing tab on tasty what I like about this is that there are different times throughout you know Market history where we've definitely had some some crazy events and it's hard for people to remember just because we have nothing else to do in our lives and we can't remember our own kids' birthdays but we can remember like the pandemic sell off I mean I'm not saying that's a good thing or whatever but at least there's is",
  "a good thing or whatever but at least there's is what it is it is what it is exactly so so so the software helps you remember certain things everything am yeah and the good news I heard is that we will be releasing this in the software in another week or so oh awesome so it's going to be right in the tasty trade platform that we're using on the software version yes right now it's on web based only and it will be released on the software version I think by early next week okay good we're excited",
  "think by early next week okay good we're excited about it yeah let's go to the next slide so choose your intervals here for example back test bullish strategy during a bare Market to stress to stress test your strategy um we won't go through the all the software right now but um how much have you actually experimented with the new back testing platform that we built so as a research team we exp I mean we we use it every time that's why we use like most of the research to just prove raid or",
  "like most of the research to just prove raid or prove like to taste what you're going to put on paper as old slides so on this uh these segments the the main purpose was to show how can you taste how can you before making any decision how like which kind of data can you rely on how do you know like you the whole purpose is stress testing yeah the back test but like how do you know which event to pull up like how do you know what how to actually stress test something so there is okay when you go",
  "test something so there is okay when you go to these intervals you will see bad days right yeah we have be be market and we have bull market right yeah so when you go to those Corners you can taste and see the difference those intervals will show you different kind of results which will show you how stresses how like different those results will be and it will show you um hey if you do this it will give you this kind of result into so you think it's best to back test a bullet strategy during a",
  "it's best to back test a bullet strategy during a Market stress usest because it's just you want the you want as much of a tradeoff as you can get exactly okay let's go next slide Beth so we did a study we looked at a bare Market on the interval chosen was the inflation induced bare Market from January to October of 2022 that was a pretty decent uh that was a pretty decent selloff I mean that was a pretty negative year pretty decent selloff um spy 45 days to expiration 30 Delta short putut 50",
  "spy 45 days to expiration 30 Delta short putut 50 Delta short putut and the 20 30 Delta short putut spread so what you're trying to do is you're trying to test out bullish strategies in a bare Market in a bare Market exactly okay stretch those uh bullish strategy in bare Market you did not manage early on these no no management okay can you manage early with this back testing softare exactly these software is so easy you can modify to any extent you want you can manage a you can manage a 50 uh",
  "you want you can manage a you can manage a 50 uh percent of profit you can manage everything you want beautiful let's go to the next slide okay so and this might be a little hard to read for people I have another version right in front of me but um uh hopefully you can hopefully it looks you can see it um take us through what you have here Gad um the results of the strategy in terrible market conditions yeah so sorry so when you go to these terrible uh be market conditions you see short 50",
  "terrible uh be market conditions you see short 50 short ports it you show negative if you go to pnl Total pnl yeah it's almost like 4500 negative if you go to 30 Port 23 negative yeah 2300 negative if you go to 20 3020 Delta uh short put trade and you put this 204 the protections you will see uh almost 100 negative uh to uh pnl this Trace how bad this Market was this is for the total year right total year yeah this is not for trade basis this is everything combined everything combined yeah if",
  "everything combined everything combined yeah if you combine everything this Market in this interval this what you got yeah okay I got it and if you go to the next average also a p per trade no go back Beth one second so the first one total yeah the first one's total the second one's average per trade trade the max drw Downs these are new new uh features we added on back testing which will show you um how that your marks your percentage marks draw Downs so what's interesting here is that if you",
  "Downs so what's interesting here is that if you sold this put spread long short the 30 Delta long the 20 Delta you lost $224 per trade but if you did it and and you sold the $3 put it's only4 $165 per trade it almost feels like you won even though you lost well you only lost 22% um of return you know your return on Capital was NE 22% when the other ones were minus almost 40 4 yeah that's pretty interesting that's my take away from that all right now let's go next page Beth so the bull market",
  "now let's go next page Beth so the bull market same exact thing right exactly and this is the post-pandemic Surge from it's basically may20 to yeah uh same thing so now we're going to look at the exact opposite opposite yeah let's go here Beth next slide okay if you go straight to the return on Capital you will see that data put it's over 100 return on Capital if you go to 30 data put it's 69 or 70 and if you go to Delta 30 and you put 20 for the protection it will be 136 uh percent return on",
  "protection it will be 136 uh percent return on Capital these on the side of the bull market when the market is good so what do you expect I mean based on this I can't believe S&P are up nine points now I know wow what a little turnaround hasda up 97 um not sure what just happened but interesting um what my my takeaway from this is if you sold the 30 Delta puts regardless of the market condition you did way better better in the bull market than you did bad in the in the bare Market the bare",
  "you did bad in the in the bare Market the bare Market exactly so the strategy is just sell 30 Delta puts and close your eyes forever and remember there's no management there's no Management in these strategies you just put there with the whole risk in included yeah I mean it's really interesting that you know how it it really the losses were a fraction of the gains MH exactly you know um in in both periods that's that's pretty damn interesting um and this one of the importance of this uh back",
  "um and this one of the importance of this uh back testing tool it will show you all as I said both angles I mean both Corners in bare Market what will you expect to get in your portfolio as return in bu Market what do you expect to get in in your portfolio as return capital got it okay let's go to the last slide Beth takeaways the back testing tool allows users to simulate and evaluate various trading strategies using historical data by identifying strategies that perform well in challenging",
  "strategies that perform well in challenging conditions Traders can build more resilient portfolios and using multiple Market scenarios including both typical and extreme conditions a comprehensive view of the strategies uh it gives you a comprehensive view of the strategy's potential Effectiveness and again like I said my main takea away from this was just that in the bare Market you lost money in the bull market you made money but you made three times as much money so wasn't that bad um that's",
  "times as much money so wasn't that bad um that's fun Gad that was a fun piece yeah thank you for coming in yeah also you have to add like it's free for any everyone who have a tasty TR account oh don't tell that to Tony because we're charging him making a lot of money off him okay"
