  "sharing today, I am looking at a potential trade idea for January 19th, 2024. The S&P is up 42 handles, NASDAQ up 106, Russell up, and the Dow up 283. Volatility is up by 25 cents. Let's dive into the market analysis.",
  "I will show you a trade I put on earlier today. The market has moved since then. I put the trade on at 10:20 this morning when SPY was just under 589. It is now almost a dollar higher. Consider waiting before making a trade.",
  "When considering a trade, I start by reviewing high option volume stocks with a low IV rank. I avoid stocks with upcoming earnings reports, as they can impact volatility. This helps me identify opportunities that may be influenced by market fluctuations.",
  "I want to sell puts in SPY due to high volatility levels. Put skew is present, with puts trading higher than calls at equal distances. Further out-of-the-money puts have more premium.",
  "The volatility has been increasing recently, so I am looking to play for a reversion in the market and a decrease in volatility. There are no earnings or dividends to worry about. I received positive feedback on the dividend hack I shared previously. I will repeat it for you.",
  "I will be looking at the January 29th options. The dividend is around $170. Calls under $520 will have dividend risk if the corresponding puts are trading under the dividend price.",
  "At a dividend price of $165, trading 520 puts and calls may be exercised. The 440s and 445s are likely to be exercised. Consider trading shorter day options like the D One Day Option to keep positions overnight.",
  "If the dividends are around $1.70, options on the call side at 585 and lower may be exercised. Look at the open interest on the 584 calls with the stock trading at its current level. Tomorrow, you may see this open interest increase significantly.",
  "If you have a position on a stock with a dividend higher than the put price, being short or long a call option with a strike price of 582 will likely be exercised. This applies to any stock and can impact your dividend earnings.",
  "I plan to do a 1 by 2 ratio spread with 582 calls expiring on January 29th for a quicker timeframe. I expect a rally in the market and believe this strategy will move quicker with shorter-dated options.",
  "I will buy one 550 put and sell two 540 puts for a $2 credit. The trade currently has a 95-96% probability of profit, positive theta of $1.225, and a long Delta of 7. The stock is rallying, but this trade is well outside the one standard deviation expected move. Pricing is favorable despite low volatility.",
  "Pricing with volatility in the teens can be advantageous for mildly bullish or omnidirectional trading. For example, at a strike price of 540, you can potentially make $10 on a trade involving 540 puts. This trade would require $6,700 in buying power. If this is too much for you, consider adjusting your options accordingly.",
  "Decide how much you want to risk. For example, changing buying power by $30 instead of $2 can increase potential profit to $1.70. Adjust buying power based on desired risk level.",
  "If the cost of the puts is too high for you, this may not be the right trade. Consider your buying power before making a decision.",
  "The market is currently at $182, up from $170. Volatility is high, with the market down a nickel. I would wait for some capitulation before considering a trade. Volatility has increased significantly.",
  "In SPY, it's up almost 10% over the last 5 days. The IV rank is up 46. My trade for the day is an omnidirectional slightly bullish 1 by 2 put ratio spread. Enjoy your Christmas and consider transferring your account to Tasty Trade to support us.",
