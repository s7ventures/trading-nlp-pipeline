  "welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptista and I have a trade idea for you today January 19th 2024 only a few more days left before Christmas and the new year let's see what's going on in the market &ps up 42 handles they've actually had a nice big range today you can see here they were over 6,000 at one point they were under 5940 to 5980 let's call them mid-range uh up 41 NASDAQ up 106 Russell uh up and the Dow up 283 volatility in by 25 cents unfortunately with my trade that I'm",
  "by 25 cents unfortunately with my trade that I'm going to show you here today um I'll make this short and sweet for you markets moved a little bit since I put this trade on you can see I put this trade on if you want to going to the follow page uh just a few moments ago of filming this you could see right here at 10:20 this morning uh when spy was 580 well just under 589 now it's a full dollar almost a dollar higher so the trade that I'm going to put on um it's moved so maybe you want to wait a",
  "put on um it's moved so maybe you want to wait a little bit what am I looking to do here well first um as I always do I like to go into my high option volume list I like to look at the ivy rank I like stocks that don't have earnings a lot of stocks are having earnings uh in January I looked at coin it has earnings in January looked at a few others they all have earnings in January so I wanted to go to something that's really going to be affected by volatility because I think volatility VX um is",
  "by volatility because I think volatility VX um is at its highs uh obviously you can see here over the last couple days at its highs yes it's been higher this year um but this is about the high end of its range and I want to look to sell puts because in spy there is put skew meaning that sk's trade of that puts trade higher than calls equal distance away and the further out of the money you get those puts really hold a lot more premium to them you can see here that the uh volatility is really",
  "you can see here that the uh volatility is really uptick the last couple of days I'm going to play for a little bit of reversion in maybe the market and maybe a little reversion uh in volatility meaning volatility go lower so what am I looking to do here no earnings to worry about um no dividend to worry about now I got a lot of great feedback by people talking about um the dividend uh little hack that I gave you I'm going to do it one more time for you I'm going to go to the January 29th",
  "time for you I'm going to go to the January 29th options uh just to give you uh a quick little look here on what it would be the dividend is around a 170ish maybe that's on the highend you can figure it out by doing the reversal conversion but let's just assume that it's a$ 170ish that means all these calls under 520 are going to have dividend risk why because the put all you have to do is look at the corresponding put those puts if they're trading under the dividend price like here they're",
  "under the dividend price like here they're trading at $165 that means it's a nickel to somebody to exercise those 520 puts maybe they 520 calls maybe they won't exercise them but they're certainly going to exercise the 440s the 445 maybe this is not compelling to you by trading the 29 day options but if you're trading the shorter day options like maybe the D One Day Option you're going to keep a position on overnight because it either goes for you or against you or you just want to have that",
  "you or against you or you just want to have that position on when you look at that same thing what options on the call side are going to be exercised if the dividends around $1.70 yeah those 585 and lower really maybe people won't do it for a for a dime but they'll do it for 20 30 40 cents look at the open interest on these 584 with the stock trading right here right now tomorrow you'll see this open interest uh in the teens or maybe a 100 so there's going to be a lot of these uh calls being",
  "there's going to be a lot of these uh calls being exercised if you have a position on even if it's a full winner you're going to cost yourself the dividend even if it's a full loser you're going to cost yourself more of that dividend so quick little hack any stock this works with any stock whatever the dividend is if you're short a call let's call it the 582 or even long a call 582 and the dividend is over the put price in this example uh $1.70 these 582 calls will definitely be exercised all",
  "these 582 calls will definitely be exercised all right what am I looking to do uh I'm looking to do a 1 by two ratio spread uh 29 day options January 29th um why not February because I just want a quicker time frame on this I think uh I don't want to be in this for the next uh month or and a half I want to be in this for the next week or two expecting a little bit of a rally in the market and this will move quicker with a rally in the market if I'm shorter dated what am I going to look to do",
  "I'm shorter dated what am I going to look to do here I'm going to buy the 550 puts one time I'm going to sell two two of the 540 puts I'm going to do this and I did do this for $2 $2 credit I know it's traing for around a $1.75 or $177 right now obviously the stock is rallying um this trade has a 95 96% pop a PO positive data decay of $1 1225 uh a long Delta of seven well outside a one standard deviation expected move you normally don't get these kind of pricing uh with volatility in the teens",
  "kind of pricing uh with volatility in the teens like it was earlier 15 16 17 but when you get in the 20s you can take it a little bit of Advantage if you're mildly bullish or omnidirectional because remember at 540 you can make $10 on this trade because those 540 puts would be worth nothing those 550 puts which along would be worth $10 it does use $6,700 in buying power so if that's too much buying power for you well listen you can go to any option you want and decide how much you want to kind",
  "you want and decide how much you want to kind of waste because really that's what you're doing here I'll just go to these uh 75s I change my uh my my my credit in this example by 30 I had $2 up there it's trading closer to $150 now but if I change if I did this at $2 I'd be only able to make $1.70 but I changed my buying power by enough no not enough cuz look it's $6,800 so you got to move this to what you think your buying power would like to be um reduced by and you're going to have to go",
  "be um reduced by and you're going to have to go closer and closer and closer until you can get it to be reduced by something that's under your number here you go now you're down to $3,000 would it be worth it to buy these puts at a125 probably not so for me you either have to have the $6,000 in buying power to put on this trade or $6,800 in buying power to put on this trade if that's too big of a trade for you then this is not the trade for and you will see look at how this moves around it was",
  "you will see look at how this moves around it was just $170 $1.75 now it's a182 Market doesn't look that great here today uh with the way it's sold off and volatility um kind of staying bid only down nickel right now so I don't know if I was going to put on this trade I would probably wait until we see a little bit of capitulation maybe see the NASDAQ G PS uh turn into the red anyway that's my trade for today oh I forgot to show you volatility has been up pretty nicely or I think maybe I did in",
  "been up pretty nicely or I think maybe I did in spy it's up almost 10% over the last 5 days and the ivx or the IV uh ivx is up almost 10% the IV rank is up 46 so that's my trade for the day omnidirectional slightly bullish 1 by two put ratio spread you have a Merry Christmas enjoy yourselves out there but you know what no better time than when you're off from work to move transfer bring your account to tasty trade help us keep the lights on here and more importantly help us keep tasty live",
