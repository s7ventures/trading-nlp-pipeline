  "we did a piece the other day talking about skew and one of the things that we learned is that the higher the skew the more prepared people are for a big down move and we always thought that skew was more of a red flag suggesting that you're probably going to get a pretty big outlier move coming soon and what we learned is that it's actually that's probably not the best way to describe skew the best way to describe skew is that um it's really a measure of how many people are buying protection",
  "measure of how many people are buying protection that's why the out of- the money options are bit up so high and right now um me just get you the latest quote skew closed 16278 I don't think skew updates intraday if I'm I don't think it goes tick for tick right doesn't it just I don't believe so I believe you're correct I think it's like once a day or something but 162 78 it's a it's a CBOE proprietary U measure of out of the money put and call buying um it's very high right now so we wanted to",
  "um it's very high right now so we wanted to take a look and see when markets have big outlier moves where's the skew trade now based on what we used to think we thought okay probably means the skew is pretty high but based on our research from Wednesday the AR we're going to make the argument that it might not mean that it might mean Skuse actually a little bit lower you ready for this I am let's do it let's do it so while in the black shs model log returns are normally distributed in reality",
  "log returns are normally distributed in reality the distribution is non-normal with a heavier downside tail for which means negative skewness so the skew is an index published by the sibo which follows similar methodology to the vix but with a higher waiting for out of the- money option prices so a high skew means that the market is pricing in a larger probability for large downside moves which is what we have right now but have large skew values been able to anticipate outlier events yes or no",
  "been able to anticipate outlier events yes or no bat not a trick question yeah I I mean a high skew I'm I'm gonna I'm GNA say we have more when when skew is low obviously that would be my my way of answering this okay that's Fair um let's go to the next slide Beth hang on one sec let's go next slide perfect so using the SPX the vix and skew we did we looked at closing dates from 2011 to present so 13 years worth of data we looked at when the SPX had outlier down moves based on the vix dve",
  "SPX had outlier down moves based on the vix dve expected move at the 30-day and the 7-Day and the overnight moves okay so 13 years of 30-day 7-Day and overnight moves for big outliers to the downside and we examine the skew value immediately preceding these outlier moves as a baseline over the life of the skew its mean and median values were 130 and 128 respectively significantly lower than the 162 right now now again I need to preface this by saying there's not a crazy number of cases to look",
  "there's not a crazy number of cases to look at I mean there there's enough to do this study but it's not like we had an abundance of cases so although it's statistically significant the one thing that when I was talking to Jacob about this last night the one thing he mentioned to me was he goes Tom yeah but this is on this is every you know there's not a million times when we had these huge down moves so it's hard to you know create enough occurrences but the mean value and the median values",
  "but the mean value and the median values were 130 and 128 we're currently at 162 does that mean we can't have a down move now of course not it just means we're more likely to have a big down move if the skew was a lot lower let's take a look well doesn't it didn't make sense to a week ago no it didn't I I would have said skew is high I I would have said here is how I always answered I would have always said that if skew is high the at the money options are are are high but the out of the money",
  "options are are are high but the out of the money options in relationship to the two are a lot higher meaning that they're buying protection now if you look at that the other side of the coin of that would be that a lot of people are buying protection which would then if you look on the other side of that mean that you know when we expect it to happen ain't going to happen and that's the point that I think Jacob brought up which is pretty cool let's take a look at some of the research here so",
  "let's take a look at some of the research here so in the 30-day outlier moves and and this is two times the expected move okay um two and a half times the expected move and three times the expected move we had to we had to come up with like research that shows a bigger than normal move right we're looking for outliers so two times two and a half times and three times the expected move which only happens theoretically let's say 2% of the time for two times and the actual frequency is one one and",
  "two times and the actual frequency is one one and a half% so when we look at this the numbers here suggest that the skew in those cases is always around 130ish okay the mean the mean skew proceeding the median skew proceeding is you know 128 130 132 for two times two and a half times and three times you expect the move those are all close enough to say you know 130 is your number and that's two to three times the expected move that's on a 30-day outlier move the projection so let's go to the",
  "outlier move the projection so let's go to the next one and look at um I think we did seven days yeah and then we did one day on the 7-Day expected move the chances of a 2% two times the expected move you know 2% 3 times .13 and when you look at the actual you know the number the one thing that jumps off this screen at me was that three times the expected move the actual is three times what it is in the theoretical where everything else is actually a little bit lower but the me the skew",
  "actually a little bit lower but the me the skew proceeding is 128 so there's no cases yet where a 162 skew led to kind of a crash type thing it's always the 130 or anything above that 130ish average right right but the the third line here where it says three times expected move do you see where it says 0.13 theoretical and the actual is 4.4 that's the only thing that jumps out to me on this screen that's other than skew is that if you're looking for a big outlier move you're you're more likely",
  "for a big outlier move you're you're more likely to get it at like three times than you are at two times you know two times is usually less than theoretical three times it's greater than theoretical let's go to the one day and see if that Trend continues next slide Beth the one day so in the one day yeah it's the same it's the same kind of thing the skew the skew actually drops even more we went from 130 on the 30-day to 128 on the 7 day to 127 or 126 on the one day so all of these SKS are",
  "127 or 126 on the one day so all of these SKS are significantly lower than where we are now before you see a huge down move the realized um frequenc these down moves is always going to be less than the theoretical except when you get to the three times the expected move I mean it's a very interesting study from the standpoint of you know one learning that the the greater than expected moves happen with less frequency until you get to the real outliers which are like three times the expected",
  "outliers which are like three times the expected move those are how play how can get play for something that happens less than 1% of you can't you can't that's the whole point you can't but it happens more than it should theoretically that's all they're saying but all of these have a low skew so we're nowhere we're kind of not in that range right now um let's that's why the market was able to come back you mean the S&P are up 21 let's go to the next slide so we'll look at some of the takeaways",
  "next slide so we'll look at some of the takeaways here because this is um I think we covered them but let's just let's just make sure so the vix and normal distribution statistics did a good job of anticipating 2X and 3X expected moves but severely underestimated the frequency of three times skew values that preceded outlier downside SPX moves appeared very typical slightly lower than usual when looking at short-term outlier moves and while the skew represents how prepared Market participants",
  "skew represents how prepared Market participants are for outlier down moves even at its most extreme they remain unlikely um and realized outliers frequently come when they are least expected I think that's the main takeaway when the skew is lower that's when you get your outlier moves and the really bad outlier moves happen more often than they should the're really bad ones every all the other ones happen less than they should"
