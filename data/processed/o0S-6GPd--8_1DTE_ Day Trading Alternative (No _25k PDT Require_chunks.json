  "To avoid pattern day trading rules with less than $25,000, you can have more than $25,000 in your account, trade futures or futures options, or trade with one day to go. Alternatively, you can trade ES options or MEES options, which have no pattern day trading rules.",
  "study, it has been found that selling zero DT options at market open can be very profitable. However, this strategy may conflict with pattern day trading rules, which typically allow only three round turns. Some brokers have no pattern day trading rules, such as regulatory body B, once you have over $25,000 in your account.",
  "In trading, three round turns are allowed in one week, which can run out quickly. If we sell a position the night before and cover it at the next opening, instead of doing a round trip in the same day, we may end up losing due to the magnitude of opening moves. This applies to SPX options as well.",
  "Tony predicts a small loss in the opening moves. He doesn't expect to make or lose much money based on past experience. The study suggests a high win ratio when selling options on the close and buying them back the next day.",
  "We will buy back the positions the next morning and analyze the P&L. Trading will occur from Monday to Friday, excluding Friday to Monday. All trades will be assumed to exercise at the mid price. Buying power control for long strikes is at your discretion.",
  "Buy 40, 30, and 20 Delta strangles the night before and sell them the next morning. Straddles had a 68% win rate, 40 Delta strangles 67%, 30 Delta strangles 69%, and 20 Delta strangles 71%.",
  "the net PNL for the overnight trade was influenced by the size of the position. Straddles and 40 Delta strangles made about double of what 30 Delta and 20 Delta strangles made, with similar levels of risk. The study suggests that selling larger positions, such as straddles or strangles, may result in higher profits.",
  "Sell a straddle or big strangle for the best results. Avoid selling cheap options. Selling zero DT premium has been successful over the past two years if winners are managed aggressively. Pattern day trading rules may impact trading strategies.",
  "PDD pattern day trading rules make it difficult to manage zero DTE trades with less than $25,000. Selling 1dt options on the previous close and managing them the next morning can help avoid PDD restrictions. Holding short positions overnight was profitable overall, but occasional large losses occurred due to dramatic overnight price movements.",
  "The rules meant to protect retail investors may inadvertently increase risk for those trading zero DT trades due to overnight risk. It is disingenuous and hopefully will be changed. Stay small and give it a shot for better results. Good job by the team.",
  "We expect better results tonight. Good job. We'll take a quick break and be back with more live trading. Stay tuned for Scott Sheridan and Tasty Trade World Headquarters."
