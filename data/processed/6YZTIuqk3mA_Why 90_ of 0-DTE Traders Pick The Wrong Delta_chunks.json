  "Zero DTE options in the right underlying are fast, liquid, and accessible to retail traders. They offer instant gains or losses due to the extreme speed of the market. Traders may feel like they missed opportunities due to the fast pace. It is worth analyzing how short premium trades placed later in the day have performed and considering preferred strikes at certain times.",
  "Examining selling zero day strangles using 20, 30, 40, and 50 Delta strikes at market open times of 10 a.m., noon, or 1:30 p.m. in SPX with 20 months of data collected every 10 minutes.",
  "trades were managed if they reached 25% of max profit, losers that didn't reach 25% were allowed to expire. SPX cash settled. All trades assumed to exercise at Mid price. Cost of buying power for long strikes was neglected. Subtract $10 to $15 from daily P&L for more realistic results.",
  "When analyzing daily P&L, consider the impact of spreads widening at the close. Backtests may be affected by this issue, so discounting $1 to $15 can help adjust for it. Focus on open straddles with a 40 Delta and strangles with a 30 Delta.",
  "At the open, straddles at 40 Delta, 30 Delta, and 20 Delta strangles provide win percentage, win rate, average P&L, and SAR. Strangles at 10 a.m. were not as common due to high buying power usage for wide wings.",
  "At 10 a.m., the win percentages for trades above average PNLs show that 40 Delta strangles have the highest P&L and highest sear. Straddles are similar but the 40 Delta strangle shows increased profit potential compared to the open.",
  "The open provides back and forth price action and potential changes in volatility, leading to better prices and tighter spreads. I will challenge the team to analyze this further when Tom is away on his trips.",
  "20ish Delta option or the 15ish Delta option for around $2 on either side. Zero day trading is all about direction, so consider both bullish and bearish scenarios.",
  "The market has been lacking directional movement over the past 20 months. Short premium strategies have been effective. Consider 40 Delta strangles at noon.",
  "The 40 Delta strangles are showing the highest average P&L, but also come with the highest risk. This tradeoff is common in any trading strategy. Higher premium positions, such as those with higher Delta options, offer greater potential wins but also carry more risk. The numbers reflect this tradeoff consistently.",
  "The board has been performing well, especially looking at the average P&L. The most interesting slide is the one showing activity around 1:30 PM, which is when trading starts to pick up. The first and last hours of the trading day are typically the most liquid.",
  "Market dynamics such as rebalancing of funds and liquidating positions at the close can lead to increased liquidity. At the money straddles may not be profitable in these situations.",
  "The increased volatility in the last hour of trading is causing higher risk for larger options with a 40 Delta and straddles, while the average risk remains consistent. The 20 Delta options are also affected.",
  "20 Delta strangle was not the right place to be. I am closer to the 30 Delta now, which may result in a higher probability of profit. I learned that trading straddles can be challenging.",
  "risk perspective, the timing of a trade doesn't significantly impact the overall risk. Whether you trade at the open, wait 10 minutes, wait an hour, wait until noon, or trade 10 minutes before the close, the risk remains relatively consistent. The key factor is understanding and managing the inherent risk involved in trading.",
  "has been a good time for selling zero day premium using consistent initial Deltas. Adjusting strikes for implied volatility and remaining time into expiration gave similar results as long as there were still a few hours left in the trade.",
  "With a few hours left in the trade, it's important to note that strikes are moving closer to at the money. This is significant for options with 40 Deltas, as they are right at the money. By focusing on initial deltas and using percentage profit targets, strike selection can be adjusted accordingly.",
  "We can adjust our trading profit targets seamlessly regardless of when we place trades or the volatility environment. It has been a good trade over the last 20 months. Many people on Twitter are trading iron condors, strangles, and straddles."
