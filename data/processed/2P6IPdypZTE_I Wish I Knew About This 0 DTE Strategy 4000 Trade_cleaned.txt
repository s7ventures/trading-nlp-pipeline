wide wings for the zero DT iron Condors let's take a look and see where Jacob and the team is going with this one because the size of the SPX and the time um and the fact that time is not factored into the F minimums which again that's really interesting because you know that benefits customers it does not benefit broker firms just to be clear we do not like the fact that um on SPX that there's no we don't get the benefit of duration so it's kind of a um a little bit weird but naked Z DT short positions are untradeable for most accounts the reason for that is a on lot shorts triangle is like 120 Grand where the index is currently trading so in order to reduce the 120 Grand down to some very reasonable number like 3 four 5 6 7 8 Grand whatever it is you got to buy the wings so last week We examined how using lowc cost part of the money long options lets you play Zero DT trades If instead we began the day knowing roughly how much buying power willing to commit how much would we end up spending on wings here's the question before I show you the study B if I told you that the cut off for a synthetic strangle versus an iron Condor if I tell how many points do you think that's going to be in the SPX I mean we've done a lot of research know how many points you think 30 20 you would think 30 I would say 30 sure you would think 30 yeah but after today's research we're going to show you it's really around 50 okay it's really around 50 points so anything inside of 50 points so if you're doing spy it's inside of five if you're doing Q's it's inside of Five Points if you're doing iwm it's inside of Five Points if you're doing SPX it's 50 so 50 and under is like an iron Condor and over 50 60 to 90 is like a synthetic strangle sure okay that's what we're going to show you today let's go next Slide the put side's going to have you're going to be shorter on the call side or tighter on the call side than the put side no this is just going the equidistant I I know but but an equal call is going to be much cheaper than that equal distance you're gonna get more money for the puts um let's go next slide remember in zero days it's not quite the same but so two years of data 20 30 40 Delta strangles um a variety of fixed these are fixed not Delta these are fixed strikes 30 to 100 wide examine the total cost of the Wings and just assume that um that if we're up 25% we're closing if not we're letting go okay let's go next slide oh actually this is not profits it's just buying power take that back so we go we like the 20 Delta short strike that's kind of our that's our wheelhouse that's where this first study looks at so if you do $40 wings cost you a buck you do $50 wings cost you 67 you want to go wider than that goes all the way down to 24 cents these are on the Zero days okay the average buying power though flips the other way 3,400 to 8,300 right you get that so the wider The Wider the wings um the cheaper the amount of money you have to put up but to buy the wings but the more money you have to put up to make the trade how often does it offer real protection I mean generally speaking we're talking it's nil yeah if you look if you look at this you're getting the same $650 no matter whether you go to $40 wide or $90 wide yeah and right I mean because that's the average average daily buying power is about $6 $650 different than the you just take the middle strike 60 bucks wide just for just for argument sake y it it protects you two 2/10 of 2/10 of 1% two basis points that's it and um no 20 Bas I'm sorry 20 basis points but the average buying power 5300 and the average cost 50 cents that's just that's the middle middle tier none of these are better than the other ones like if you do the most expensive or you do the cheapest it doesn't mean anything it's just it's all preference like we're not saying that any one of these is better than anything else we're just showing you the numbers if you only have $3,400 hours to use you got to buy the $40 wings or $30 Wings cuz then you know put up way less money if you have plenty extra Capital if 10 grand extra or n grand extra buy the $90 wings and only put up 24 cents mhm it's never going to help you anyway right so that's the whole point never never 2/10 2/10 you know one one time out of 100 it it's not really for protection it's really just to um to see how much money how much less money you have to put up so if you don't buy the wings it's 120,000 if you buy the wings it's 3,400 to 8,000 it's all thing that's your whole trade let's go next slide if you do the 30 Delta strike just to show you the numbers are all the same I mean you're going to pay more that's the whole difference for the wings you're going to pay a little a bit more and and you're going to put up a little less money and it might help you a little bit more the only time it really helps is if you're going to get to the next one Beth go to the next slide because these are all these numbers are all the same here's where 133% of the time it could come into play but you pay a lot more here when you're doing the 40 Delta strangle now here's the problem with the 40 Delta strangle I don't do it Tony doesn't do it we don't even really do 30 Deltas we really only do 20s but some people like the bigger numbers sure and the bigger premium and you put up less money here 2500 bucks but we just want to show you this is you pick your number like so next time somebody tells you oh you should only do $30 wide $40 wide $50 Wide Wings the answer here is it doesn't matter what you do do $90 if you want to put up more money do $40 if you want to put up less money like they're all theoretically none is better than the other it's just it's a symetrical it's just a symmetrical layout yeah I mean yeah I mean it comes down to risk versus reward and really more importantly than that you need the stock to cooperate you need the strategy to work because the stock cooperates and I've always said that since the dawn of time you always need the stock to cooperate no matter what the strategy is that you're applying and here's what they're saying here too zero days you know you really are looking to make a synthetic short option here it really comes down to account size now when you look at this yep that's really what it comes down to let's go next slide so we go through the takeaways here this is kind of interesting and again not a really complicated segment today but just showing you that pick whatever strike you want don't get too tight because you're not really doing yourself any benefit paying the extra money although naked zero DT premium is buying power reduction prohibitive we can use wide iron Condors to help us Place trades that behave like strangles 809 $80 or $90 wi is essentially strangle Behavior but you give up 30 cents per trade narrower than 50 can be viewed in Earnest as an iron Condor and the wings are much more about protection from large Moves In general for the same buying power commitment you'll spend less on the wings when your short strikes are further out of money and so in practice the conclusion here is you can adjust Wing selection every day balancing how much pine power you're willing to commit plays a role in how much p&l you're willing to sacrifice I like it nice nice nice study really telling you uh it's a game is it really place your bets I mean is it really it's just a game you know like you want to take you you want to put up less Capital you sacrifice a little p&l you want to put up more Capital you make more money it's the same game we always play
