  "is there any evidence that a volatile January leads to a volatile year I don't think so but I mean if you have a any volatile month is going to kind of skew a little bit of volatility for some time so for me I think if you have a volatile January you will have a volatile quarter at the very least I mean it's possible that if you have a volatile month in January you're going to have like Tony said a volatile quarter maybe but there's absolutely no evidence or statistical proof whatsoever that",
