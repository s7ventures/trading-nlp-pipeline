  "a volatile January will necessarily lead to a volatile year. However, a volatile month can impact volatility for some time. If January is volatile, it is likely to result in a volatile quarter at least. There is no concrete evidence or statistical proof to support this theory.",
  "There is no evidence to suggest that a volatile January predicts a volatile year."
