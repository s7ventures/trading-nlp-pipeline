profit targets by Delta zero DT options this is in our zero DT series uh but given the speed the number of zero DT trades maintaining high probability mechanics can be the key for Success we asked the research team to say how do you select the right profit Target for zero DTS because that's the big question we get how do you select the right profit Target 18 months worth of data um we looked at everything from 50 Delta strangles I'm sorry 50 Delta straddles sell both the far out of the money 10 Delta strikes this this study has a gazillion pages of research you can't go through it all but you're going to um we'll get to a spot which is really interesting we considered um hypothetical traders who would leave losing positions alone and close winners until using profit targets from 10 to 45% of the credit all trades were assumed to exercise or close at the mid price go to the next side Beth so the mid price is a little bit you know it's probably fair so you got to give up like a nickel or a dime so we wrote on here subtract $1 to $15 from the daily p&l values to account for buying power controlling the long strikes to get realistic results depending on how much Capital you commit to your zero DT positions so basically what they're saying is if you have to buy the wings for Capital reasons subtract $10 to $15 a day anyway we looked at the most do right I mean we looked at the worst 5% of all outcomes we looked at the average time of the day central time to close the trade and we looked at the percent of profitable trades all right let's do it let's do it Beth got a lot of stuff here there's like 10 slides so I'm not going to go through everything in detail but the first one we're going to look at is straddles now straddles the reason that's selling the put and call at the money now here's what's important to knowe and this is really easy for anybody to see the average time to exit we got really granular on this thing the average time to exit if you sold them on the opening is 10:06 in the morning you can't ask for more a more more context than this 90% win rate you make 60 bucks and you average at 10 you have average getting out by 10:06 and 87% for the 15% profit Target $116 getting out at 1037 and the last one was at 84% $117 getting out at 1108 after 1108 everything starts to go downhill so the whole answer here is you've got anywhere from an hour to 2 and 1 half hours that's it if you're selling straddles that's it that's all you got you got an hour to two and a half hours and you're on your own you're Flying Blind kind of thing that's the best we can do for you let's go to the next one we're going to go to strangles and we start with strangles and you can see the same kind of thing this is how granular we got 93 93% success rate closing at 9:51 in the morning an hour and a half after the opening at the 20% profit Target with an 89% and the best p&l was at um 1040 so 2 hours after the opening the the the takeaway here is that you've got between an hour hour and a half and two hours that's it life's over for the zero DTE you want the high probability success you know and we put the actual times down here everything starts to fall apart later on in the day let's go next we always talked about how you know if these trades work they work early you should look to get out of them earlier too as you can see here when you go start going down to like the 30 Del strangles the time to exit starts getting earlier so this is 946 you know down from 10:08 to to 1056 to 9946 and all the other times get earlier now could you stay a little bit longer make a little bit more money sure but the bottom line here is we're getting out early we're not holding anything the negative numbers are at the 35 45% 50% profit targets a lot harder a lot harder to do it's easy to say this right I mean when you looking at a loss early in the day and you know that you know you're kind of behind the eightball at this point you're like all right what do I do I know what I'm supposed to do very hard to pull the trigger at 25 Delta strangles the 10% profit Target it didn't really work out that well but the other one runes all were okay but you have to get out early again first hour and a half and we're going to go down to the 20 Delta strangles this is kind of the area we live in these are these are tough and but you're still to make money you're holding till about 10:30 so what are we learning from these slides we're learning kind of the 2hour window this is our window it's a two-hour window yeah now I like doing it when the vix one day is really high cuz I think that gives you a lot more Edge Let's go to the next one and this is the 15 Delta strangles and you can kind of see the same thing here there's not much money to be made you got kind of wait a about two hours um and the win rate's really high but the losses you know chew up into those profits and so you know the win rate's High the win rates in the 90s so you guys got the kind of the picture here the close to the money positions perform best when closed if the short options reach 20% of Max profit with short strikes 35 Delta to 20 Delta 25 to 30% profit targets are better performance in general the closer to the at the moneyy was more important to be willing to get out rapidly well performing mechanics tended to exit winning positions between 10 and 11:00 a.m. Central Time the riskier strikes benefited from safer management while higher pop short strikes were better off being allowed to run slightly longer to collect a larger portion of a smaller credit the bottom line here is you got two hours and depending on the strikes that you select you should set your expectations around that you're going to make less money selling further out of the money options but you're going to take less risk to
