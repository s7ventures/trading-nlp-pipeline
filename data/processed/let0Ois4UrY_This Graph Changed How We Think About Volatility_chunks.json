  "that means it's not that hard but there are some nuanced there are some nuances of knowhow in this case we're calling this the nuances of volatility a distributional perspective I'm not exactly sure where the team's going with this one me either let's take a look the nuances of volatility a dis that's an interesting word a distributional perspective okay I like it Market volatility the vix is a mean reverting asset whose average over the last years including to 2020 is 18.9 I would have guessed",
  "including to 2020 is 18.9 I would have guessed it would have been lower than that if you guess if you ask me over the last eight years which takes us back to 2017 I would have guessed that I would have guessed 18.9 is a little high I would have said closer to 17 but when we say that the vix is mean reverting it's because it's a math equation and it's stocks Futures which are price-based are not mean reverting because price is not mean reverting but when you have some form of an equation like",
  "but when you have some form of an equation like like volatility volatility is meting it gets too high it goes down it gets too low it goes up eventually it's very expensive to hold it knowing that it's mean reverting it's very expensive to hold it until that happens in fact in fact I would say it's next to Impossible um but at some point it will go back let's go next slide looking at an average Al loone can mislead your expectations of how often volatility is at certain levels in other words to",
  "volatility is at certain levels in other words to get a better picture of how volatility behaves we need to look at its distribution a distribution will show you that not only the average value but also the probabilities around all values that volatility can end up with what's interesting about this is our old research and this may updating our old research our old research used to show that volatility on a distribution basis would go up about 10% of the time go down about 20% of the time and",
  "10% of the time go down about 20% of the time and stay in a low State about 70% of the time let's see how this latest piece of research lines up with that so the distribution of all the daily vix value since 2017 is shown below notice the very long right skewed Tail Of course that gives you a good little picture but let's keep going yeah sure because of this large right tail that covers many large values with low probability the average of 18.7 does not split the values of the distribution",
  "does not split the values of the distribution evenly in fact it is roughly one and a half times as likely for the vix to be below average on any given day 60% of the time then above the average 40% of the time that's why you can see that yellow line kind of all the way to the left on this graph which okay this starts to bring that whole all that you know lull State into you know into perspective a little bit more let's go to the next slide that's a really good picture there the median the 50th",
  "a really good picture there the median the 50th percentile the vixs is 16.4 that makes more sense to me the median by definition tells us the value where the distributions occurrences are split equally so it is much lower in other words half the time the vix is above 16.4 and half the time it's below 16.4 all this again this is the distributional uh perspective of volatility it is very nuanced let's go to next Slide the chances of falling into the tale of the distribution this case um defined",
  "the tale of the distribution this case um defined by the vix value great G than 30 is just under 7% rarely do we get a vix over 30 is what that means sure I would have said the number was closer to five or 2% something like that you know two or three distribution curve I think over 35 it's going to be closer to two or 3% but 30% seven 93% of those are below that with the current vix at 16.1 as it close on Friday February 7th we look into the distribution graph from 2024 and you can see it's not",
  "graph from 2024 and you can see it's not that dramatically different from the other things that we were just talking about so some of the takeaways here when looking at an asset like volatility with non normally distributed prices it's important to consider values besides just the average the average tells you the typical value to Expect When taking into account the magnitude of each value whereas the median tells us the typical value Val to Expect When taking into account only the number of",
  "When taking into account only the number of occurrences literally the middle value with normally distributed data sets no skew the median and the average are the same in this case a little bit different but um oh no the median average has be the same yes no about yeah right yep but yeah I mean that's how you get down to that 16 level that's actually really good that just shows you that you know there there there's a pretty low chance the vix over 30 you know over time but and 's a high chance",
  "30 you know over time but and 's a high chance of it trading below that 16 level"
