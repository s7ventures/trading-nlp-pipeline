should I be taking profits On Any Given trade at 32% within 6 days of placing a 45-day expiration trade should I let it right out to the Target of 50% of Max profit I don't know if I'm leaving too much on the table by taking the earlier profits if I sold something at $10 and I was up $320 I'm sure that I would take it if I'm making 32% I'm getting the hell out running like a thief in the night the default is always earlier the default is always take your profits we always default to earlier rather than later
