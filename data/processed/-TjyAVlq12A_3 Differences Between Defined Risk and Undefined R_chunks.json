  "When deciding between a defined risk strategy and an undefined risk strategy, consider factors such as your preference for the underlying asset, market conditions, and capital efficiency. Use undefined risk when you are not comfortable with the underlying asset or if the markets are too wide. Use defined risk when you want to limit your potential losses and prevent the counterparty from spreading off the trade. Avoid tying up capital in ineffective trades, such as naked options on low-priced stocks.",
