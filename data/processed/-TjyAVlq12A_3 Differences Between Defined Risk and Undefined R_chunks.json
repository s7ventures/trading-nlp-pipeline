  "when do you use a defined risk strategy versus an undefined risk strategy sometimes I'll use undefined risk when I don't really like trading a certain underlying that's number one or I think the markets are too wide that's number two because if you use Define risk then it's easier for the counterparty to spread it off and then number three is if I feel like it's a very ineffective use of capital like I'm not going to want to tie up naked options on A1 th000 stock for example that I really don't",
  "on A1 th000 stock for example that I really don't care about I'd rather do that to fine risk so it has do with capital efficiency it has to do with liquidity and it has to do with whether or not you even want that position sometimes we'll just do something to find risk cuz we don't really care"
