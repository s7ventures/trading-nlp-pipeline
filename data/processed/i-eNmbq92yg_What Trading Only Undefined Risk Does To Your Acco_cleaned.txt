navigating Capital allocation and buying power reduction let's take a look and see where the boys are going with this so the past two Mondays actually you know yeah it's it's it seems like you know August 5th was a Monday and then you know the Deep seek was a Monday and this past Monday was down 100 you know it's crazy the past two Mondays they've seen significant uh rise in the vix after major weekend news this has caused some Traders some overall portfolio buying power buying power reduction to balloon causing them to allocate more Capital than than they initially started with let's take a look and see how that happens because we should point this out if you have Futures positions on the volatility can adjust based on time and based on I mean the the the capital can adjust based on time and based on volatility and Futures and Futures options but in listed options the requirements are static so if the requirements are static then why would it require more money and the answer is just because of the draw down in p&l you know it just it just sucks up the available cash this is due to BPR expansion Define risk strategies usually don't change buying power reduction during the trade as the max loss is already defined at order entry however undefined risk strategies have the possibility for buying power reduction to greatly change throughout the trade this is why different account sizes are only able able to trade undefined risk with certain stocks as we show in the next slide let's go to let's go so here's something that we kind of put out here just to help people a little bit which is underlying asset selection for diverse account sizes so 10,000 100,000 a million dollars just showing like you know what you could potentially um different stocks that you could look at based on account size that might fit into those um to those those percentage breakdowns that I gave before you know like between you know 1 and 3% a half a percent and 2% defined risk between three and five or 3 and 7% undefined risk you know obviously one of the advantages larger accounts have is you can do more stuff I I want to be really clear about this the reason though Rich it's very rare because of one big down move for us to change the requirements on an individual stock like requirements we have for um for SLV or the requirements we have you know for apple or the requirements we have for spy those requirements don't change those are really static it would take a lot for us to change it would be a big move in the market for us to change spy requirements or Q requirements or you know or Target requirements but what does happen is that because of a big move you could have a mark to Market or a paper loss that could drain some of the excess Capital which then puts you which could put you into a situation where you've got to free up some cash to hold positions let's go next slide now Tom you let Julia read a slide yesterday so do do I get the same uh you could you could take it from here pleasure you could take it from here so buying power reduction formula here's the all important uh formula for naked option strategies so the ones with undefined risk the underlying price plays the most important role in calculating the BPR followed by out the money value Then followed by the option premium and it's what I didn't realize at the time was it's 20% of the underlying price times 100 uh minus the outof the money value and plus the option premium with the out of money value based on the strikes distance from the stock price and we've got some great examples on the the next screen keep going so here we go if if you are selling the 16 Delta out of the money obviously um spider uh 45 days to expiry and those are naked short puts 20% of the spider price that's going to give you a BPR of 12,020 then you take off the outof the money value because it's 16 Delta we're so far away so you get a benefit of 3,764 but then you add back on the option premium 335 that gives you a total of 8591 and as you can see as the Delta increases so you're when you're at the money you don't get any of the out of the money benefit so then your your BPR reduction goes up to 13,110 uh slightly higher again if you are trading the the 75 in the money Delta so the distance between an out of the money and at the money strike price plays a huge role in why the BPR for an outof the money strategy is much less let's look at the strangle if it's a 16 Delta strangle how do we work out the BPR well you take the it's equal to the highest BP from the naked put or call side so whichever one's the highest that's what your BPR is going to be yeah that's good um keep going keep going so some Traders are curious why the BPR for their naked positions such as short puts short calls and strangles can suddenly change often increasing as it did to me a week past monday even when the underlying price stays the same aside from stock price movements the next big reason for BPR fluctuations is an increase in implied volatility a quick spike in IV can boost the option premium which in turn raises that BPR exactly keep going so now here's here's the stock that actually caught me because my biggest BPR and capital requirement out of my whole portfolio is of course in Nidia uh this Nvidia example demonstrates how stock movement and changes in the IV affect daily BPR fluctuations let's look at the one standard deviation strangle for February in Nvidia and you can see what happened here over those two Monday periods and this is great work from the guys because it's actually real numbers you saw that shock the stock price move from 143 down to 118 on the Deep SE news and the IV jumped from 48 to 72 this saw a surge in that BPR from 1,977 an increase of 119% to 4476 and this is what caught me off guard uh then you can see it drops back down after the market rallied so nicely on the Tuesday but then with a secondary shock on um Mr uh Mr Trump's tariffs then we saw uh an increase once more to actually higher V the implied VA went up to 74 and uh a BPR of 4,597 I'm I'm really surprised by those numbers those seem so much larger than I thought they would be yeah that's that's what really caught me out yeah that seems crazy to me that I didn't realize they were that big let's go next slide Beth therefore it is crucial to allocate Capital wisely into options positions typically we should keep our total committed trading Capital around 25% when IV is low because of course you want that room for a big um a big surge in in implied volatility remember January 2018 that was V mageddon and we when we saw V increase by um by more than 80% uh so so yeah keeping it around 25% then is uh the most efficient safest idea then when IV is elevated Traders have the opportunity to take larger positions to capture higher premium however any Capital allocation exceeding 50% and this is where I get a smack on the wrist uh 50% should be carefully monitored as this number can quickly expand if the market moves against the portfolio yeah I just want to say one thing here because we're running late these numbers are the most conservative case we have a moderate case which is about 33% higher we have a uh aggressive case which is 50 to 60% higher so so just these are this is the most conservative case because I don't want to confuse people and very few of us use the most conservative case most of us are in the moderate to more aggressive case let's go to the next slide Beth and we got to wrap it up yeah I'm right 785 % just now Tom do you want to take the takeaways buying power reduction can fluctuate significantly in undefined risk strategies due to stock price and implied volatility changes unlike theine risk strategies where the BPR is stable this can lead to over Capital allocation in your portfolio with adverse Market moves the key always stay small stay small and I like the moderate to aggressive case but you stay small BPR is mainly determined by underlying price out of the money strike distance and option premium with a strangle BPR based on higher the higher BPR of the naked call or the put whichever one's higher and allocate Capital wisely maintaining around 25% in low IV and monitoring positions over 50% in high I most conservative case to manage potential and Rapid um buying power expansion um and listen again keep size small you'll be fine
