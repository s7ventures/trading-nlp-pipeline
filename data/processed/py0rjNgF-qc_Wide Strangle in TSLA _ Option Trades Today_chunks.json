  "Welcome to Option Trades. I'm Tony the Baptist with a trade idea for November 5th, 2024. The market is strong today, with S&P up $49.50, NASDAQ up 209, Russell up 17, and Dow up 300. Volatility is down by 107, supporting the market rally.",
  "The market is rallying with volatility down 5.5%. Bonds are weaker, down 15, causing rates to go higher. The FED is expected to discuss reducing interest rates tomorrow. Adjustments need to be made in this market.",
  "I focus on the equity world and prefer stocks with high option volume. I avoid trading stocks with earnings. Tesla caught my attention with an ivy rank of 44.",
  "Tesla is up $866 today, leading the NASDAQ higher and trading at $251. The implied volatility of the options over the last 5 days has been rallying, with an ivy rank of 44 and no earnings. I plan to trade this stock with a wide strategy.",
  "I will be trading December options with 45 days until expiration. The stock has already had its earnings, so this is a post-earnings trade. I will be looking at the 200 put with a 10 Delta trading around $260 and the 335 calls with a similar Delta.",
  "The 335 calls have a Delta of approximately 10. You could also consider the 330s. The probability of profit is 83%. Theta decay is around $19 per day if volatility remains constant. Max profit is $465.",
  "Received $465 for a trade with a max loss that is potentially infinite. The one standard deviation lines are just above 300 and just below 205. Being outside of one standard deviation gives a probability of profit of 83%. Buying power effect is $5,000 on a trade worth almost $465.",
  "Get filled at the mid price or on the bid at 462 or 463. Break evens are just above 195 and just below 340. Over the last 45 days, Tesla has not been higher or lower than those levels. Outside the expected move and recent range, looking for Tesla to move within its $35 expected range over the next 45 days.",
  "$35 expected move over the next 45 days. This is a high probability trade, but there is always the risk of the stock moving higher or lower. When the Delta reaches plus or minus 15, I roll down the untested side to adjust my position.",
  "I increased my short Delta by seven or eight, leaving only seven or eight long Deltas. I remove Delta risk when my Delta reaches plus or minus 15. Check your position tab for updates. Visit the follow page to see the trade I put on.",
  "Bob the trader entered a trade at 10:09 this morning with the stock at $250.70. It is now at $252 with an 83% Pop. The trade was done at $461, a wide Pro post-earning strangle in a high IV stock that is in the news. This classic strangle trade will be monitored as the market reacts to earnings and election results in the coming days.",
