  "This analysis focuses on the tradeoff between time and money when choosing different profit targets in trading. The general approach is to sell premium and manage winners.",
  "Sell premium and manage winners is our main technique. How patient do you want to be with winners? Set a line. Previously set at 50%, but may need adjustment for different trades.",
  "targets. We found that a 50% profit target was not as effective as a 20-25% target. We decided to experiment with different profit targets, even with 45-day DT trades. How long should short premium trades stay in positions to reach various profit targets?",
  "positions we need to reach each profit target and what the probability of success is for each trade. Today, we will focus on trading SPY options with 45 days to expiration using strangles. We will analyze various deltas and profit targets to determine the most effective strategy.",
  "we're going to analyze how many trades reached their profit target and the average profit collected. This includes the average credit received multiplied by the profit target. Additionally, we will look at the average number of business days for these trades.",
  "What was the average number of business days you stayed in the position? If we exited at 21 DTE, that's about 20 business days later. Exiting earlier means we were managing sooner, while staying longer means we were holding past the 21 DTE line. Some trades never reach their profit target.",
  "When trading close to the money with 40 Delta strangles, a 50% profit target is more effective than a 25% profit target for managing trades.",
  "On average, 84% of trades reach a 25% profit target. Of the remaining 16%, only 6% end up as losers. The average profit scales as expected, with the interesting aspect being the number of days where a 50% profit target is reached.",
  "Trading at a 50% profit target is similar to exiting at 21 days to expiration in terms of timing. Staying in for a 75% profit target means holding for another week and a half, with minimal increase in profit.",
  "data shows that focusing on trades that are closer to the money can be more profitable in the long run. Only 35% of trades reach a 75% profit target, with the majority of profitability coming from trades that are around 50% or 60% at expiration. This suggests that aiming for a lower profit target when trading close to the money may be a more successful strategy.",
  "The main takeaway is to be flexible with profit targets when trading. Take profits faster when trading close to the money and be more patient when trading further out of the money. Let's see how this strategy plays out with other strangles.",
  "Here we consistently put on core positions for trades. A 25% profit target may be too aggressive as we are managing them quickly. Continuously adding new trades can cut into profits and result in losers outweighing winners.",
  "Only 5% of trades are profitable. A 50% profit target is recommended for 20 and 30 Delta strangles.",
  "The first row of this column on the slide is the most appealing for short-term trading. Profit targets of 25% are aggressive, while 75% targets are more reasonable. In 20 Delta strangles, the 75% profit target looks better.",
  "The 20 Delta strangle is increasing. I prefer a 50% profit target, but a 75% target is also reasonable. For selling 20 Delta strangles, this range is acceptable. Moving to the 16 Delta strangle, a 50% profit target may be too low.",
  "The 26 and 22 days are flipped. It should be 10, 22, 26. Looking for 75% profits out of your 16 Delta strangles doesn't take much longer, as those that reach 50% profits frequently also reach 75% profit not much later. This is partially because the credits are small.",
  "The small credits make it easier to move when in a good position. Consider adjusting mechanics when trading far out of the money options, such as a 161 Delta strangle.",
  "should consider being more patient with your profits. Wait until they have increased by at least 50% before taking them off. If the trade is past the 21-day line, consider managing it regardless.",
  "can afford to let it run a little longer without as much risk.",
  "Start by focusing on out-of-the-money options to allow for more patience in waiting for them to become profitable. This is a test of fixed points, not definitive profit targets. Adjust based on personal preferences and risk tolerance.",
  "Adjust your trading strategy to focus more on quality rather than quantity. Be patient with your trades to increase profits. If trading close to the money, be aggressive and take profits quickly. Replace trades promptly for better results. Focus on capturing winners consistently for a more profitable approach.",
  "Trading profitably with lower average profits can be more straightforward and intuitive due to smaller initial credits. By adjusting profit targets further out of the money, traders may achieve more consistent results over the long term.",
  "I believe it's important to refine management mechanics regularly."
