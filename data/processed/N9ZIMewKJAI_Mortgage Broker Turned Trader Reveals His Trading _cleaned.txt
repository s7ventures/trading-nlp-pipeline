options trading has created an opportunity for me to determine my future I think it's an Avenue for me to eventually sail into the sunset as an options [Music] trade hello everybody we're back I'm Tom snoff and we're here for another Rising Star episode of shoot tenis welcome thank you thank you nice to be here and great to have you here I think I think you and I have crossed has uh many times over the absolutely last handful of years at different live tasty events and um it's great to see her because I never know how anybody does you know like um I think you said to me once uh you're surprised how many people come to the live events but it's good to see because then you realize you're not alone yes yes exactly yeah I was curious because when I came to that event I thought it wasn't just going to be a sizable number of people but the whole place was full I had to go upstairs to the uh mees oh we we we've we've we we first started long time ago 25 years ago we would have events in our conference room yeah which was like about a third of the size of this room where we're doing right now and we' put people around the conference table and like six or eight people would show up um so yeah they would come a long way in that sense the first live show I ever did was at a university here in Chicago a small college and um he did in one of the classrooms and there was about 12 people and I think we all thought we were nuts how long ago was that 25 years 24 years yeah um so uh just to um give everybody a little background so so this Rising Star segment is is really designed to give you some insight into um retail investors do-it-yourself investors that have along the way discovered self-directed finance that have discovered um derivatives strategic investing and people that do it you know in in conjunction with or to complement everything else that you do exactly so uh on your bio it says that you own your own you own your own business you're a mortgage broker and uh you work with your wife and I don't know how many other people and um you and I we were talking about mortgage rates before and things like that but how much time do you have to to actually trade I do right in the morning cuz I have to create time I got to create time I think this options trading has created an opportunity for me to determine my future and I have to put as much time as I put in my mortgage brokerage business into this because I think it's an Avenue for me to eventually sail into the sunset as an options trade I love it I I saw there was a line I read in in your bio that you wrote up for us you said you watched almost every Market measure for the past decade yes yes and I still do and you still do so to give a little background um I think you said you and and I want to make sure I get this right but I think you said you started trading stocks or traded your first kind of stock trade about 2015 yes about N9 years ago yes yes N9 years ago yeah yeah and you told me when you went to University you were um uh you were a finance major but you also um didn't really believe in stocks I did not believe in stocks yeah cuz this was around the time when the stock market had just crashed 2008 September yeah and the professor wanted to find out what we thought about it and I took a stance that everybody in the class just looked at me wonder what's wrong with this guy what is he doing in this class cuz I stood up and said don't believe in stocks I'll never own some I'll never own any and it's a scam it's a scam yeah my dad used to think that way but other than that I think uh you know um but then you start thinking about it you're like okay well because in 2008 they scared the children you know I mean it was kind of a really it was a pretty long bull bare Market about you know almost 500 days and it was it was ugly the economic meltdown was was nasty yes and I guess if you were in school at that time and you're looking at it you're trying to kind of think about it in a macro sense it probably was pretty scary yes yes so do you remember your first stock trade I remember my first stock trade it wasn't the smartest because I paid $9.99 to buy I think two shares so my cost bases went up oh you paid $9.95 in commissions commission to buy two shares to buy two shares of stock to buy two shares of stock yeah two shares of what I was some really cheap stock so my my cost Bas is really scar so you couldn't have broken even if you wanted to I could not have broken yeah I forgot about the 9.95 commissions yeah um for two shares two shares yeah okay well in that case it kind of is a scam is a scam yeah CU not much you can do there yeah um but you know so so taking me through the process so for as first start off with two shares yes so so I started off with two shares and then a friend of mine told me you can't do this you got to spread your you know spread your $9.95 over several shares you could bring your cost bases down okay and then I met a friend actually a friend of mine was showing his trades on Facebook okay and they were weird like they didn't look like stock trades and then at that point he told me that he was actually trading options got it so I probably said what what the hell is an option exactly yeah yeah so I started learning about the strike price the expired date all these different metrics that come with trading derivatives and then I segwayed into trading options but I was taking the laws side sure buying calls buying puts and losing a lot of money okay all right that's fair yeah um but you were learning I was learning know I was taking L's for lessons in and a big part of what I always talk about with trading and especially you know any kind of strategic investing is you know you have to you know there's there's a saying in Chicago because this is kind of a blues City yeah you got to suffer if you want to sing the blues and I think that that's the case here you got to suffer if you want to see the blues a little bit so um so I'm going to fast forward uh to you you you started trading options it I learned around 2017 yes yes okay and like you said you started buying calls and buying puts but you're learning about making decisions you're learning about leverage you're learning about derivatives but you're not making any money not making any money so why'd you stay with it actually I took a pause so I took a pause so I could focus on my business at the time as a mortgage specialist uhhuh before I went into becoming a mortgage broker so I took a break from options and then I met a friend who told me hey there these two guys who banter and go at each other and they talk about options and they doing it differently so I watched one of your shows oh God you know and then that's when I realized wait you could actually take the other side of the yeah trade and that's when the tasty trade way started in September 2022 got it yeah got it so there's a there's a little bit of a fiveyear period in there where you know you're figuring things out and and listen actually in during that 5year period I was holding uh mostly Canadian Bank stocks so I was selling covered calls against them so they selling covered calls buying Bank stock selling covered calls which was probably a good trade yeah it worked out you're learning about Market structure you know you're learning about taking risk um you're reducing your basis yes okay so all all the above and then in 2022 you start watching tasty started watching tasty and then I got into this rabbit hole and all those Mo it's like Tik Tok exactly all those marcket measures that you and Tom you and Tony did from way back I just started absorbing all of them okay yeah and then I became intent on learning this and making something good out of it so when you started trading like tasty style 2022 let's say and um do you mind saying how old you are I am 36 36 yes okay so in 2022 you were 34 34 yeah okay how how big was your account size it was uh about 60 Grand cuz cuz people always write into us after we do Rising Stars say well you know was he trading with $2,000 or $5,000 or 200,000 or whatever it so it gives some context yeah yeah okay ex did your wife think you were crazy she thought I was crazy but then she did believe in me she I mean I had I had a track record of going into crazy things and pulling out okay like what uh going into the mortgage business okay was uh it's a 100% commission so going from a salary to 100% commission yeah that was a crazy jump okay that that is kind of crazy that was crazy yeah yeah and I you're just betting on yourself it's okay betting on myself exactly that's okay yeah yeah so she thought I was crazy but she believed it me and she just be okay so how'd you do in 2022 so 2022 was a short stint I only had I think a couple months and I was still learning so I wasn't doing too well I think it's not until May 2023 that things kind of clicked that's when I realize okay you just have to do as many trades as you can let the low of averages or the numbers work for you and eventually something's going to come out of it so I went down and then it picked up and then once it picked up it feel was no stopping after that so 2023 was really was really your breakout Year yes yeah and you did it your return investment was 100% yes so you doubled your money yes so then you got to think like so now you're cocky cuz now you're thinking like this I got this i got this thing down you're like I'm unstoppable right if I double my money every year I go 60 120 240 you know 580 and then I'm up to a million doll in four years I got this right yeah piece of cake I have to warn you that that's not exactly the way this works but um but and it didn't work that way there's always a a root Awakening okay how many trades you think you made in 2023 I used to do at least at least five trades a day five trades a day is you know is pretty close to let's call it on average that averages out to about between 13 and 1,500 trades a year yeah and you know that is that's a significant amount it's it's more than the average tasty Trader it's a little bit know it's a little less than stuff that we do but whatever that's a yeah I'm sure you didn't think before that you're going to be making when you paid $9.95 to trade two shares of stock in 2015 you didn't say wow in seven years from now I'm going to be trading you know 1500 times no no did not I think one of the most valuable takeaways from and one of the most empowering things about making 1500 trades is that you all of a sudden you know you feel like you don't feel like the markets own you anymore like you feel like you're responsible for your own outcome yes right it's not like you don't blame you know not blaming anybody else or there's no manipulation I'm rigged this is just you know either you know sometimes stocks win hopefully I win but but at least at that point you start to recognize this is what Market structure is all about this is what you know this is self determination yeah you know I'm a big freak about controlling what you can control which is obviously order entry yeah yeah yeah how much time do you spend with like managing the positions that you have on if it's a defined risk position I usually don't spend much time managing it uh if it's uh if it's a naked position then I will I'll I'll I'll manage it the time that I spend how much of your positions are defined risk versus naked I would say 50/50 50/50 5050 okay yeah before we get into like specific strategies and stuff like this have you been very mechanical about maning early yes so I manage a 21 days I try not to get tested yeah I'll move my wings I'll move my uh stries away if I notice that I'm getting tested I will roll like I I do roll um I realize that when you roll you actually take a loss but then I in most times when I rolled I yeah recovered what I loss essentially in the initial closing do you prefer any specific like sector or you know indexes ETF sectors or do you basically just rely on volatility I Rely solely on volatility it's good yeah i' like to hear mean reverting yeah so you're indifferent I'm indifferent I could care less what the stock does yeah yeah I like that good good good feel I feel like you're following the mechanics way better than most of our other you know Rising Stars so so it's a market measures I love that so um so after 2023 you know 2024 has been a little whenever you go straight up it's a little more difficult yeah um and 2024 has been kind of a straight up move so this year you're up money but just less yes yes I'm up in 2024 it was a huge lesson when the when that crazy Monday morning happened on August 5th on August 5th was a huge lesson for me I realized that I've been overextending myself mhm uh I didn't have any dry powder on the side to use and I ended up in a couple margin calls okay so I had to write up a trading plan I purposely actually sat down and I wrote a trading plan that has three key metrics so 50% buying power unused that's good any given time yeah 50% cash any given time and then uh the only thing is I don't trade as often as I would want to even though I could see the buying power is there but I I'm trying not to use it yeah but um there's more Capital that I'll be putting in the account that's going to help good I mean listen every once in a while you need an event that scares you straight that did and and that was when you think about that in historical context I know it was like you know one of the top 10 moves of uh whatever the last you know two decades but the reality is it it it wasn't very it was very shortlived yes I mean it was literally one day the next day we exploded so so it wasn't like something that had a lot of fall through and that you know it could have been a lot worse this is I guess my point when we talk about specific strategies is there certain strategies you like more than others yes so I love the broken wing butterfly yeah on you don't care what side I don't care which side yeah I'll do it on the C side I do it on the foot side yeah so that's one of them and then I love strangles MH I love doing short strangles I'll do spreads on both sides on the call side you mean like short vertical yeah short ver spreads yeah did you sell a lot of naked puts yes I love selling naked puts that's how I started actually that was the first market manager that I watched selling naked puts selling naked puts it works it's tried true and like tested yeah yeah yeah and um You probably don't do a lot of covered calls anymore but you know I'm guessing cuz it's just too Capital intensive exactly and I also find that my cover calls don't they don't do too well it it's just it's just not efficient you know I I shouldn't say efficient it's just not it's too Capital inefficient yeah yeah I completely agree as you kind of look into the future right now you're going to be you know you're trapped you're going to be doing this for the rest of your life I know look what you did to me talk I know you're not getting away like you can't get away you just because you're always going to think because there is always going to be opportunity yeah there's always going to be risk there's always going to be opportunity how do you think think about this like with um with all the other risks that you have running your own business because as as an independent you know um mortgage broker I mean you you have to go get your own customers you have to you have to make deals you have to refinance places you you know you have to the real estate market has to stay busy there's a lot of there's you have a lot of risk in that business yeah yeah yeah exact yeah and so how do you think about this in like kind of big picture yeah you know the interesting thing is I love what I do so I love both aspects of what I do being like helping clients find financing to buy homes and I also love trading options so it's a it's a nice balance between the two but eventually I'm hoping that when I'm on an island somewhere I could still trade options and not have to wear more pick it up phone to deal with to do real estate deals so this is like my sale to the sunset type of PL you no you know I I like the optimism there I don't think you're ever I I always used to say the same thing but I'm going to be here till I die so it do better yeah yeah but what I was thinking about in your business is that one of the things that we that I like to share a lot of is bonds and I would think that most people that are in like banking business and mortgage businesses and anything to do with like large Financial Services really don't don't understand some of the intricacies and Nuance knowhow of how bond market really works yeah and I would have to think that your ability to trade derivatives on you know on on like Bond Futures Pond options notes you know any ETFs like TLT and all that kind of stuff yeah really gives you a complete a very different unique perspective that will allow you to articulate like some of the um interest rate risk very differently than some other mortgage broker I would think that's a huge Advantage you're very right and I check the bond yield every morning I monitor it every day I see what the TLT is doing yeah and anytime there's an announcement I always rush to see how the bond market is reacting does that help in your conversations with with customers that you can actually explain it definitely does and I I'll give you an example so you have clients who try to get the lowest rate possible sure and most financial institutions will give you a lower rate if the bond yield has dropped sure so I have to explain to the client at this point we're not getting lower rate because look at how the bond market is doing yeah yeah I was once doing a uh work we were buying a building for work and we were negotiating with the um bank and and I remember I I had traded bonds all morning and I'm in there talking talking to this the person who was handling the mortgage side for commercial lending and they were trying to explain to me how interest rates work and I'm like I'm pretty sure you've never traded a bond in your entire life yeah and I think I traded like 200 of them this morning okay I go don't explain it to me I know how this works and they're like okay well most people don't understand I go I understand this okay just give me the numbers okay you don't have to try to explain this to me because you're explaining it is not how this works and I I just have to think that like for you you know it's got to be it's got to make you seem like you're just a another level above does yeah and and being able to explain you know how how markets are actually efficient in that regard and they and they basically move I mean mortgage rates move tick for tick with they do yeah there's nothing else to it by the second yeah it's not rocket science I mean they move literally tick for tick so um not that I want you to start hedging uh interest rates you know and offer that as part of your plan you know and uh you know here's a here's a half a million dollar house we're going to we're going to hedge your interest rate risk don't don't do that you you'll you'll drive people crazy so what's the game plan going forward in um 2024 like how do you get better now and like what about 2025 like like what's the you I think my my game plan is to get as many many people as possible into this because this is their way out and I've been what's considered a lonely options Trader for the longest time because you have your wins you have no one no one to share it with You' got your losses you got no one to you're here I can cry about all my losses today before I leave you know so my game plan is to get as many people as possible into this um hopefully uh eventually get my kids trading options as well how old is your oldest my oldest is eight boy or girl yeah it's a girl nice you have hope with a girl with boys you have no hope at eight oh girls you have a chance and I mean tasty live is always playing on my TV the whole day they probably think you're crazy they think I'm crazy yeah Dad this is the worst Dad this is the worst show ever can you put something good on yeah yeah I can imagine I can imagine so ultimately building you know building communities is is is obviously tough of oh the Traders things like that but I do see more widespread adoption do you see that slowly by SL slow the ones the ones who discover it they take it and they fly with it yeah and then hopefully they become really big fans and they'll get people into it yeah I have a friend of mine who got into it less than 6 months ago and he's reading charts and his name is Sam he's crazy about options he leaves breeds like everything think it does is just options traing that's great that's great so the adoption is there and it's eventually we hope the finance space takes on this other side where you just self-determine your you know active investing is well like I said before it's really important in life to um control whatever you you know the the more stuff you can control about your own decisions is yeah is the best thing that can happen to exactly yeah yeah yeah and this off has helped me with my decision making as well cuz you have to make decisions quick you know it has to help it could only make the way you process everything in your brain so much faster it's got to be a huge Win For You yep tennis thanks so much this was this was great thank you thanks for having me Dennis is our Rising Star I'm Tom snoff and I hope you enjoyed this thanks so much
