  "Welcome to Option Trades Today. I have two trade ideas for you on December 3rd, 2024. Let's quickly check the market - S&P is down $7.75. Consider adjusting your chart settings for better visibility.",
  "Charts show S&P down $7.75, NASDAQ up $10.75, Russell down $19.80, and Dow down 183. Volatility is up by 5 cents. If volatility remains low, it will be difficult for the market to see significant downside movement.",
  "market direction by looking at the overall trend and key support and resistance levels. This helps me make informed trading decisions based on the current market conditions.",
  "I like to see the IVX 5-day change be green, but with volatility low, it's hard to see any upside. The IV rank of 47 for Coin is high relative to the market environment. There are no earnings in Coin.",
  "Earnings in coin are good. IVX 5-day change is down 8% over the last 5 days. I want to be more directional in my trading. Planning to do a trade similar to last week's quick profit on coin, but only on one side this time.",
  "I am slightly bearish on coin, but it would need to double or more in the next month for us to be in trouble on this trade. Otherwise, we can make a nice profit. I will be looking to go as high up as possible and there is plenty of volume being traded.",
  "There is significant trading volume, indicating market activity. Despite wider market conditions, this option is likely profitable. Focus on implied volatility, which increases as stock prices rise, especially in options with a call skew.",
  "The 640 and 650 calls are similar in price due to increasing volatility. Lower priced options do not evaporate quickly on the downside because volatility keeps increasing.",
  "looking to take advantage of the increasing volatility by entering a trade with 45 days until expiration. I prefer a high IV rank and ideally, a rising IVX 5-day change. In this case, I will adjust my trade to capitalize on the current market conditions.",
  "I will buy the 600 calls once and sell the 650 calls twice. The mid price is $145, where I got filled. The stock was up when I made the trade.",
  "If you go to the follow page on Tasty Trade and click on Bob the trader, you'll see my two trades from today. I made a trade on a stock at around 311 and got filled at 145. I'll share the Boeing trade shortly.",
  "I removed a coin from trading last week for a $430 debit, which is now trading around $380 or $3.90. Some questioned why I took it off for a quick profit when it had a high win ratio and was performing well on the risk profile.",
  "I placed a trade on the 26th and took it off three days later. I bought one 600 call and sold two 650 calls, getting filled at $1.49 with the stock trading at that level.",
  "The stock is currently trading at $145, well above the expected move of $60. With a break-even point of $700, the stock would need to reach $650 for a profit. This strategy allows for a high probability of profit using capital efficiently.",
  "I have $6,200 at risk with a Theta of $10 a day. Delta is -3, making it omnidirectional. If we close at 650, the 600/650 call spread will be worth $5,000 plus the $145 credit received. Max profit is $5,145.",
  "At $650, our max profit is $5145. I aim to make around $100-$120 on this trade. It's a way to put $6000+ to work with a high probability of profit on a stock with upside potential. The stock could slowly rise to $610-$630, causing the 650 calls to lose premium and the 600 calls to gain premium.",
  "These 600 calls offer high premium potential with minimal risk down to zero. It's an omnidirectional slightly bearish trade. The next trade is Boeing (BA), which has been performing well recently.",
  "Boeing has been trending upwards recently, although it is still below its previous highs. I believe it will continue to trade within its current range. It's important to have an opinion when trading.",
  "I sold a strangle on Boeing with high IVR. You can view all my Boeing trades by clicking here. There are about 30 trades over three months. Visit tastytrade.com for more information on these trades.",
  "looks like almost six months of trades. Here are my trades in Boeing. You can see my success or failure in this stock. Check out the Ivy rank of 38. Let's go back to the high option volume list and find Boeing. Boeing has an ivx that is slightly green by about 1%.",
  "am looking to potentially buy calls or sell puts to take advantage of the low IV rank and potential increase in stock price.",
  "In Boeing, I am setting a strangle using January options. I will sell the 140 puts with a 20ish Delta and sell the 175 calls with a 20ish Delta to achieve a slightly short Delta position. This strategy is considered delta neutral.",
  "Delta neutral trading outside the dotted lines gives a 71% probability of success, compared to 65% inside. $11 in Theta Decay is higher than previous earnings, with less buying power used. Collecting $3.85 with $100 in buying power is more profitable than receiving $145 for a coin.",
  "$145 is more than twice the credit I received for my coin trade. The Theta decay for the coin trade is $10 compared to $11 for the Boeing trade. This is due to the higher monthly implied volatility in coin. Selling to 140 and buying at 175 with $1600 in buying power can result in a max profit of $384. The Delta moves slightly as the stock price changes.",
  "Delta moves slightly as the stock drops. I got filled at 385, one tick higher. If my Delta reaches plus or minus 15, I will adjust the trade.",
  "If the Delta on this trade reaches around 15 or 16 short Deltas, I will move up the puts until I have 5-10 Deltas on that trade. If this happens tomorrow, I may only need to move up one strike. For example, if I had 15 short Deltas and rolled up, I would pick up nine long Deltas.",
  "I adjust my trades by picking up or moving down Deltas to maintain my desired position. I recommend transferring your account to Tasty Trade for the best brokerage services.",
