I've tried to play memik stocks through buying long call calendars for relatively small debits I routinely struggle with deciding when to exit a call calendar spread that moves past my strikes unfortunately there's not too much Management on a call calendar spread a call calendar spread is the same strike intra month spread and unfortunately you want the stock to go to your strike price and kind of sit or slowly Meander to your short strike and sit if it goes there fast or goes through it there's not too much you can do yeah I mean you pick a number 25% of what you paid for it is like kind of what our research shows the reality is if you do a calendar spread you're taking a small amount of risk and you're going to make a small amount of money when you're right it's a lowrisk low reward trade
