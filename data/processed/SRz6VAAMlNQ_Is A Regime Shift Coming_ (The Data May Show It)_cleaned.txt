so last week we talked about how the market might transition between different regimes or states with their own unique statistical properties that tend to propagate for a sustained period of time um and identifying these regimes is a very important part of active trading would you agree with that I would doing the best that you can at least I think understanding that there are different regimes is interesting I don't I don't think you can actually understand them would you say that if you if there are certain indicators that suggest we might have transitioned regimes then it's important to maybe I would love somebody like you to be actually able to tell me that with with some form of certainty I mean all of it is just you know it's hearsay it's it hearsay that's a loaded that's kind of loaded I don't know it's it's that is a very traditional industry answer that tasty would not accept oh that's a nice way of saying that huh that makes it's not an acceptable answer at Tasty to say that we've entered into a new regime you can say that it looks like you can say for example it looks like the market has rolled over or you can say it looks like we like when you get a like a vix pop right you would adjust your portfolio adjust maybe some of your positions strategy here here's a yesterday is a perfect example you could have said after two down days you could have said hey it looks like we're entering a new regime and then today they're up then you'd be like oh no we're not you know my point is you really you actually never know with markets sure that's valid okay um what I want to talk about today sort of introduce this concept of regimes specifically when the market transitions to a high volatil volatility regimes I think it has very unique characteristics that a lot of us might recognize um as the market transitioning into a higher volatility regime when I think of like volatility regimes I think they're kind of ranked by like volatility you got like the low volatility Market Market I'll accept that counselor okay I'll that's that's progress Tony did you hear that yeah yeah yeah he's been very very um agreeable today so far I'll accept that only because I think it takes longer to move out of a volatility regime than it does like a stock that's all sure okay when I'm talking about Market regimes they're usually classified by volatility so that's maybe maybe a little more little more your bread and but butter um so I wanted to talk about um sort of recognizing them in some of those telltale signs uh and let's go to the next slide so like I said U Market regimes are usually classified by unique volatility price and macroeconomic conditions and transitions between regimes are typically initiated sort of by broader shocks to the market and so for example we might move into a bull market for example after an interest rate cut or some kind of announcement of fiscal stimulus for example a bare Market might come from interest rate hikes or geopolitical crises or something else um and then you have like crashes right so like very high volatility conditions that are caused by very specific circumstances so you got like the Great Depression Black Monday 2008 housing crisis the co crash um so again very specific circumstances that cause something as volatile as a crash but either way there are these sort of like triggers almost that might move us into a different sort of regime might not but yeah okay so let's go we're we're we're going along so far let's go to the next slide and so while Market regimes tend to exist for a sustained period of time their duration and stability tends to tends to vary um because they're right driven by pretty unique circumstances right we can agree about with that yeah but generally especially when we you know do quantitative back tests we sort of assume that there's somewhere between two and four market regimes with the exact number that you use it kind of depends on exactly how you're trying to test a strategy um and that's because so for example if you assume there's only two Market regimes you might lose some information about the granularity about these different regimes but that being said you reduce the risk of overfitting so like basically the risk of developing a strategy that works really really well for your historical data but doesn't work well in a generalized way for the future if you assume there's more Market regimes you might have more granularity but you run a higher risk of overfitting for example like developing strategies that might work really well for this historical data set but don't necessarily work well in general so the exact number that you would use really depends on what how you're trying to run your run your back test your analysis yeah I'm okay with that okay we're okay so far yeah going better than that's not bad yep hell yeah okay so let's go to the next slide so common indicators of a regime shift so like you've talked about identifying regimes volatility regimes in the market it's pretty difficult to do um but there's some telltale signs specifically when the market moves into a high volatility regime such as a selloff and for example when we like you know try to identify this regime shift a lot of the times they're characterized by very large moves in the market to nobody's surprise if we look at 3.7 daily like daily moves in um in the S&P either to the upside or to the downside we can see how they kind of cluster together so this is again this volatility clustering of these three sigma moves which again we have these big daily moves might be indicative that we've moved into a high volatility Market regime right one of these sort of indicators yeah MH 100% 100% as well as marked by let's go to the next slide increased intraday volatility which when we look at intraday volatility um we can see that they Spike around the popping of the Doom bubble 2008 uh we see a little blip around 2016 2020 and then we got the bare Market of 22 um which again can be kind of used as an indicator that we sort of trans positioned into one of these high volatility regimes don't see that every day okay let's go to the next slide and then as well our favorite indicator uh the vix um the vix is uh very very very rarely above 30 it does not happen an awful lot but when it does happen it's typically when we've moved again into one of these high volatility uh Market States um we did see it even earlier this year where we kind of popped above 30 but that wasn't necessarily sustained so it's not necessarily like a fullprof indicator but generally when we've seen the vix above third above 30 between 30 and 40 happens about 7% of the time or above 40 about 3% of the time that tends to happen when we're in these like Ultra volatile Market environments that again tend to propagate for a sustained period of time although the duration of that tends to vary because again they're triggered by very unique circumstances right absolutely 100% amazing let's go to the next slide and then we got another GIF guess what time it is it's GIF o'clock and then another pretty common indicator when we've shifted into this High volatility Market state is when you kind of see correlations to the market increase across broad sectors so here we got spy xlk XLV xly xop a bunch of these sector ETFs and what we look at these 30-day correlations when we had the co sell off in 2020 we can see that everything even utilities got a lot more correlated to the market which is why underlying diversification is so important even though these are rare circumstances when everything moves in correlation with the market and this is price correlation too we have to worry about volatility correlation as well like you want to be as Diversified as possible to sort of protect the portfolio from this sort of event happening yeah that's good pretty picture so this is another another indicator yep so let's go to the next slide um so predicting transitions between different regimes or the characteristics of specific regimes it's in real time it's a pretty interesting area of research but I don't think can be really used dependably by retail Traders generally speaking they could be used dependably by anybody I'm kind of inclined to agree um yeah I'm kind of inclined to agree but that being said uh and this is where I might lose you guys a little bit but uh let's go to the next slide but there are actually pretty reliable computational methods for detecting when a regime shift has already happened in real time and we've talked about some of the intuitive indicators like price correlation increasing intraday volatility increasing the vix increasing there's certain indicators that we can use but there's also computational methods that would typically used be used for other problems in engineering that we can use used to detect regime shifts in real time specifically when we classify volatility or when we classify Market regimes by volatility we don't I I'll go through all the other words on that slide but what do we think about that I think it's I mean I think you're genius I think it's okay I I I still don't know if it's if I I I still don't know how I still don't know that you can truly detect it but I think that you think that there's I think you can detect it but that doesn't necessarily mean that you can trade it if that makes sense like I might know that I'm in a high in hindsight in hindsight you can say it but I don't know that you can detect it happening that's well maybe that'll be next week's segment how about that boom that's what I'm talking about good job out of you oh yeah look love getting back into
