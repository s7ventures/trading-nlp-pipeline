  "I've run into a situation where I enter a trade and then the underlying security suddenly becomes illiquid when that happens would you stick with the mechanics or would you get out as soon as liquidity dries up I can't even remember a situation where I was in a trade and then the underlying suddenly became a liquid I've definitely been in trades that I've messed up and I did something in an illiquid stock and I didn't realize it was but there are certain stocks where we have entered a trade in",
  "certain stocks where we have entered a trade in an illiquid stock we regret the initial trade it is rare that you enter a trade and the stock suddenly becomes a liquid it is is very possible that you enter a trade and then you don't realize how liquid the stock really is that happens"
