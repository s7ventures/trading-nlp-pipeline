  "I've encountered situations where I enter a trade and the underlying security suddenly becomes illiquid. In such cases, it is important to decide whether to stick with the mechanics or exit as soon as liquidity dries up. I have been in trades where I unknowingly traded an illiquid stock, but it is crucial to be aware of liquidity when entering a trade.",
  "In trading, entering illiquid stocks can lead to regrets. It's rare for a stock to suddenly become liquid after entering a trade. It's important to assess the liquidity of a stock before trading to avoid potential issues."
