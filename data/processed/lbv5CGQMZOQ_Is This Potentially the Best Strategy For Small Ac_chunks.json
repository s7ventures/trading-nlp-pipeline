  "choosing the long for a poor man's cover call believe it or not we get this question all the time our research team decided to go out and maybe answer this question choosing the long for a poor man's cover call you want to bet want want to make a guess to what Delta that would be Tony I uh I I think he's gonna oh man uh 30-ish Delta is what hits me hits my head I think he's gonna go a little less and I'm going to say 26 you're going to say 26 Deltas yeah no no no for the long strike oh the long",
  "yeah no no no for the long strike oh the long strike I'm sorry okay I thought I was look at the short 70 Delta would be my default I'm hoping I'm correct let's take a look let's go to the next slide a covered call means selling a short out- of the- money call while holding 100 shares of stock or the underlying whatever it is this strategy generates additional Revenue compared with holding shares under any situation other than a sudden spike in the underlying we're still isn't exposed to a loss",
  "underlying we're still isn't exposed to a loss so 100 shares can be quite Capital intensive a poor man's covered called pmcc recreates a similar p&l dynamic um by using a in the- money long call in place of shares but how do we decide what long call to use what short call to sell and what kind of difference is so if you buy a stock it's 5050 let's just say if you do a cover call it's probably like 65 35 because you're selling you know you're collecting some premium so you're increasing your",
  "collecting some premium so you're increasing your probability of profit that's all it is you're capping your upside awesome Yep so that's why people do it it's a very um it it doesn't require any addition Capital gives you a higher probability of success everything's good there's no there's no downside to this um except you cap your upside so let's take a look and see what the team came up with is hey where where do I want to place my long in the money call and you know what should I do with my",
  "money call and you know what should I do with my out of money call let's take a look so we did 15 years of data um spy data and we looked at a variety of covered call um a variety of poor man's covered calls 45 days to expiration um 30 Delta calls that's the all the short options okay so all the long options we're going to use varying but the short options 30 Delta you're good with that I'm good with that I'm good with that yes yeah the 30 Delta is probably where Tony and I would be we",
  "30 Delta is probably where Tony and I would be we sometimes we say 35 sometimes we say 25 or 30 but 30 Deltas in the middle yep for the long calls 60 70 80 and 90 Delta strikes with the same expiration and then we looked at 60 days and 120 days or one year to expiration and all the positions were closed when the short option expired so 60 70 80 or 90 you still want to go with 70 I do okay we also included rich man's covered calls that results from using 100 shares a spy in place of the long",
  "from using 100 shares a spy in place of the long call at the same time frame just so you could see the difference okay so we called it a rich man's call let's go to the next slide okay so for starters here the first the first one and you can see them here this is the total of everything so 45 days to expiration here's the 60 Delta 70 Delta 80 Delta 90 deltas and then using the underlying stock um and you can see that the bigger the Delta it's a marginal change but obviously if you buy the stock",
  "change but obviously if you buy the stock you're going to do a little tiny bit better and if you right where Tony said is right in the middle okay the average p&l virtually the same there's almost no difference across the board and then the average Capital requirement you know why would you use $188,000 when you're making the same amount of money with the same win percentage basically right and Tony said the 70 Delta is probably right where I would be as well because your average p&l is perfect",
  "be as well because your average p&l is perfect 27 and your capital is on the second to lowest number I mean I guess there's there's no wrong answer when it when it works there's no wrong answer no there's never been a wrong answer here it's just it's all about Capital efficiency and getting yourself to a decent number that's all it is the key here was that the rich man's covered call wasn't that much more impressive then so so what we did here is we looked at the long call and again we compare",
  "we looked at the long call and again we compare we're just comparing all of these across the board can you go back one slide John yeah this is the 45 days to expiration because I just I I didn't point that out and so the first slide is 45 days to expiration on the second slide it's all the same numbers but we went we did the 60 days to expiration on the long call so we just extended the duration on the long call a little bit to see if the numbers changed and the reality was it was basically all",
  "changed and the reality was it was basically all the same so we went and we took it a step further and go to the the next Slide John we went to the sixth month long call now this is when you start to get into what we call leaps the interesting thing here is that the wi percentages basically didn't change at all the average p&l did not change at all the capital requirements went up so the capital requirements were about half if you were at 45 or 60 days than they are if you were at 6 months but",
  "60 days than they are if you were at 6 months but none of the other numbers I don't know if this is surprising to you or not none of the other numbers Chang at all yeah I wouldn't think so okay let's go to the next slide so here we went out one year and we wanted to see if the numbers changed and the win percentage did not change at all from one month from one year to 6 months to 60 days to 45 days nothing changes with the win percentages the average p&l surprisingly if you go out one year it",
  "p&l surprisingly if you go out one year it doesn't change either not at all what does change oh go what does change is the capital required so again if you went 45 days it only required $800 if you went 60 days it was like $1,000 if you went six months it went up to like 1,500 and now at a year it's 2500 so and this is all using the 70 Delta long call so the difference here is the longer you go out in time the amount of money that you put up that's what changes the capital efficiency of the",
  "that's what changes the capital efficiency of the trade the rich man's number never changes it's just all the people using calls do you know why that is because you're paying more for the call the the actual the actual pricing model the the the buying power requirement model doesn't change one bit the difference is the option that you're buying is way more expensive if you go out a year you're going to pay you know 10 times what you're going to pay for 45 days on the long call that's all it is",
  "pay for 45 days on the long call that's all it is understood there's nothing else to it you're just paying more money for the long call it's not like the the industry is charging you more money let's go to the next slide so some of the takeaways here um writing covered calls and spies generally been a successful strategy over the past decades sure it's basically worked into perpetuity because we've always had positive drift and the market goes higher Poor Man's coverage calls were able to",
  "higher Poor Man's coverage calls were able to recreate almost all the success of being long stock while requiring vastly less Capital when choosing a long call to form your poor man's covered call it was hard to go wrong but the 70 Delta and the 60 days to expiration provided a nice balance of capital efficiency without giving up profits or reliability compared to the rich man's covered call and then due to the length of the study expect current spy cost to be higher but the relative",
  "current spy cost to be higher but the relative differences between the strikes and expirations um should remain there's a couple of really good takeaways from this that it it's just it's a wonderful piece the most important thing is if you're looking for what strike to sell it's around 30 Delta if you're looking for what strike to buy you can do the we use the 70 Delta and that made the most sense if you're looking for the perfect duration that is the most reasonable relative to the credit you",
  "is the most reasonable relative to the credit you collect from a capital usage standpoint it's 60 days if you go out to a year there's no difference it just uses more capital all the other numbers stay the same I think this was the first time we've did an in-depth study of the Poor Man's covered call this way and I mean for me personally is very helpful"
