little back testing little back testing let's do it back testing feature is live for anyone that has a tasty account on the web-based platform which is my. tastytrade.com along the left side panel you will see the back testing button the little uh the little beta back testing beta button and it'll pull up this interface after you accept the terms and conditions yes signing away your life yes just kidding it's a cool feature where you can back test option strategies without putting up any risk it's basically a way to see how the strategy would have performed over a specific period of time in a specific ticker symbol you have entry and exit parameters you can customize as well so this is the first page you select your ticker symbol you can there's a they're built in so we don't have you don't have everything now hopefully at some point in the future I don't think it'll be everything but more selection they're adding more consistently but you can you have over 10 years of options data here you can customize and you can do it from this calendar yeah let's let's replicate the trade that I did for the written piece if you don't mind what do we do well I I don't I don't know you're go to we go to spy okay and then just keep the date the same January 1st 2023 January 1st 2023 yeah that's a default at least for this this one here oh why do I have to use your trade why can't I do mine I want to do my trade January 1 okay January 1 so you can select a strategy here you can go with a debit spread iron Condor whatever also build your own yeah just so you know but yes go on sorry I yeah you can custo you can customize it too I just made it kept it simple and I did a short put in spy so the way you can add other ones just so people know you can add legs like this up to four legs and you could change them Buy sell you could do any sort of custom funky thing you want to do you know selling a put spread to buy a call spread whatever whatever you want to do yeah yeah so yeah I did a short putut in spy I did adjust a couple things here so on this interface you can see your trade entry parameters and your exit parameters so I changed the Delta from 30 to 50 oh right at the money the money big risk taker um I also disabled the exact DTE okay so y because spy has weekly options like I don't really care about the exact day I I just want to get as close as possible and just keep this thing running yes I also limited the next one below it I limited the number of active trades so what that will do and I click the second one here oh close the old one and open a new one so with this and I change it to one one so this just ensures that the parameters will not go more than one contract at a time it's it's open close open close you won't you won't have open open open open and have like 10 trades on yes okay and then the only other thing I did here was I closed at 50% profit on the bottom right okay so you can change that to 50% there yeah yeah so 50 Delta put closest to 45 days have only one trade on on a time roll at expiration if it's still there uh and it has not reached the 50% profit but if it reaches the 50% profit it will close and open a new one and open a new one exactly and a couple things to note so you can of course change the quantity as well you can change the Delta and the expiration just keep in mind there you can't so for ease and simplification we're using Delta as opposed to strike because strikes are very different especially when you go back in time when things are lower priced you know if you're doing $5 wide spreads in spy 10 years ago that's a way different position than a $5 widespread now so when you use Delta it kind of accounts for some of that difference in in relative value it also makes it so that you know you don't miss specific strikes right so not every stock is going to have dollar wide strikes where you can pick exactly this strike so using Delta using the 50 Delta is basically just at the money regardless of whatever the stock price is exactly good and you run it and get your results easy yeah pretty quick yeah so what's cool about this feature is the orange line is your test so the orange line is your back test with all your parameters you can you can see at the top there all the all the things we entered as well short putut every 45 days and all the conditions that apply and the Gray Line on this chart is if you were to just buy and hold spy so you can see but they're not the profits aren't together it's price of spy corre correct yeah so this is like spy is at 567 at the end and you've made 8 Grand yeah so they're the it's not just buying and holding it's just the price of the underlying mapped with the profit got it so as you can see short put in spy still does very well especially with these parameters still does very well even in a a ripping Market to the upside yeah your biggest draw down here was likely just now at in the August cycle when spy was was aggressively dipping um but you made it back on on the way back up yes so yeah nice feature here and then that's on the summary tab so the details tab is another way where you can see some more trade metrics and actually if you go back to the summary tab real quick and scroll down a little bit you can see your total profit average profit or loss Max draw down and return on Capital that's used so some basic info there but then as Nick clicked on the next tab you can see a bunch of other metrics much more detailed trade by trade p&l you can see the biggest losers biggest winners and naturally that that big volatility along the right hand side was the August Melton we had and then the quick recovery a lot more metrics there that you can analyze Y and the last tab the logs this is where you can get really granular if you want you can look at every single line item you can do it by trades orders transactions and you can download this as well so if you are a savant in the N if you're a freak in the sheets you can download a freak in the Excel sheets that's good that's decent that is very good you can download the data and you can analyze it yourself if you wanted to do something different fun yes so this is now available if you have a web based if you have access to a browser and you have a tasty account my. tast trade.com yes uh and again I will be writing a piece on this if you want written info on it there's a help center article that already exists on the tast trade help center um but I use this trade exactly so this will be nice be nice Synergy you know when you're reading and watching the video that we will surely embed within that article as well
