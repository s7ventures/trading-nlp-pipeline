  "the title is why neutral strategies May dominate a strategy dominates when it achieves equal or higher returns while bearing equal or less risks so what are we looking at here we got the expected returns as a percentage and then the standard deviation of risk you're saying more risk more expected return exactly La leis race returns ex all right going on to the next one here so examining straddles so it's reasonable to assume that the offsetting Delta would would reduce the directional risk and",
  "Delta would would reduce the directional risk and the straddle would be more profitable than either leg on its own in terms of risk taken and return so you're looking at a straddle versus each position so what you're saying is you're you you you're you have more risk potential just on one side of the market on either side of the market whether it be puts or calls you have more risk on just a single position because you don't have that Delta hedge from the other one so just this we be testing to",
  "from the other one so just this we be testing to uh those in indidual leg right put or call and then we put all those RS together which will be hedging both sides right and those results in in case of risk we're going to use standard deviations all right so getting on to the next slide here so how is this uh position how is this assumption played out historically does the risk reward advantage of a neutral strategy make it noticeably Superior to a directional premium selling so you're you're",
  "to a directional premium selling so you're you're going to take uh neutral positions compared to one or the other directional premium selling position naked calls naked puts exactly all right so let's get to the study here so the study 2005 to present every trading day Place trades close to 45 days so you compare it selling at the money puts you're managing them at the 21 days at the money calls manage at 21 days straddles manage at 21 days and then the strangles manage at 21 days I'm uh Little",
  "the strangles manage at 21 days I'm uh Little T typo there right yeah uh 21 days and then so you're going to look at the average returns and the Ste standard deviation of returns um or the standard deviations of risk of risk of risk okay so we're going to see how wide the risk is as well as the Returns on all those strategies right you got a lot of you got a lot of data here this over the last 20 years right 05 till till now just about 20 years 19 years so a lot of information go ahead all",
  "19 years so a lot of information go ahead all right so the stradle achieved both higher returns and lower standard deviations of risk even though the call side loss most of the time if you look at a chart of spy it has gone up since that that time so you're naturally going to be losing on the call side tell me what we're looking at here so we got annualized p&l as a percentage of the underlying first of all when you take a look to this table the I mean numbers speaks by themselves right okay",
  "I mean numbers speaks by themselves right okay when you see at the money call the money put in the stradle this is the first table we compare the stats on both sides neutral neutral strategy when you look to uh annualize pnl as a potential of underlining you see at the money P have 32% at the money call it's a rul trade right negative 40% and strle outperform by 40% which means we have better returns when you compare neutraly and both when you compare one leg one leg by its individual stats",
  "compare one leg one leg by its individual stats right when you go to their risk which is standard deviations here didn't I didn't put percent percentage I I use actual numbers actual uh money right okay so it shows by at money call it's 130 right and the money puts 841 the Str which is neutral shows 602 and remember when you trade the only Ric which is simple for RO for everyone who trade we know like if you take huge risk the return will be also huge right yeah and if the minimum risk you take",
  "huge right yeah and if the minimum risk you take also returns you can expect huge returns right but take look to the uh neutral strategy strle have 602 risk in terms of standard deviation right and other at the money put have 800 at the money C have 600 and 330 so this give us the indication like in your life we don't need to be mediocre right Tom hates this strategy if we don't have to be mediocre right we need to take sides but in you tra when you are trading I prefer to stay neutral when you",
  "you are trading I prefer to stay neutral when you don't take won't take uh huge risk yes we th this shows me that we've obviously had some positive drift up over this period of time and then you know I'm in both cases of being bullish or bearish like if you're on one side of the trade you should expect to have um bigger uh potential returns but you're also going to have bigger risks because you have any there's no hedge in place on entry and so it's easier said to done than done to look at 2005",
  "easier said to done than done to look at 2005 to now and say oh well I should have just sold puts the whole time you know that's a hindsight look back um even if you are selling at the money puts you're going to see the losing trades the standard deviation of risk to be much greater than have with the straddle you don't have the upside profit potentials as the as uh the naked puts do but you're going to have wider losses your your overall standard deviation of returns can be much much wider",
  "deviation of returns can be much much wider because you have those tail losses proces yeah even if you look at you the return in terms of um return on on your Investments you will see the the call it's negative 1.6 and the puts it's one and the sh it's 2% that's annualized return on investment we get if you see the standard deviation of your return on investment which is the risk M so the puts will be higher right because there's so much noise right there but the strle which is neutral strategy",
  "there but the strle which is neutral strategy will be slightly lower according to the puts all right jumping into the next slide here then um so even the Strang will achieve both higher returns and lower standard deviations of risk even though the side was a losing trade and and this is I mean anytime you look at a long time frame you're always going to have losing short Delta positions when you when you see the mark the market as what effectively 3x in since 2005 2x minimum um I mean we're",
  "3x in since 2005 2x minimum um I mean we're right there so you're obviously going to have losses on any neutral or any short type position the the thing to to key in on is that you're you know the law the losses on those select times to the downside are much much greater because you don't have any sort of hedge on you don't have any sort of short Delta on your position you're you're one to one to the downside you see it here with your standard deviation of risk being you know much higher on the",
  "of risk being you know much higher on the out of money puts exactly and when you compare this slide with the previous one you this Trad up has potential of losing more than strango right yeah if you see to in terms of risk the stro has more than three 3x of ring more than strangle has uh like for example St have 600 of the risk but on this triangle we have like 200 right which is my recommendation I don't need to take recommendation right but this triangle kindly outperform in terms of risk",
  "this triangle kindly outperform in terms of risk management when you're looking to longterm positional you have more you can do with it when you're selling a put or selling a call you can only roll it out in time or roll it up and out if you're on the call side if you have a strangle or straddle you can roll both those options are are bringing in premium and are bringing in value that you can capture over a period of time whereas with one-sided trades if you're wrong on direction that that part",
  "if you're wrong on direction that that part of the the the trade is tough exactly and I don't think there's someone who want to do the calls the wrong time because Co sucks right yeah reason to say Co sucks so D I mean until they work the the one once or twice all right let's move on to the takeaways here a couple more so while neutral strategies appear to outperform directional ones we may still look to take directional positions to stay engaged and build core positions there's nothing wrong",
  "and build core positions there's nothing wrong with having a directional assumption exactly um however you build it you know the things that we control on Entry or volatility time or how heavy our directional assumption is those those are the things that you can ultimately control uh with your positions however a purely mechanical approach looking to optimize returns give given certain levels of risk may be exclusively to stay neutral if you're trying to to take less risk on both sides of yeah",
  "trying to to take less risk on both sides of yeah we we don't you don't we don't mind if you take a direction on any side but remember to say a mechanical use mechanical approach for you to control your trades and be small yeah be small all right last one takeaways so neutral strategies don't require any additional buying power so it's logical to sometimes avoid picking a direction selling the call doesn't you know against uh if you're just selling puts if you're selling a call against it won't",
  "puts if you're selling a call against it won't use additional Capital brings in more premium gives you a little bit more um potential value to capture through the life the trade in the exam example of the Spy straddle and strangle it achieve both higher returns and lower risk than its individual components obviously you know positive drift over 20 years helps but uh in the short term on a trade bytrade base better off with the neutral position exactly"
