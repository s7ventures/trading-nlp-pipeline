jumping in this is the importance of managing Jade lizards so let's jump I love that Jacob knows we're on and he's bringing on a jade lizard study I know and I and I'm very curious to see what this is going to say because the Jade lizard in a bull market if you don't manage it early you can go from having a winner to freaking even having a non loss is not a winner right so okay managing Jade lizards Jade lizards are an advanced option strategy for Traders with a neutral to slightly bullish directional assumption looking to make short premium trade true to s Jade lizard a short out ofth the money put option is combined with a typically closer in the out ofthe money call spread the distance between the call strikes is less than the credit received there's no upside risk the downside risk is unavoidable at Tasty we often advise exiting short premium option short premium positions well in advance of expiration what effect has early management had for a persistent seller of Jade lizards all right let's this isn't this is great let's keep moving and he's got it all right okay the study so they're using 15 years 15 years of options data in spy iwm triple Q's Apple Amazon and Google that's a lot considered selling 45 dat lizards at every monthly expiration using a 20 Delta short putut and a 40 and 30 Delta call spread okay so with that 40 Del 30 Delta call spread you're maybe not covering the width of the spreads I do a lot of back testing on Jade lizards but they but they have to use Delta have to use a Delta so if and so with this study there there may be a little bit of risk to the upside but I like it I love any Jade lizard study bring it and I like that that they're covering their bases because these are the these are the big the big liquid big liquid products all right let's go to the next slide and this is over 15 years the study contrasted holding these positions through expiration with closing them at 21d okay so this is interesting because I you and I kind of say you close your Jade lizard when it's going to go when it's nearing your call spread not necessarily these parameters but he's got 21 days till expiration and when you're using that back testing you can choose close at a certain day or close at a certain percent of profit um and sometimes when I'm looking at it I will look at you know compare closing them at 50% or closing them at 30% or closing them sometimes when it's going through that call spread you're only getting 20% so uh here he has closing them at 21 DTE and they analyze the percentage of winning trades the net average p&l per trade and the conditional value at risk the cvar average of the worst 5% of outcomes okay that's just like this is just the setup this we can kind of go through quickly analyze more of the more of the rest of them number four please okay uh win rate spy iwm triple Q's 79% 7 this is held through expiration 68% average p&l are you surprised that iwm is negligible 2.55 five 2.55 no I'm I'm more surprised that spy has a $38 hold on hold on one second I'm just gonna pull I'm gonna pull up his parameters and spy just want to see what it looks like we Talk Amongst yourselves the next one if you want to well this is 15 years okay so this is 15 years of of data it's also running through covid and I know from testing some of these a lot of these a lot of strategies really take take a big hit as your you know your p&l you'll see your p&l climbing climbing climbing climbing you hit that covid era and it it goes really negative and then it takes from then until now to get back up into the positive I'm not surprised now here we have closed at 21 DTE look at the difference now all of them more higher high higher average p&l but M much much higher in iwm and triple Q's spy minimally higher minimally higher but the conditional value at risk and spy went down by 2third because you're closing them at 21 days you're not letting those puts get close to expiration and the they're all over 80% win rate yeah this is fascinating to me so but I usually don't let my now I will say this I usually do not let mine go until expiration the Jade lizards Jade lizards so I I mean this is the one that I will say 21 I'll either close it and then reestablish it somewhere else close it and manage it I'm never rolling up a put we're never managing it by rolling up a put the one thing you can do in these with the Delta parameters Jenny is you could take and roll down the calls if you needed to because they're pretty wide when you look at this like average p&l we've always said iwm is a good candidate because it's much lower priced you're using much less buying power I don't think it's that the conditional value at risk isn't that much more than spy no but you know you're looking at spy which is so much higher price and Q where you're using a lot less buying power in iwm it I kind of like the average p&l there I do too I do too okay let's see because then there's then they they're going to do it in apple Google and some other things too let's take a look so here's held through expiration okay look at this held through expiration you're losing money on Apple look how much you're making in Google but that's before a lot of this is before the split so you're getting Hefty premium for some of those puts look at the win rates in these I mean what I saw I mean you I expected the win rates to be around 70ish percentile right you know 68 70 72 I consider all those the same number I mean I'm not going to tweak those but to your point in the in the last set I would choose iwm for its low Capital usage especially if you're GNA if you're going to close it at 21 days and here now I feel like it's a lot different you look at the SAR and Amazon and Google well now they've all split so now you're looking at a $150 product instead of hundreds of dollars yeah okay so let's see when you manage it at 21 21 days the sear is still pretty high in these closes to 21 days well they were expensive products I mean Amazon was so so expensive so okay looking at these I think I think the main takeaway from me is I'm never going to let it go past 21 days no I no I it's okay so here's I love this and I love this study and selling jid lizards and running all my back testing yes I I would close at 21 days but we do also love the zero DTS and the weeklys but it's different it's a different strategy it's a different they're different that's not that you that's like apples and girs those aren't even the same it's not like a jade lizard if we're putting on a jade lizard in one of these big products we're closing at 21 DTE this way you can't talk about zero DTE in the same breath or even the weeklies we got lots of people who love trading the weeklys and I know most these studies show best results closing at 21 DTE and I think that is for the you know these big products it can't be the weeklys because the weekies are gone after today like the zero DTS are gone it's the it's the Jade lizard and these bigger products close it 21 DTE for the best results yeah I mean hands down what I've been loving too is taking these Jade lizards and putting them over stock positions oh yeah like because because when you're looking at that you're getting premium selling but you've got the directional bias in there and then because there's no risk to the upside if if your product goes up then you pick back up to the upside of the of the Jade lizard it's a double it's a double negative because you've got you're you're doubling down to the downside but I do like that let's look at his takeaways okay final final slide takeaways selling Che lizards can be a profitable trade when looking to collect premium on neutral to slightly bullish assumptions both ETFs and equities closing Jade lizards at 21d saw improvements in all trade metrics considered only in Google were Traders holding out through expiration able to make more money but this was the cost of less frequent winners remember it was only 50% and significantly worse bad losers that had the biggest conditional value at risk the next time you identify a good candidate to sell premium but can't decide on an option strategy consider a jade lizard just remember to manage early I and that is a key takeaway with those Jade lizards manage early and I from my experience looking at some of running the looking at some of the test results managing at 21 yields way better results than managing at 50% like if you're if someone says I'm just going to manage at 50% and leave it but then doesn't manage at 21d I think that hurts you in the long run well because I also think it's a battle right you're collecting so much more on the put than you are on that call spread but you want it to go towards that call spread so you want to be making more on the put than you're losing on that call spread so it's a battle I think that I think 50% of a jade lizard is a little bit is a little bit right so I hard to get agree so I think that that 21 day Mark is more important than the 50% I do too I don't know that you're going to hit 50% before 21d so just keep it simple 21 days till expiration I kind of agree
