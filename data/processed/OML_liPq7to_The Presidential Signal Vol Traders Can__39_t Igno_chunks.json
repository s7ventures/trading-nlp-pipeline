  "In analyzing market volatility during presidential terms, we compared the success rate and premium collected from spy short strangles in the last two terms (2016-2020 and 2020-2024). We used implied volatility rank to assess option prices.",
  "The study explores how varying volatility levels have influenced market conditions across past presidential terms. The table shows the frequency of each volatility level during different time periods.",
  "During the Trump Administration, the VIX was under 10 for 7% of the time, which did not happen under Biden. Volatility has been slightly higher since the pandemic.",
  "volatility was low under Trump, with only a few rallies. The pandemic in 2020 affected trading, leading to a slow period from 2023 to 2024.",
  "In the last eight years, volatility in the S&P 500 has mostly ranged between 10 and 30. Only 1.8% of the time has it been over 40, and 13% of the time it's been over 30. This is the typical range for recent years.",
  "This period has seen low volatility, indicating selling options when IV rank is low may not be ideal. Waiting for IV rank over 30 to initiate trades may also not be practical. Considering a more aggressive approach may be necessary. Results across different IVR environments from 2016 to 2020 show focus on the 0 to 30 range.",
  "We focus on the 0 to 30 range as it appeared more frequently in recent years. Success rates don't change much between 10 and 20, 20 and 30. The average P&L surprises me, it should have been better. The return on investment is between 10 and 20 because we stayed there most of the time. The success rate is good, but the numbers don't jump.",
  "The success rate and numbers are more favorable when looking at the 20 to 24 time period. There is higher volatility, a higher success rate, dramatically higher average P&L, return on investment, premium, and buying power required. These numbers are more interesting.",
  "The takeaway is that there was higher volatility post-pandemic. It didn't matter if it was Trump or Biden, but rather the post-pandemic environment. There wasn't a clear impact from either administration. This was more of a meme stock trend.",
  "This stock was influenced by meme culture and the pandemic, making it unpredictable. It's difficult to predict volatility based on a specific factor. Higher volatility typically results in better returns.",
  "Comparing the two terms, we see that the average profit and loss increased by over three times on average in the second term. The premium collected doubled, return on investment rose by three and a half times, and buying power only increased by 1.5 times. Trading is better under higher volatility.",
  "High IVR presents ideal opportunity for selling options. Recognizing that volatility often clusters at lower levels, we should consider being more proactive.",
  "Being proactive during low volatility periods in the last two presidential cycles has shown to increase profits and collect more premiums. By adopting a more aggressive approach and managing positions early, traders were able to capitalize on the market conditions. This strategy tends to be effective when volatility is low."
