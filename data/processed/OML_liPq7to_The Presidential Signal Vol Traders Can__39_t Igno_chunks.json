  "presidential terms and Market volatility let's take a look at where the team went with this our last election piece we looked at 2016 to 2020 and 2020 to 2024 we looked at spy short strangles because we're looking for stuff to do today we looked at the success rate the premium collected everything else we compared the results across the last two presidential terms the four years of trump and the four years of Biden we use the implied volatility rank to gauge option prices it reports expensive",
  "rank to gauge option prices it reports expensive options near a 35% reading when IV is near its highest level of the year in this study we aim to explore how varying volatility levels have influenced market conditions across past presidential terms interesting this table shows the frequency of each volatility level now again we're looking at uh one year 23 to 24 then 2016 to 2020 and 20 to 24 so I'm covering all the bases here and the amount of the percentage of time that vix was in you know",
  "the percentage of time that vix was in you know different ranges in the Trump Administration the first one it was weird we got down to a seven we got down 7% of the time that vix was under 10 never happened under Biden never happened the last year of course um and the funny thing is that when you look at the rest of the numbers they're not they're not that crazy volatility has been a little bit higher since the pandemic um you know a lot of people think that under Trump we had these crazy czy",
  "think that under Trump we had these crazy czy volatile times and all this other stuff but the reality is we didn't really no was business as usual just like every other president right most of the time 63% of the time volatility was in the crapper you know it only rallied a couple times under Trump 2020 we did have the pandemic built into there so when you look at 2023 to 2024 87% of the time we did nothing was kind of a very weird slow you know slow time and then in 2020 to 2024 you know the",
  "slow time and then in 2020 to 2024 you know the whole picture it kind of broadened out things a little bit more and um you can see over the last eight years we have not had you know 1% of the time or sorry 1.8% of the time total in the last eight years the volatility has been over 40 and only 133% of the time it's been over 30 you know this is where we live most of the time in recent years implied volatility of the S&P 500 has ranged between 10 and 30 that's very fair this period has been",
  "10 and 30 that's very fair this period has been marked by relatively low volatility which suggests that selling options when the ivy rank is low may not be ideal waiting for High V rank over 30 to initiate trades Also may not be practical as we've observed IV can decline remain low for extended periods given this should we consider a more aggressive approach so this shows the results across different ivr environments for four years from 16 to 20 and we focus on the 0 to 30 range as it appeared",
  "and we focus on the 0 to 30 range as it appeared more frequently in recent years and it serves as a useful comparison so the success rates don't really change that much between 10 and 20 20 and 30 the average p&l obviously surprises me because I think that it it it should have been better and the return on investment is between 10 and 20 just because we stayed there most of the time I think that's the real reason but none of these numbers like that the success rate's good the numbers don't jump",
  "the success rate's good the numbers don't jump off the screen at me as anything much let's look at a different time period so we look at 20 to 24 um this is a lot more interesting because we actually had SL higher volatility as you remember the success rate's a little higher the average p&l is dramatically higher the um the return on investment is dramatically higher the premium is much higher and the buying power required is also higher these numbers are a lot more interesting and the takeaway",
  "are a lot more interesting and the takeaway from this is that we had much higher volatility post pandemic I don't think it mattered that it was Trump or Biden I think it mattered that it was post pandemic and there was just there was it took follow through for a couple of years but you can see I agree I wish you could point to I wish you could point to Administration and say that there was V to one or the other but there really wasn't no I think this was more of a meme stock thing and then a",
  "this was more of a meme stock thing and then a and then a pandemic thing than anything else so I think I guess the kind of some of the takeaways here is it's hard to predict based on a certain candidate how high volatility is going to be like because I don't I just don't think it's that easy and again and it's hard to predict what kind of you know unknown events are going to happen but higher volatility def definitely leads to better returns in comparing the two different terms we observe the",
  "comparing the two different terms we observe the following impacts the average profit and loss increased by more than three times on average in the second term the premium collected was up two times the return investment rose up to three and a half times and the buying power only increased by 1.5 times so just making the argument not making the argument that trading is better under a democratic Administration making the argument that trading is better under higher volatility and trying to say",
  "better under higher volatility and trying to say that it really has nothing to do with who is the president has to do with you know what happens and where's the volatility so some of the takeaways when we look at these two presidential terms the last two presidential terms High ivr presents ideal opportunity for selling options however reaching those extreme levels is very rare recognizing that volatility often clusters at lower levels we should consider being more proactive sometimes okay not",
  "consider being more proactive sometimes okay not always but sometimes during the last two presidential CHS we generally saw low volatility lels by adopting a more aggressive approach and managing positions early we're able to increase profits and collect more premiums and that was kind of that was an a across theboard message that's that's generally the case when volatility is low"
