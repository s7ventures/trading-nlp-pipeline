welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today January 21st 2025 but first as we always do let's take a quick look at the market even &ps up 32 handles that's about where they were from most of the night 25 to up 30 when we came on the show earlier this morning but you can see here they've had a big range of almost 80 plus points on the Emin snps up to around 78 just a few from where we are right now all the way down to under 6,000 NASDAQ doing the same with a big range up 46 Russell up 37 and the Dow up 443 volatility in by 66 cents you can see here trading near the lows this is what I look at SL VX that's the volatility Futures I think it's the best indicator for daily movement and volatility better than VI and better than anything else that's what I watch the vix Futures the vix Futures remain weak we typically get an extended move to the upside if volatility Futures seem to Rally or hold a little bit the up move seems to wne off and maybe you get a down move bonds up 23 ticks Bitcoin had a big range last night from under 100,000 to over 110,000 it sits mid-range at 106 and now I bring you to the product I'm going to trade that's right the world's worst commodity Trader is going into oil oil traded down to 75 and change up to almost 78 it's sitting at mid range uh down a dollar and change at 7621 Ivy rank is pretty good at 28 and change it's been up ticking as you can see here down on the bottom it's at the higher end of its range so I am going to use an omnidirectional trade here to do something in oil you may ask why are you going into oil well when I take a look at my watch list here and I have the high option volume list and I've taken away all of the earnings just by clicking this button here I click all the earnings I put them in order you'll notice that there's not a lot of stocks with the ivx 5day change expanding and or IV rank very high matter of fact all of these stocks here are very difficult uh to trade especially with the low implied volatility that they have here so I am going into to CCL now I am the world's worst commodity Trader so take that with a grain of salt now I did do this trade when oil was down around 90ish cents so it may have moved a penny or two which is actually a decent size move on the option sides because these options are now $10 not one penny I'll explain that to you right now in a moment what options am I looking to use well I'm looking to use uh the March option options here now you U may need to decide what month you're going to go to I'll make it pretty easy for you if you look here on the Futures they're trading 7617 but as you go down a little bit further you'll see that these February options are really tied to a different month future on the tasty trade platform it's very easy for you because each one of the the options that are traded the clear it's clearly represented by the future that those options are represented so there's a little bit they're trading 76 and change the next month is trading 75 and change I'm going to go to these March options with 55 days to go you say why not go to the options with 34 days to go and I said I would make it easy for you and I'll show you why I'm going to open up those options and you'll notice that there's no volume in these options the markets are also five or six cents wide which is 50 or 60 doll wide not five or six cents wide I'll explain that to you in a moment when I when I get to the next page let's close that up and go to the um March options with the at the money being around $75 the March options you'll notice are very liquid good markets closer to two or three cents wide and plenty of volume on each side of the market so now that we know where we want to go we know what what the price of the O of the oil this is barrels of oil are trading 75 and change this line right here in the m is the at the money line so you'll notice that corresponds right to the Futures it's in between 75 and 75 and a half I'm going to do a one by two ratio spread now you can do this trade in an IRA account to it's just going to take double the amount of buying power now just to prove a point here I'm going to show that you this option at a dollar it's actually ,000 $1 no it's moving sorry $1 in an option is ,000 in premium I know if you're on the equity side you're used to a dollar being a $100 well oil future options are 10 times the size so this is a very large trade even when you're making it small let me show you what I'm looking to here just like any other type of ratio spread I like to buy the strike that has a probability of at least being in the money so what am I doing here I'm going to go to somewhere around the 20ish option why let me explain I'm going to get rid of volume here for a moment and go to probability of a touch when you go to probability of a touch here you'll notice that these 20ish Delta options are around a 5050 chance of touching this number now I'm going to choose the 83 strike because I'm the world's worst commodity Trader and I don't want it to touch here even though 83 or above might be a better price at expiration for me I just want oil to go lower this is an omnidirectional slightly bearish trade in oil I'm going to buy the 83 call one time and I'm going to sell two of the 86 calls one by two I did this trade for a 32 Cent credit it's right there right now it's mid price when I place this trade I did have to get filled one tick under uh 32 or one tick under the mid price my mid price was 33 the mid price is 32 I would leave it in there oil's been moving around maybe you'll get filled at 32 also 32 is not 32 it's $320 in credit for the that almost $4,100 in buying power that you're using that's why you'll notice here your max profit is $3,320 because everything is 10 times what you're used to I'm long one of the 83 calls I'm short one of the 86 calls I know it says two just bear with me for a moment but if oil were to close at expiration at 86 I belong the 83 calls that would be worth $3 which is $3,000 plus the credit I received which is 32 $3,320 is your max profit on that $4,000 worth of buying power now if you were in an IRA account that buying power would be closer to $88,500 or $8,700 in buying power and please remember this buying power is subject to change remember this is not Equity options these are Futures options and they march by a different beat of the drum as you get closer to expiration and your options are closer to at the money this buying power will increase a a matter of fact will increase maybe sometimes as much as two times as much buying power so please if you make a trade like this realize that this buying power is going to change and want to have a lot of buying power on the sidelines your Theta Decay is $115 a day and this has an 89% pop high probability trade with a break even above 89 that's right your break even is 89 and change which only has about a 10% pop and about a 20% chance of a touch just rounding on both of those again $320 what's your reasonable expectation to look for risk and reward well for me I stick to the same dollar or two profit which means if I could buy this back at 22 or 12 I would make myself $200 and $100 respectfully remember your max profit $3,300 for that $4,000 of buying power to initiate this trade no risk to the downside that's why this green line goes all the way down to the bottom so if you don't think that oil is going to make new highs well this might be a trade for you but something I know you want to do regardless of your opinion on oil is open Move transfer bring your account to tasty trade the number one broker firm in the Galaxy help us keep the lights on here and also you know what help us
