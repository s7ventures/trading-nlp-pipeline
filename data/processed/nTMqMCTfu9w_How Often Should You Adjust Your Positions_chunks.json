  "How often do you adjust your positions and overall portfolio Deltas during the day? Do you do this throughout the day or just at the open and close? Typically, I make one adjustment per day, but there are days when I may make more adjustments, such as rolling down positions.",
  "In trading, it's important to stay aware of the market and make adjustments to your positions as needed. This could involve rolling down positions if the market doesn't rally as expected. It's recommended to review and make adjustments to your positions at least once a day, but potentially more if the markets are active. On average, this could be done around two times a day.",
  "I adjust my positions on the open, midday, or close, depending on the trading day. Sometimes I make two or three adjustments."
