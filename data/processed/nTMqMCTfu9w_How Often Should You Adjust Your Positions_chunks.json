  "how many times a day would you estimate that you adjust your positions and your overall portfolio Deltas do you do this throughout the day or is it just on the open and the close I anticipate never doing it happens sometimes maybe even more than than you would think when I'm making an adjustment it's typically 1.5 I would say you know usually I make one adjustment during the day it's it's enough and then you get those days uh maybe like even today where you roll down you try to play a little bit",
  "where you roll down you try to play a little bit of Market awareness here you think maybe the Market's going to Rally back a little bit and if it doesn't you roll down again and again I would say at a very minimum once a day we go through all our positions and we make adjustments if we need to I would say if the markets are active we could do that three or four times a day so on average I'm going to say two but it doesn't necessarily have to be on the open it doesn't necessarily have to be on",
  "on the open it doesn't necessarily have to be on the close a lot of times I'll do it midday on a day like today I might adjust my positions two or three times on a normal day less obviously"
