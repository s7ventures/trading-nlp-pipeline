I'm calling today's session the building the portfolio and like I said I've never done this talk before so it's brand new so you're goingon to have to bear with me um but I did write it in fact I wrote it over the last couple of weeks and this is the first of two a little bit of background on me so I spent 20 years um the first 20 years of my career out of college as a market maker on the sibo when I got out of school I don't even think I knew what what options were or what trading was but I figured it out pretty quickly and um from the early 80s like 1981 all the way till 1999 2000 I was a market maker on the floor of the Chicago Board options exchange I traded primarily in the S&P 100 which back then was called the oex at the time it was the largest S&P pit now the S&P 500 is obviously but at the time the S&P 100 was the largest pit it was about 4 or 500 people in in a very small area um and I was there from pretty much from day one so great experience and and amazing you know kind of the Last Frontier of of um like I like to say Last Frontier of Hardcore capitalism back in the 80s and 90s 1999 towards the end of that.com Boom um I built a company called thinker swim with my partner Scott Sheridan um Scott and I traded together on the floor we had built a prop trading firm um we decided to roll the dice and build thinker slim because we had been down there almost 20 years and um which turned out to be an amazing platform we were public company we were bought out by TD Merit trade in 2009 in 2011 I started tasty trade um and ta which was the digital Financial Network um in which we now call Tasty live and we started another brokerage firm which we did call Tasty works but it's now called tasty trade in 2016 it's now the largest Boutique um options and derivatives firm in the world so and we have a global pretty much a global presence now so um it's been been an amazing you know couple of decades and I've been in this business my entire career um and that's kind of you know the only reason I tell you that is because I think it's important to have some credibility and it's important to at least you know have some validation um I don't I'm not here I don't sell anything um I really just want people you know eventually to you know if they can to use our brokerage but more important than that um this is a our model is a Goodwill model we um we basically tell people everything we know and the goal is to change the world of Finance we've done a pretty good job of so far but uh there's still a lot left to do and we got to pass the torch down the road to somebody else and um that's going to be the fun part so today is the first part of building a portfolio um it's Wednesday it's 11:00 central time just a couple minutes after and it's Feb 28th part two which I've already started to write but I have not finished yet um that's how new this content is is called managing the portfolio and that is going to be the heavier of the two pieces will be part two but believe me there's plenty of stuff here in part one part two will be a month from now March 27th and again at 11 o'clock in the morning it's just for one hour um I do these two webinars so that I will set up for the live events that we'll be doing over the course of the year um we're like I said we'll be in eight different cities you can sign up at tasty.com events tasty.com events and you can sign up for any one of the Live Events everything we do is free and both of these sessions today today's session will be available able to you in about a week at the tasty.com events at the bottom of the page just scroll down and you'll be able to get um to listen to uh a repeat of it and also to get all the slides from today's show and for part two the same thing you'll be able to have all the slides from that when we do the live event later this year um throughout the country you'll be able to also get the um uh eventually get the slides from those events and so it'll be really helpful in in training and for you know educational reasons we like to call it edutainment but whatever um and on top of that later this year we're going to do a digital version of the event as well so you can have it in digital collectible like an nft fashion and again everything we're doing is free um that's the nice thing about having really good partners with the Chicago Board options exchange and the Chicago merkal Exchange um we you know we're all Chicago based so we support each other and I think it's a great thing that they've you know both those exchanges have stepped up because these events are crazy expensive um now and and you know and they're helping with the cost so it's awesome um anyway so a month from now you can sign up for the part two again tacy live.com events for everything okay so now I'm going to get into heavy stuffs like I said as we like to say grab a mitt grab your bat grab a ball get a helmet on because um there is going to be a lot of content today in the next couple of next you know 55 or 60 Minutes the key topics that I'm going to cover today our product mix starting out a little easy with stocks options um Futures and Futures options again the purpose of this doing it multi-exchange and by the way this is the first um multi-exchange content creation kind of ever this is the first collaboration of you know option exchanges and Futures exchanges um I'm product indifferent meaning I don't care what you trade um as long as you build a portfolio that's capital efficient that's why I didn't want to do something this year where we just focused on Futures just focused on stocks just focus on crypto or just focused on on options or ETFs I think it's important in 2024 that you build a portfolio and you kind of be indifferent to what the necessarily what the product is and you're more focused on the capital efficiency of those products so number one product mix number two today will be all about Capital efficiency and we're going to cover all product classes and again today is building the foundation the next session will be managing the portfolio the third part today we will talk about um portfolio allocation allocating that Capital so first we talk about the efficiency and next we talk about how to allocate the capital these are these all these topics are based on the number of emails we get 5 to 7,000 customer emails a day and from those when we sort them out and we kind of look at you know where the majority of questions come portfolio allocation Capital efficiency products and then lastly we get a lot of questions about how do you build a directional case from a professional side like there's there's obviously the retail side which has kind of long been about technical analysis and some forms of macro and there's obviously a macro side as well to this industry and to the world of Finance but there's also a quantitative side and there's also a subjective side so today we are going to cover building a directional case adding a little you know objectivity subjectivity whatever you want to call it um into building a case looking at potentially at Price looking at volatility looking at different quantitative statistical and probabilistic ways of looking at a portfol folio and then a month from now we'll talk about okay we've established a portfolio now how do we manage that portfolio and then to take this thing absolutely full circle like I said we will be in eight different cities seven in the US all Super Bowl cities and you can find all those cities on tasty.com events and we'll be in all those cities it's almost a three-hour show we do we use really cool events event centers um it will be a not like a fun fun show but it will be a heavy show so you'll bring bring your you know thinking cap on those days but we will have six different speakers to keep it interesting and they're all people that have um that work for us and they're all people that are on the network so they're all professional speakers and they really cover the educational side of this stuff um it's just exceptional the work that they do okay let's go to the next slide and we'll take you through this so again thank you everybody for coming on today if you have any questions I have a whole group of people I think Anthony Brittney Christian we have um two or three people from our trade desk in Chicago we have Britney on the tasty side if you have any questions at all because I'm I am not going to look at the chat during this talk so I can focus on the talk but if you have questions at all and you want to type something into the chat we have three people on during this webinar they can answer your questions or they can point you in the right direction whatever it is if you want to reach out to me and I am an email junkie if you want to reach out to me um you can email me at Tom tasty.com and I try to get back to you you know in the next day Tom tasty.com if you want to reach out to me I'm an email junkie okay let's do it so sit back relax and enjoy I think this is like I said first time I've done this talk I just wrote it and um I think it's a direction that we're going to be going to in the future with combination of all different products combination of all different strategies and a discussion of actually building a portfolio because active Traders are fascinated by building a portfolio so am I so we're going to start off with product mix stocks Futures and options and like I said this will get progressively harder as we finish up today and as we get into you know the next discussion um so product diversification now you've heard the term diversification a lot because everybody talks about oh diversify this diversify that we are going to cover it with in a little bit different way I don't look at diversification as just being in a couple of different stocks I look at diversification a couple different ways how are we going to utilize the um the buying power that we have in our account and how are we going to distribute that buying power and and what kind of Leverage are we looking for like if we were to compare the amount of money we're using to a notional equivalent if we were comparing the amount of money we're using to buying power reduction the cool thing about trading in 2024 is that back of the envelope you can generally use buying power reduction as a very effective mechanism for managing Capital versus your net lick and for managing Capital versus your risk so for starters here and again this is not going to look like your typical portfolio this is this is a portfolio building a portfolio for active Traders um so and and this breaks down something somewhat similar to what our breakdown is at our brokerage firm so at tasty trade just to give you an idea so I give you a little context around this our business breaks down to about just under 80% options about 10% Futures about 10% Futures options small percent cash small small per in digital assets but that's kind of the primary you know that's our primary business model now when I look at building a portfolio I'm fairly similar to that about 20% of my active portfolio is would be considered in equities underlying stocks why would you use stocks in an active trading account when they're not as effective tool for buying power well one the underlying might not be liquid enough not to use stock I mean it might not have liquid derivatives there could be other reasons why you know the markets may be tighter in the stock market there's a couple of different reasons why You' use stocks you could be making adjustments to your positions so lots of different reasons but stocks about 20% of buying power Futures and Futures options tend to be for me around 20% of buying power now when I say Futures and Futures options it's because I'm relatively indifferent to Futures and or Futures options I would say for the most part a lot of our positions are Futures options but but we do do a bunch of like for example pairs trading which is just which is just one future two highly correlated Futures one long and one short or two highly correlated Futures that offset each other and you're betting on a either a contraction or additional Divergence from where it's currently trading so Futures and Futures options about 20% of buying power now remember Futures are also more leveraged than stocks and they're more leveraged than op options so that 20% is a very understated number options about 50% we say options that's a combination of ETF options of listed Equity options and of obviously of index options and that the combination of those different option markets changes or or different option positions changes based on what's happening in the market for example right now with the stock market at record highs the index volume other than on the zeros the index volumes dropped down a little bit and the equity volumes picked up a little bit for most people with positions because Equity options have generally higher volatility right now than the index option positions but that can rotate and fluctuate based on how the markets move and then we always keep a certain amount of cash now when we talk about cash we're going to invest probably a less much less than 90% but cash maybe in the 10% range these are kind of these are kind of generalized allocations but just to give you an idea of where we start and what our thinking is we're thinking 20% stocks 20% Futures and Futures options and 20% listed option strategies these are not just long options or just short options these are strategies some defined risk some undefined risk and then obviously a cash position on top of that so the next thing we think about is well we put all these positions together together what does it mean and how do we how do we Mo how do we watch it how do we monitor it how do we know we have on okay we can we understand through buying power exactly how much Capital we're using so through buying power we can also learn to measure risk it's one of the skill sets you develop as you become an active Trader and as you get you know deeper deeper into um kind of what we call kind of more of like active management but what's most important is really understanding what do you have on and so how do you figure that out well first of all we we we default everything to what we call beta weighted Deltas which means that we essentially take our position and in order to compare you know an IBM position to an Nvidia position to a soybean position to a bond position to an S&P position we have to convert everything so we can generally convert everything into SP y Deltas that's what we call beta weighted Deltas that's just essentially taking the beta waiting of each underlying converting it to spy so that everything is Apples to Apples that makes it that simplifies EV that's generally simplifies everything in 2024 almost every platform has beta weighted Deltas we first introduced this in 2001 and since then every platform has picked this up and that's a great thing you need to have that understanding how non-correlated underlyings are defined is important so we put here as a list on the right hand side of the page and what you can see first at the top is es those are the S&P 500 futures everything is beta weighted towards the spy and the Spy is the same thing as es we'll talk about the the measurements later but for for for argument sake over beta weighting if you're beta weighted to the Spy you're beta weighted to the es and you can see right below that is the NASDAQ future right below that rty is the Russell future and then we start to talk about things that are not correlated so bonds are not correlated to stocks the first three at the top are stocks the next one bonds gold crude oil and natural gas none of those those are all wrapped around zero any correlation below 0.5 is essentially what we would call close enough to being not correlated wrapped around zero has no correlation so that what that means is if the stock market goes up it doesn't mean bonds are going up or down if the stock market goes up it doesn't mean gold is going up or down if gold goes up or down it doesn't mean that crud all is going to do something so by doing this essentially what you've done and the last one on there which is n which is um which is which is the Euro 6E which is the euro is another underlying that we feel is not correlated now why is this important because it does two crazy things to a portfolio and and we're not talking about having just snps NASDAQ also any of those things on there's lots of ETF equivalents like the ETF equivalent to Nasdaq futures are the q's the ETF equivalent to rty is iwm the ETF equivalent to ZB is TLT the ETF equivalent to GC is GLD the ETF equivalent to NG is UN and the you know you can find different different ones for currencies but they're not as effective but this one be fxe what's important about this from a discussion standpoint point for portfolio reasons is if you have a portfolio that is not correlated you are going to have a huge reduction in portfolio volatility it actually comes out to about 35% so you're going to have a 35% across theboard reduction in portfolio volatility that's the swings that you take so if you're uncomfortable with a $100 swing or a ,000 swing or a $10,000 swing what B based on the size of your portfolio and based on the type of positions have on the way to reduce that by 35% which is very significant is to have a portfolio that's where the underlings are not correlated how do you do that well you introduce Futures and Futures options side by side with stock and stock options again this is a discussion about product indifference we're agnostic to what we trade we're just looking for opportunity but not only does it reduce portfolio volatility it also reduces out outlier risk so an outlier risk is the stuff you can't control so what happens is do you still have outlier risk of course they're still but what it does is it reduces over 90% of your outlier risk now I know that sounds crazy but you're thinking how do you reduce 90% of outlier risk well by having a portfolio of truly non-correlated underlyings what you end up doing based on Capital allocation is you end up staying smaller and by staying smaller you essentially reduce about 90 % of your outlier risk so the first we're only two slides in and already what we've discussed is creating a diversified portfolio using lots of different underlyings and in the process of that reducing the portfolio volatility that's your intraday swings and your overnight swings and then virtually eliminating most of the outlier risk because you've reduced the size of your positions and you've Diversified your portfolio now I'm going to keep going at a I'm going to pick up the pace a little bit here so I just want you to be kind of you know uh hang in there with me because it's I I I get that this gets a little heavy but and if you're new if you've been around us have been around tasty for a while some of this will be hey piece of cake I got this but if you're completely new to this and this is your first time I know it's a little heavy and again you can email me Tom tasty.com or you can study this or come to one of the Live Events I I strongly urge you to sign up for Live Events they will all be full they will all be basically full and sold out before we do them but if you sign up early there's tons of room right now okay we just listed them correlation so we're going to stay on this topic for a second by including non-correlated assets into your portfolio the total volatility of portfolio be will be closer to the lowest volatility asset even though those assets are equally weighted see that's really cool that's that 30% reduction so what ends up happening and you can kind of see we put the volatility reducing numbers and how much we basically you know plus or minus what happens like when you look at the daily volatility of the snps let's just say it's plus or minus 1% or plus orus 1.2% and a bond portfolio is Plus or minus. 7 well when you put those together okay and you do 50 half and half you drop the whole portfolio volatility down to 72 and that is the beauty of and just think that's just two that's just two underlyings that's just breaking it apart and and most people are like well I don't want to have I'll give you some examples I don't want to put um Bitcoin I don't want to put eth into my portfolio I don't want to put digital Assets in there I don't want to do this that because the volatility is too high it is too high in some cases as a standalone but it's not too high when you diversify your portfolio and that way you might on the one hand have something with a really low implied volatility like the Euro at you know seven or 8% volatility and then you'll have a 45 to 55% % volatility like Bitcoin or you'll have a 45% volatility like Nvidia and a you know and a much smaller one like a 25% volatility like apple once you start doing that or using you know one of the ETFs like you might use the snps or iwm and then all of a sudden you have a low volatility there and you combine that with a higher volatility something like natural gas and all of a sudden you are in a portfolio where you've reduced the volatility down to the lowest common denominator and that's super cool and that really helps to to again reduce your outlier risk and to reduce your intraday swings so the next thing we're going to talk about we're going to look about we're gonna we're going to really focus on dissecting the optimal Decay curve so I'm a premium seller which means I like to sell options more than I like to buy options or I like to sell spreads more than I like to buy spreads you can do it either way I'm not everything is fairly priced in the world of options whether they're future options or whether they're um listed Equity options the whole world of options is as long as you're trading a liquid product everything is priced to Perfection there's no Edge there's no Edge there's no theoretical Edge in buying or selling something there's no theoretical Edge in buying or selling a listed option there's no theoretical Edge in buying selling or Futures option they're all priced to Perfection so so what do you do you stay in liquid underlyings you make sure they're Diversified but you live in what we call there's no theoretical Edge but we believe there's a mechanical there's a me there's you can optimize the mechanics so how do you optimize the mechanics well you stay in the optimal point in the Decay curve so I'm going to explain now the advantages of for example managing a portfolio early which which again we're going to get into great detail on the next webinar but managing portfolio early reduces the volatility and it also reduces outlier risk so you're starting to get the hang of what we're trying to do here which is when we build a portfolio we want to reduce the volatility of that portfolio because we know Hey listen this is an active trading portfolio this is not a passive set it and forget it this is not hey wake up in 20 years and see how we did this is an active trading portfolio where you get to it you know you're you're on it every single day or when as much as you can be or multiple times a day and again you're reducing outlier risk also we can show you that by adding duration you know going you know longer than let's say 20 days longer than 30 days longer than 40 days or potentially longer than 50 or 60 days you can increase optionality and provide more time to be right we're usually always all right we're all right eventually it's just the timing sucks our timing isn't that good nobody's timing is that good when it comes to markets it's really hard so a lot of times buying duration being able to extend duration does two things it gives you more time to be right and it also synthetically increases the volatility of the underlying so means on a low volatility underline you actually create a little more premium for yourself also different durations allow for different strategic opportunities and again provide more diversification to the portfolio you can diversify by underlying but you can also diversify by strategy you can also diversify by implied volatility you can also diversify by duration so what I have here is a slide that shows this is this is 45 days to expiration um you can see where it says 45 DTE that's 45 days to expiration and then you can see expiration and what we've done here is we've put an average running p&l plac 45 days to expiration now what most people don't realize when I talked about I want you to be at the optimal point in the Decay curve the optimal point in the Decay curve well 75% of the money you're going to make when you trade is in that optimal point in the Decay curve from the first 24 days the last 21 days you make one quarter of the month even though it has the fastest rate of decay in the first 24 days with the slowest rate of Decay it's actually called the optimal point in DEC curve because that's where you make the most money most people think it's the other way around that's what's so fascinating about this slide and and this Slide the first time people see it they're like wow that kind of freaks me out but it freaked me out because I was doing it wrong for about 20 years so how do we calculate expected move because what is volatility volatility and we base a lot of stuff that we do on volatility but what is volatility so volatility is essentially it's another word for expected move it's volatility tells us and measures how much is this underlying going to move based on the efficient markets that are that we're looking at essentially it's the cleanest it's the cleanest calculation we have as the best guesstimate as the best approximation for what's about to happen basically everything that is known about that underlying is built into that expected move number so why is knowing the expected move so important because if you know what the expected move is you have context around where to set up your short strikes and where to set up your um an expectation for getting out of that position like let's say you bought let's say you bought a stock XYZ and you bought it for1 and you're like where should I sell this stock and and you have no idea right because how would you know but if you know what the expected move is for the next 45 days and let's say the expected move is $11 now all of a sudden you have a reasonable number because 68% of the time that is the number that's going to be hit so all of a sudden now you have a you have context around where is an where is a good exit Place where's a good exit point and the other side to that is you also know let's say you want to sell let's say you want to buy stock and sell a call there or you wanted to let's say you wanted to get short a naked put in order to get long stock for your portfolio these are all strategies that we're going to cover in the next webinar but let's say you want to do that knowing the expected move is the most important thing you can do that's why we fa we focus everything on tasty around expected move is the Delta of an option an accurate measure of expected move and the answer is of course it's as close as we can get without actually just breaking down the math behind it so can you use back of the envelope Delta as an approximate measure of expected move and the answer is sure how do professionals use expected move and how do professionals use Delta and the answer is they're interchangeable they essentially use Delta as expected move and expected move as Delta and and if you think hey you know what that's kind of C that's all we ever did to figure out you know to figure out what are the chances of this trade working it was always well what's the Delta and that's the beauty of understanding expected move it's not that complicated this is a this is a nuanced knowhow industry meaning there's there's the the challenge everybody that's on this chat there's you know over 700 people on this chat I think there's going to be like five or 10 thousand that listen to it probably within a week or so the the the beauty of this stuff is that every single person person participating today is crazy smart but a lot of this stuff has to do with Nuance knowhow there's a lot of little nuances about Finance in the Futures world in the Futures options world in the listed Equity world in the listed option world in the index ETF world that's what I'm trying to get across this is what we call optimizing the mechanics and optimizing the Nuance knowhow that's how professionals use expected move it's interchangeable with Delta what does that mean that gives you a reasonable expectation it gives you context it gives you probability of profit so on the tasty platform and I can't speak for other platforms but we have built other platforms um we will show expected move and it's right in parenthesis so for example this is the SPX and for the zeros the ones the twos and the five days you can see what the expected move is here that's all it is it's that crazy simple most platforms just listed there's not even anything you have to figure out out if you need to figure something out I mean generally you can use you can use if you have a if you have a volatility index that's around let's just say 19% the expected move is about 1% for that day and it's interchangeable among Commodities commodity options um Equity options everything else completely it's it's all interchangeable so I'm going to proceed now to Capital efficiency across product classes now again you can see I'm going fast I have to go fast I built so much content to this day I don't even know if we're going to get to it by the end of the you know by the end of the next 25 minutes so I I really got to power through it but there are three people on answering questions um you know nothing nothing is off limits and if you have any questions later on after this event you can email me again at Tom tasty.com and that's if you came on late and again this event will be available to you in one week on tasty.com events scroll to the bottom of the page and you'll be able to find the archives of this event and the next we're going to do and all the live events that we're doing all over the country and in London but please sign up early because they get packed okay Capital efficiency of all product classes hold on one second let me see perfect so we are going to compare um Apples to Apples here like I talked about earlier that's the beauty of beta waiting but it's also the beauty of buying power reduction now there's here here's trading in 2024 is very different than it was trading 20 30 40 years ago everything is based on available capital and buying power reduction and everything on today's modern platforms modern technology which is amazing is all done on the back end so you don't have to worry about different regulatory bodies you don't have to worry about different margining systems you don't have to worry about any of that stuff what's important to know is that that if you have a regular margin account everything we're discussing today is a regular margin account some people have portfolio margin reduce everything by thir a third some people have if you if you have if you're just trading for example um futures or Futures options you're going to use about a third less Capital but I strongly recommend using everything and if you're just trading equities or Equity options I strongly recommend in in including Futures if you're at a brokerage firm that doesn't support all this stuff change your firm because you should have an opportunity like you want to walk into a casino you don't want them to tell you you can't play blackj or you can't play craps that's ridiculous everything is the same everything is theoretically perfect and you know you should have the advantages of the best product choices and the best buying power reduction and capital efficiency so we're going to work on the nuances and importance of a capital efficient strategy because the best way to reduce risk in the world of active trading is to reduce your size to manage early and to do as many types of diversification as possible also I'm going to talk about the impact of static and dynamic hedging static hedging just so you understand the terminology is if I used stock or Futures against an option position Dynamic hedging is if I used options against an option position and how Dynamic hedging and static hedging are different with respect to adjustments and buying power for example if I if I have an option position on and I use stock it's going to be expensive to use stock if I have an option position on and I use Futures it's going to be about six times I'm going to get six times more leverage using Futures than I would using stock but stock may be more of a perfect hedge than the Futures so you have to make that determination do I want to use one6 the amount of capital or do I want the perfect tedge and then when you're adjusting options with options you might find hey I can do this without putting up any additional Capital that's a dynamic hedge so there's all those different choices and you have to be able to make them but make them instantaneously the whole key here is speed not because you're competing with anybody but just because you don't want to overthink this stuff you want your brain to process this and to know what your next move is before like you even open up a quote screen you're going to know exactly what you want to do my goal here is to get you to think like a couple of steps ahead so that you know what you're going to do to adjust a bad position and a good position is easy a bad position is hard and so when something starts to go against you I want you to know the most efficient effective most efficient and capital effective way to adjust that position and to give you the best chance to turn it around bring it back to even turn it to profitability whatever it is so the other last thing we're going to focus on here is capital efficiency and the law of large numbers you know if you do something one time it's it's really it's really random what the results are going to be so in order for this whole process today and everything we're discussing to be successful you have got to do this a lot meaning we're just playing the game of law of large numbers I'm going to show you some statistics in a second but if you do something once twice or 10 times you know what it's it's really just very random whether it works or not if you do something consistent and you're mechanical about it law of large numbers takes over and whether you want it to work you don't want it to work it's going to work basically just the same way as the the same way as the probabilities suggest it will so now we start getting into some kind of and and I promise you this is not too heavy it's just new for some people so just bear with me and there'll be plenty of time to go over this and again that's why we do the live show that's why we spend three hours on just part of this content the importance of Leverage in a in and leverage the importance of Leverage and derivatives in a modern portfolio is basically to give you the ability for an outsized return using less Capital now why do I want an outsized return using less capital and the answer is because if you are going to manage your portfolio yourself and you are going to put the time and resources into active management you have got to at least have an opportunity to make some multiple of a risk-free return if you have if risk-free returns right now or let's just say is 5% then there's no way you want to manage an active portfolio with the objective of making seven or eight% you're going to manage an active portfolio with the objective of making two three four five six times what you would make on a risk-free on a risk-free portfolio that's up to you some people are happy with 2x some you're happy with 3x some happy with 6X that's on you but from my my position here is I want to show you that that option or that optionality is available to you so what we did on the right hand side of the pages we talked about theoretical example for a stock trading at $100 and just so you can look at 100 shares of a stock trading $100 is $10,000 in capital required if you just did that without margin so you can borrow up to 50% but the pop which is the probability of profit is 50/50 so then you go by a long call which is in this case on the same $1 stock and you're buying the the 30 days expiration the 50 Delta long call it's costing you $360 but your pop is only 35% to get over your break even but your cap reduction is 96% is that a good trade I don't know but in the last trade on the bottom which is the 30-day expiration the 50 Delta short put all of a sudden I've taken my probability profit from 35 to 65 I've actually it's the inverse my buying power went up to 2,300 which is still 75% less than the stock stock but my probability of profit is I'm sorry but my cap reduction is 77% so my pop is 65% my cap reduction is 77% and my buying power which is the reduction is only $2,300 now again to each their own I understand that the long call has has limited risk and the short put has unlimited risk below you know below whatever credit you receive but it's still less risk than the 100 shares of stock and it has and it has a 15% more higher probability of profit and it has a 77% Capital reduction this is just really basic stuff we get heavier so then we go and we start to talk about improving your basis so this is the key to active trading to to building an active trading portfolio it's all about basis reduction what does basis reduction mean basis reduction means if I have this iPhone here which hopefully you can see but if I have an iPhone and this iPhone costs $1,000 how do I buy it for $ 800 okay that's what we call basis reduction how do I reduce the cost basis of that iPhone by a certain amount of money so and then you have to talk about the trade-off between your probability of profit your potentially lower profits and how do you deal with that so the first thing is we talked about hey here's a $100 stock right and it capital required for that is $10,000 the p&l after it rallies to $ 105 is $500 you make make Five Points it's $500 if you bought the longan call for $363 and we close there you know 30 days from now you make $137 so your return on capital is 38% compared to 5% on 100 Shar of stock but on the short put okay um using less buying power on a rally you're going to make $322 which is a 14 % return on Capital but you make almost three times or two and a half times as much money as you make on the long call and almost as much money as you make on the stock but your return on capital is 3x I'm focused not so much on return on Capital but I'm focused on on getting people to understand how important reducing basis is because remember on that short put you have a 65% probability of profit compared to the long stock which has a 50% probability of profit and also that 105 number came from the expected move so that's all about the expected move it's really fascinating when you start to put all this stuff together in your portfolio construction so I'm covering here improving pop improving your probability of profit how do you improve probability of profit without adding more capital you can roll the position you can reenter the position are Delta and pop interchangeable well sometimes sometimes Delta and pop are exactly the same sometimes they're generally interchangeable but sometimes they're you know they we can we can create some different situations and learn how to raise your total portfolio probability of profit one of the things that we want to focus on today's discussion is I want people to understand that you should not be in a portfolio that has a 50/50 probability of profit you should be in a portfolio where your probability of profit is much closer on the whole portfolio between 65 67 or 72% I want you to be in that 65 to 72% probability of profit range so here's a fun little slide I put together um for for you guys today you can see when your Delta is lower your pop is going to be higher meaning if you sell a 22 Delta call or a 22 Delta put whatever it is or or or an iron Condor or a call spread or put spread at the lower Delta you're going to have a much higher probability of profit but your returns are going to be lower so you you can anybody can generate a 95 or 98% chance of profit on anything but you don't necessarily want to do that because you want to have a very fair tradeoff between your max return as a your max return as a percentage of your buying power so where is the perfect number is it a 22 Delta is a 27 Delta is it a 33 Delta you know so that's a decision you have to make but the nice thing about this slide is it gives you some context around how how you make that decision so again I'm going to keep pushing forward here and I know I packed a lot into this webinar but I don't like you know it's important to me I I never want to waste anybody's time I know how valuable time is I know how valuable resources is so I will never dumb anything down and I will push as much stuff as I can into a presentation and then later on we can dissect it later on we'll we'll do it live we will break this stuff apart if it takes hours days months whatever so total Capital use is a percent of account value this is one of the I'm going to put two or three stars on this page because this is one of the most difficult things for individual investors how do you understand how do you learn sensible Capital allocations based on various vola levels do you know the number one cause of Traders blowing out the number one cause of of bad trading number one there's nothing else even close to it one thing stands out there stands out Head and Shoulders above everything else it's size it's the wrong Capital allocation you can get away with a lot of other mistakes you can get away with some bad diversification you can get away with sometimes not being not having enough not being too highly correlated you can get away with you know maybe using too many of the same strategies you can get away with a couple different things you can get away with not optimizing your mechanics but you can never Escape um the wrong sizing that is that is it once you once you get two big size kills it's we like to say when genius fails it's always about size so how do you use different product strategies and correlations to assist and capital location and does account size and investment objectives play a role and you bet they do so this is an old slide this is the most conservative case we've ever put together if the vix is between 10 and 15 like it is now the total portfolio buying power uses as a percent of net lick would be very low in the most conservative case 25% in the most in in the moderate case 35% in the aggressive case 45 to 50% and let's just say this is between $50 and $100,000 count if it's a million doll count it's a little lower if it's A1 count it's a little higher but this is the most conservative case so vixs at 40 plus on on on an average size account of let's call it 50,000 50% on moderate case 65% on the aggressive case 75 to 80% with the vix over 40 which only happens five you know five times every two or three decades but we easily can see vix between 15 and 30 for almost 30% of the time and in that case we're talking about 32 47 60 in those ranges okay so that's the capital allocation based on where the vix is it's a very simple way to do it so but let's talk trade size because this is what freaks people out most people they start out trading too big believe me I wish the problem was people traded too small first of all on your platform always set your default size to the smallest possible number for you so if your average trade size is 10 contracts set it to five if your average future size is five contracts or two contracts set it to one and then adjust upwards so percentage allocation on a per trade on a per trade and per underlying basis so what we're doing now is we're talking about trade size versus buying power it's always about units the fewer units you can be long or short and the more you can credit you can create for yourself is always best so you always default to fewer units not necessarily less risk we default to more risk fewer units that's our that's our kind of the way we look at things so if you want to and there's one typo here for Define RIS oh I'm sorry for I I take it back it's not typo for Define risk the position could be as small as3 or 0.5 but we would never allocate more than 5% to a defined risk trade for an undefined risk trade the lowest on a big account could be like I don't know a little less than 1% and the highest on a small account could be about 15% but we never like to see it be more than 10 to 15% in a single underlying and on undefined risk and we never like to see it be more than let's call it a half a percent to 3% maybe Max on a small count 5% of defined risk you have to be very careful like you don't want to do you know 50 spreads for um let's just say 50s verse two contracts for $5 like you just don't want those extra units so you'd rather take the more risk and the fewer units so you have to learn that that is one of the challenges that's one of the nuances of trading and then you also have to learn between listed options and Futures options because Futures Options under span margining give you more leverage and much more flexibility and again I'm going to use this word for the third time more optionality Futures options are the most coste effective in the world because you don't even have to put up full risk but over time the capital requirements change on Futures options which is something you're not used to on listed options either way you have to learn to adjust for futures and Futures options you're going to be about a third less than for listed Equity options but these numbers here of the half a percent to let's call it 3% for defined risk Max case 5 and for undefined risk anywhere from 1% to 3 to 7% Max case 15 depending on size of the account just keep your allocations small keep your contract size small increase your risk reduce your contract size always think about that so in addition to that another take away from earlier is manage early keep stay small and it flows right into this manage early stay small manage manage early and keep your Capital allocation small keep your contract size small it's the most effective way to manage risk people use stop orders and think that that's managing risk that is essentially just as bad as just as bad as allocating too much Capital to a trade you are far far better off keeping your size small and managing risk that way so let's talk about using buy Power as a measure of risk a lot of people will look at um they'll look at risk graphs they'll look at kind of worst case they'll look at they'll look get Deltas um uh one of the really effective tools back of the envelope tools for managing risk is to use buying power reduction if you lose use buying power reduction on a trade essentially you know we own a brokerage firm and the brokerage firm uses buying power reduction as an effective tool for measuring risk and we have customers with you know millions of positions on on an individual basis back of the envelope if you want to compare apples to apples use buying power reduction as a very effective tool for managing risk it's a cheat sheet way of doing it but it works and it's actually perfect and it's the same way that professionals operate professional Traders not Floor Traders um and the reason for that is because buying power reduction is an effective tool for measuring risk and it allows you to compare product a to product B to product C to product D to product e okay having a bunch of positions on Is Not a Bad Thing having small Diversified positions is really a good thing so the short put um short put or call buying power is and we just put the formula down here I don't have to read it off to you but that's how you figure it out the way the way the back of the envelope way to figure out buying power on a short call or short putut is just essentially say it's a little less than 20% of wherever the strike is that's the simplest way to do it so you have to figure it out and on the future side you can most cases it will be anywhere from a quarter of that number it's around a quarter of that number could be it could be a quarter to um let's just say a quarter keep it simple so then it comes down to okay well I've created these positions Tom but what is my portfolio probability of profit some platforms show it we show it some platforms don't whatever but what is the portfolio and how reliable is that do I have to figure it out manually is it on the platform whatever the answer is it's pretty damn good but again if it relies on law of large numbers your portfolio pop has it's it is very dependent on law of large numbers meaning that if you do something on a very random basis your results are going to be very random if you do something on a very mechanical basis your results are going to come very close to whatever your expectations are is there an optimal Target for probability of profit to aim for on a total portfolio and like I told you before yes 65 to 72 how percent how many occurrences or trades do you need to predict your portfolios pop accurately for L of large numbers to kick in and this is this is an interesting question and again this is for today's audience only because you are active Traders you're listening to me you know on a Wednesday midday this is what we do this is our own small little crazy world you know I get this we're all junkies and so the answer is we're trading junkies and the answer here is that um I would say and I'm going to probably you know I don't want to scare the children minimum of two trades a day that comes out to about five or 600 trades a year I would say average is somewhere in the neighborhood of a, to 1500 and I would say that average could easily be 5 or 10,000 if it if you wanted to it wouldn't it wouldn't even I wouldn't blink an eye at it but at a minimum about you know five to six 00 which is twoa 250 trading days it's two trades it's just adjustments those that's not two opening trades that could be one closing trade one adjustment you might not make an opening trade for three to five for five days it's just adjustments and but on average it's higher than that the average tasty Trader it's about 1,200 trades a year that kind of thing let's go to the oh sorry next slide and here's what's kind of important about this you can see here how the numbers smooth out towards whatever the expectation is if you're only make 10 trades you know what your win rate looks pretty damn good at 70% Your standard deviation which is the amount of fluctuation looks pretty damn good but you know you don't know what that is and then but it's still a very random number and the p&l per trade wow that's huge so it worked out in this case because it's random but if you go down to kind of all trades which is a true me or a thousand trades you'll see that your standard deviation goes way down and your win rate goes way up and so the more times you do something it's not that you get better at it it's just you take out that those random outliers and everything gets flattened around the curve and that's what you want in order to be successful what do you have to do to be a successful Trader you have to learn to scale and make things repeatable and in order to do that or in order for that to happen you have to do things a lot of times and that's essentially what we're saying here now I'm a few minutes over so I apologize I started a couple minutes late and again I've never done this particular webinar before so I'm going to go a few minutes over by about five minutes so just bear with me please hang in there because this is this is good stuff too and again I started a couple minutes late I'm try to be on time um but this is my first time and I packed too much information in this one today but nobody ever it's nobody's it's it's free and and nobody ever complained about getting too much so here we go last last part building a directional case this is about opportunity because there's lots of different ways to look at Market Direction sometimes we are all non-directional and non-directional or delta neutral is a directional play so so that's I mean as simply as I could say it Delta neutrality is considered a directional play is price capitulation measurable and is it accurate well it's not measurable it's subjective is it accurate No it's a contrarian play but is it something that a lot of us use of course we assume price capitulation we think Market have topped out we assume price capitulation we think Mark markets have bottomed out is there anything wrong with that of course not can volatility predict future price and the answer is no all volatility can predict is future contraction or expansion because volatility has mean reverting qualities can option pricing skew be used to help pick Market Direction This is what tons of people ask us if the puts are more expensive than the calls are we going down if the calls are more expensive than the puts are we going up no no it cannot be used to pick Market Direction pricing skew is used really to show you where the market perceives the velocity of risk to be it has nothing to do with Market direction that is a very popular misconception so how accurate are those beta weighted Deltas that we talked about to start this discussion and the answer is as good as anything in this entire world in other words as good as any as good as any measure can be of anything this is the largest Marketplace it's better than a line on the Super Bowl it's better than any bet you're ever going to make as far as accuracy because there is way more money here do liquidity and correlation impact the beta weighted accuracy and of course they do the more liquid the underlying is the more efficient the markets are and the better your your numbers are going to be does correlation impact it of course it does because again if you want the most accurate situation you want the most liquid underlyings and liquidity leads to efficiency leads to accuracy is it best to hedge beta weighted Deltas with indexes or individual stocks or Futures let's be fair here could should I use Futures should I use an index should I use an individual stock that is 100% up to you if I'm trading crude oil and I'm trading crude oil options I like to use other crude oil options to hedge it if I'm trading if I'm Trading um Nvidia I like to use Nvidia options to hedge my Nvidia position if I'm buying or selling let's just say as an example I'm long the Japanese Yen and I want to hedge that position I will sell a Japanese Yen call against it if I have a big position on of options beta wage the spy and and I find myself let's just say short 2,000 deltas and I want to reduce my Risk by a th000 Deltas I will use S&P futures or I will use spies it doesn't matter I'm indifferent to those I'll sell if I'm long a thousand or I'm sorry if I'm short 2,000 Deltas I'll buy two S&P futures es futures or I'll buy a th000 shares of stock or I'll use let's just let's just say I'll use a couple of at the money um spy calls or or long spy calls or short spy puts so I am indifferent to what those Hedges are I tend to use Dynamic Hedges I tend to use the individual underlying but sometimes we use Futures sometimes we use indexes and it's really up to the individual just know that all those choices are available to you so again if you're new to all this stuff we're talking Delta we're talking Theta we're talking all this kind of crazy stuff and which is you know I put the the definition of delta on the right hand side here it's the change in an options price given a $1 increase in the underlying price and Theta is the sensitivity of an options price to changes in time speed which I'm sorry the the amount of Premium that you're collecting gamma is the speed at which it happens but in order of importance which contributes more to your p&l Delta or Theta well I hope it's Theta sometimes it could be Delta if you're delta neutral it's Theta if you're directional it's I'm sorry if your delta neutral is Theta if you're directional is Delta what are reasonable guidelines for portfolio Theta well you've got to be careful here because you do not want to be too big remember that's when genius fails so reason guidelines for portfolio Theta are to stay small usually my number is 1/10th to 3/10 of a percent based on your net lick again I'll repeat that what's a reasonable guideline for daily Theta one1 to 3/10 of your net lick is and everything we talk about today is based off net lick even buying power reduction and is it possible to manage Delta risk based on notional equivalent and the answer is of course it's possible it's just not that efficient today you're better off managing your Delta risk um essentially against your net lick or against your Theta numbers notional equivalency gets to be a little complicated and measuring risk through beta weighting okay so how oops I'm sorry I just did this let me just go through this here it is um is there such a thing as a product expert anymore and the answer is no I mean there's there's experts in the industry of course that can talk about you know different macro things and can and can give you second derivative um Greeks and and all that kind of stuff but there's no such thing as I'm a Futures Trader I'm a a stock Trader I'm an option Trader you're an everything Trader markets are markets this an auction Marketplace it's an efficient Marketplace okay it's a true Frontier of capitalism it's works okay just you you have to trust that theoretical pricing and efficient markets actually work is strategy diversification just as important as product diversification and the answer is it absolutely is and liquidity is as important to product indifference is liquidity and product indifference are as important to all this stuff as anything else as far as account type it and account size they do play a role you have to have a margin account obviously it's impossible to do this stuff in a cash account can you do this stuff in an IRA account yes is it a little harder sure can you pay somebody else to do this for you the answer is no not really and does account size play a role of course I mean the larger account you have um the the more flexibility you have the more different things you can trade but it is what it is like different people have different amounts of money and and we respect that and if you're a different point in your life you know if I was doing this 30 years ago I would be at a different point in my life than I am today so of course all that stuff plays a role
