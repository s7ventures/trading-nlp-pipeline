welcome to option trades today I'm Tony the Baptist and I have a trade idea for you today November 5th 2024 it's election day but first let's see what's going on with the market well let me tell you something &ps are having quite a day they are quite strong &ps are up $49.50 NASDAQ up 209 they're both just off of their highs Russell up 17 and change and the Dow Up 3 00 it's an allout rally in the market volatility down by 107 giving a lot of support to this rally in the market uh volatility down $5 uh sorry down five and a half% down a dollar five right now bonds continue to be weaker down by 15 as bonds go lower rates go higher and the FED is supposed to come out tomorrow and talk about well reducing interest rates I don't know how they're going do that in this market that we have something's got to give you MEPS have to go lower or bonds have to go higher but this can't stay right now the way things have been going but all that means nothing to me because I'm going to go into the equity world I like to go to the high option volume list and I like to click on my earnings so I have no earnings on the right hand side here I don't want to trade any of those stocks that have earnings for me I like to avoid these stocks that have earnings a stock that came came up to me would be Tesla Tesla sitting here with an ivy rank of 44 let's find it on my list here you'll see that Tesla up $866 today leading the NASDAQ higher is trading at $251 it's had a decent range today of almost $7 but look at this the ivx 5day change that's the implied volatility of the options over the last 5 days has been rallying as volatility has been going lower with an ivvy rank of 44 and no earnings great markets this is a stock that just calls my name what are we going to do in here well I'm going to go nice and wide in here I'm going to go far out to the outer reaches I'm going to go to December options with 45 days 45 days being optimal at least from our research on opening trades I'm going to go to December again earning are not until January 22nd this is a post earnings trade they've already had their earnings I'm going to go all the way down to the 200 put the 200 put with a 10 Delta is trading around $260 I'm going to go all the way up to the 335 calls again approximately the same Delta I could go to the 330s you certainly could I just happened to go to the to the 335s when I looked at this trade that was the 10 Delta option it gives me basically no Delta but as you can see one long Delta here my probability of profit is 83% my Theta Decay how much should this go down all things being equal if that volatility does not expand per day about $19 a day my Max profit is the credit I received $465 and you can do this better than me because I did it at 400 and $61 uh your max loss they say is infinite but look at these dotted lines this is the one standard deviation line just above 300 and this is the one standard Dev deviation line uh just below 205 I'm outside of one standard deviation that's why my probably a profit even though I'm selling both sides is 83% the buying power effect is $5,000 on almost almost $465 if you get filled at Mid price here or even if you get filled on the bid at 462 or 463 I did it at 461 let's take a look at this your break evens are just above 195 and your break even is just below 340 let's see over the last 45 days has has Tesla been any higher than that no it has not has it been any lower than that no it has not so I'm outside the expected move I'm outside the recent range all I want Tesla to do is cooperate and by cooperate I want it to have its $35 expected move over the next 45 days I am well outside of that range this is a relatively um high probability trade but of course there's always the risk of the stock moving higher or lower and changing my overall Delta so what would I want to do well every time this Delta right here gets to plus or minus 15 I roll down the untested side meaning if I was getting positive 15 Delta meaning the stock was going lower I would move this call down until I increased my short Delta by seven or eight meaning that I would have only seven or eight long Deltas left with the stock going higher I remove I remove the Delta risk when my Delta gets to plus or minus 15 right here on the screen or on your position tab hey it's an advantage that you're watching this video now because like I told you a moment ago if you go to um these lines right here and you go to the follow page you can see that Bob the trader that's me I put on this trade at 10:09 this morning with the stock at five $250. 70 it's it's now $252 with an 83% Pop I did it at $461 you can do it higher right now it's a wide Pro post earning strangle in an high IV uh High ivr stock that's definitely in the news but that's my trade for you today a classic strangle we'll see what the market brings us the next day or two as they unwind or come about these earnings of these election results and then we'll be able to
