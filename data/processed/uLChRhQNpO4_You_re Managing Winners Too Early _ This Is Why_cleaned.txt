so yeah this one's going to speed of profits so this is really look g delving into the idea of if we choose different profit targets how long do we wind up having to stay into trades and so right how much are we giving up in terms of Time Versus money right this is sort of a constant tradeoff in our in our approach and are just getting some numbers around it I'm looking at it so right our our general approach to retail option trading is that we want to sell premium and then manage winners that's sort of our our most bread and butter technique around here um and then this raises the question about how patient do you want to be on your winners right where where do you want to set that line and I think for a long time you know for for a lot of years we just seted 50% on every trade no matter what and and walked away from it and then we got into zeros like a little you know almost two years ago now and we discovered that on zeros 50% was too high of a profit Target it it was not nearly as as effective to do a 50% profit Target there as it was to do something more like 20 25% um and so this got me to thinking sort of we've been taking 50% is sort of just given for so long maybe we should see what happens if we mix that up a bit even in looking at 45d DT trades so let's let's get into it how long have short premium trades needs to stay in positions in order to reach different profit targets yep cool Do It um and because I want to do a different a variety of deltas and a variety of profit targets we're only doing one underly today it's all it's all going to be spy options it's all 45 DT strangles um we're going to do a a sort of a a look at a bunch of different distances from the money and a d of different profit targets and we're going to look at sort of at a couple of statistics about that we're going to look at um how many of them actually reached their profit Target and then of those that reached their profit Target so this is not looking at all the ones that didn't just what was the average amount of profit collected um right uh which is very close to you know what was the average you know what was the average uh credit received times the profit Target um and then what was the the more interesting fact for me is the what was the average number of business days that you had to stay in the position form management um okay uh right so if we were getting out at 21 DTE that's like you know about 20 business days later um if we're getting out less than that that means that we were managing earlier if we're taking longer than that means we were sort of staying in past that 21 DT line um and then lastly I just wanted to pull out the right there's some number of Trades that never reach their profit Target but still wind up being winners at expiration and I wanted to just see how frequent that is and how that plays into how far from the money and what your profit Target was um so that'll be the last statistic we look at oh yeah so we can get into it now let look at some numbers yeah so when we're trading real close to the money you know these 40 40 Delta strangles um we see that the 50% profit Target if you do a 25% profit Target you manage most trades right 84% of them Reach it and of those that don't only there's only a 6% right of those that don't right 10% are just losers and then 6% wind up being in that winner but not but didn't reach 25% profit Target winner right so that's sort of explaining how those those work out um right and the average managed profit scales exactly like you would expect but the interesting part lies in the sort of the number of days where at 50% profit Target wound up being very similar to getting out at 21 DTE as far as like when you actually wound up leaving it that was around when profit profitable trades managed to reach that if you were looking for 75% profit Target you were staying in significantly longer right you you were in there for essentially another like almost two weeks MH right week and a half and yeah and you're and your profit didn't go up that substantially either and in fact right you're not managing that many of those trades only 35% of the trades reach 75% top Target in fact much of the profitability there came from just the 39% of Trades that that were somewhere in the middle that were like 50% or 60% at expiration yeah yeah so I think that this this slide to me makes it a very appealing to you sort of a lower profit Target when trading close to the money we we'll see that sort of play out as we go forward that I I think the the the main takeway for today is an idea that you can be a little bit more flexible in your profit Target with the idea of when you're trading close to the money take your profits a little bit faster and if you're trading further out of the money you can be a little bit more patient um so yeah let's let's go forward and see if how that plays out as we look at the other strangles so yeah 30 Deltas right so here we sort of the the our our you know core position put them on all the time kind of Trades um and here we see that 25% profit Target again has this like is probably too aggressive right you're managing almost all of them very and it's very quickly so if if you're willing to put on new trades all the time you can do it but you're really cutting into your profits a lot and you're essentially all of the losers are are are getting are getting all of the win anything that might be a winner ever is getting managed right only 5% of Trades are managing to come out that that middle space um and here right here's 50% and I think this sort of fits with why we wound up with 50% as a profit Target is cuz we were all using 20 and 30 Delta strangles as our Baseline when we came up with those numbers years ago and here I think it's it's pretty appe here I think the 50% profit Target one is sort of the most appealing row of of this column of this slide um right you're you're in there for less than less than you know only a couple of weeks and you might make good profits so as we move further out you see that it becomes more extreme and those 25% profit targets those really aggressive managements become sort of I think too aggressive um and but conversely the the 75% profit Target start stops looking so bad right um here in the 20 Delta strangles it's uping I still think here I'd prefer the 50% uh profit Target here but you know the 75% one also has a reasonable uh stat line you know if you're selling 20 Delta strangles you can be sort of in that range is okay um and then when we move out to the 16 Delta strangle we'll see that like 50% profit Target is probably too low actually for a 16 Delta strangle um as we go let's let's take a look one more yeah here we are um right because cuz here we're winding up with this thing again where where oh uh the 26 and 22 days are flipped that is just a Tipo okay yeah um I apologize be 10 22 26 which what you me got it right here you see that right like looking for 75% profits out of your 16 Dela strangles doesn't actually make them take that much longer if they those that reach 50% profits very frequently also reach 75% profit not that much later um and right that's partially because the credits are so small right that there's not that much distance to move um when when you're when you've got a good position like that but I think that this is sort of my my like thing that someone actually might change about their mechanics going forwards here having looked at this piece is that if you're trading real far out of the money if you're in that sort of 161 Delta strangle kind of range if you like those far out of the money trades which is a valid thing to like you maybe want to be a little bit more patient with your profits um you know let them come in a little bit further before you take them off uh you know don't wait till expiration all the time we know that really blows up your your about risk and such but you can be a little bit more patient wait till they get past 50% right if it's past the 21 Day line maybe you want to manage it anyway but if you're still in the first half of the trade and you've taken in a good profit you maybe can stay in it a little bit longer and see if it it mature you know ripens a bit more for you yeah it it makes sense oh sorry and Jacob you think that's because of small credit you receive on Entry I mean is that really yeah I think that's I think that's the primary thing going on right it's it's smaller credit and it's the fact that the position was sort of safer to begin with by bringing out of the money so you can be a little bit more patient with letting it letting it come in for you um makes sense makes sense right and of course right this is just a testing of like some fixed points so it doesn't say where the like real optimal profit targets would be right maybe it's like 63% would be the best performing one I don't know um but this is to give people you know at home sort of their ballpark for how they want to adjust in a more of a qualitative sense of the further the money you are be a little bit more patient your profits if you're trading real close to the money be real aggressive take those off quickly put fresh ones on um seems like the the the real winning strategy from from this piece totally agree good job good job yeah we we can go takeways but I think I have more us y uh more aggressively capturing winners more reliably Trad profitable but lower average profits very straightforward and and intuitive um because of their smaller initial credits for the other money positions were better able to reach larger portions of their maximum profit um so while we often default to 50% profit targets being willing to lower this further out of the money and and uh or close to the money and raise it further out of the money may give you sort of more consistent nicer results over long term so I think that's a nice little you know just little little everyone can refine their management mechanics every week around here
