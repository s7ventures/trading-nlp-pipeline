what's up everybody Welcome to the life cycle of a trade the series where we break down the thought process behind trade entry trade adjustments and closing order in this video we are going to cover a custom trade a put ratio with a naked [Music] call one of the stocks I'm going to take a look at here um is ccj it's one that we've traded a couple times it's near the highs that it's been trading at um it's had a really nice run to the upside trading about $60 here it's actually just off of the 52 we high as you can see on the right side quick menu uh details over here when we look at the stock it's got an iv rank of 16 so it's not super high but you have to keep in into account that volatility is at lows the vix itself at 13 volatility features 1430 so very low implied volatility across the market uh for me here I'm looking to lean a tiny bit short on this position uh what I was thinking was this is a perfect uh stock to be short premium in for me naked short premium because it uses a small amount of capital even doing a strangle here uh only used about 750 bucks in buying power which is perfect for my portfolio size and given that I'm collecting a $3 is credit this would set up perfect I'm going to get a little bit spicier with this position and do a a short call with a put ratio spread so when you have a strangle your risk profile and we'll see this on the curve view uh you have risk on both sides of the stock right your your your risk is one contract on either side what you can do with a with a naked position is instead of just having the the sh put you can make this a put ratio spread and still synthetically be just be short just one contract on the downside so we look at this risk profile it leans you a little bit you have an extra Delta to the downside here you can see I'm short 30 Deltas on this position and that's because I'm buying this put spread basically for a small debit here on this trade you can see I'm selling this at 186 that means I'm buying this put ratio spread I'm buying it for 50 cents uh net net I'm selling some premium here $230 odd here on the downside but buying this at 310 it gives you a little bit of of more room to the downside and also a higher profit potential because you have that embedded put spread here but you'll see it only uses a couple dollars more in buying power relative to the strangle and that's just because my my break even on the upside is two or $ three do closer so you have a little bit more risk on the upside so the buying power is just a tiny bit more than what it would be with the regular naked strangle both trades have positive Theta um you know they've their short volatility this trade though itself has a higher profit potential because you have that $5 wide put ratio spread where if the stock were to drop to 55 you'd have $5 of value via this put spread plus uh the1 38 uh in credit that we're collecting on the entry here so you got a little bit of an extra bang for your buck here on the move to the downside so we're going to get this trade on 136 we'll see if we get filled here 134 Market's moving a little bit 124 God this thing is mov in stock is dropping a little bit and I have short Delta which means that the price of this is going down as we speak 119 come on there we go we got filled at 119 on that short call put ratio spread all right so we've got an interesting position here to manage we've got our ccj put ratio with a naked call so if you remember when we put this trade on synthetically the risk was very similar to a strangle uh we had the short 65 call we did the 6055 put ratio spread so we had an extra put on the downside so we had two two puts here one of them is covered by this long option so you're naked the 5565 strangle is synthetically what you're naked here with an added long put spread and that long put spread Hedges you to the downside of course but also adds potential added profits to the position so when we put this trade on we did it for a a nice $119 credit what has happened along the way is that our call here has lost basically all of its value and this put rtio IO has actually gained value so if we look at this put ratio right now this put ratio is trading for 21 C Credit around that maybe a little bit higher actually because the bid out spreads are are a little bit wide and that's because this spread between the 60 and the 55 is worth $5 the stock right now is trading uh right around 5158 here uh which means that this spread net of where the stock is trading at would trade at a dollar 50 it's a $150 and change above the 50 strike which is what this position would trade at at expiration if the stock was right here where it's trading right now we can even see this on the analysis mode so um when we jump over to the curve view our risk profile we have the Theo expiration here this is at expiration our profit here as you could see would be somewhere around uh $200 in change which includes the credit that we have on the original entry the19 on Entry plus $150 to $170 depending on where the stock is marked that would be our ma our profit based on where the stock is trading at right now so the trade has gone completely our way and one of the interesting things with this sort of short premium position is that you actually put the trade on for a credit and if you're if you're right where you get some time Decay some volatility contraction a little bit of of a price move in your direction if you get some of those factors right you can actually close this trade for another credit so credit open Credit close very interesting position so we're going to go ahead and close this position we're going to buy back the call we're going to sell out of the 60 strike put and we're going to buy back our two short 50 puts uh 55 puts here and we're going to try and do this for for a decent credit here 15 cents uh which will be our our closing price here so let's try this at 15 at 15 s see if we get filled no fill there all right so we got filled on that position for an 8 cent credit so we opened that position at $119 credit closed it an 8 cent credit we were able to get that credit for the close because of that put ratio spread gaining value even though it went in the money $127 profit nice trade free an out on Capital as well
