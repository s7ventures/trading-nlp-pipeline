  "currency gains Market pains we we never cover currencies either at our um uh during our Market measures so this is a fun but here is the thing that they were going for traditionally Traders believe that a strong currency would have a negative impact on the stock market which is obviously not has not really been the case because the US dollar has been super strong and the stock markets just off of record highs so the correlation between the you between the US Stock market and US currency has not",
  "the US Stock market and US currency has not been um inversely or positively correlated it's basically been it hasn't been much of anything over time it's really been no correlation that's why we look at at currency plays as being very indifferent I like currency plays because they're some they're they're just a different type of trade to have on um so far they haven't worked if you've been short short dollars and I've pretty much been short dollars which means I'm L on the currencies yes yes so",
  "which means I'm L on the currencies yes yes so what we're trying to say here is that if the US Dollar's value is rising the stock market generally expected to Trend downward and that hasn't been the case until the last three days um but let's see let's see what's really happened over the last X number of years let's go next slide I don't know how many years they're doing here total so first a little macro background a strong dollar combined with high interest rates could potentially slow",
  "with high interest rates could potentially slow economic growth um concerns about the Slowdown can lead to reduced investor confidence reduced competitivness of companies with global exposure sure because everything costs more in the US um a strong dollar means that foreign revenues translate into fewer dollars which can reduce overall reported earnings and the investment yield shift Capital may be attracted to the bond markets or to other high yield investment vehicles instead of equities due",
  "yield investment vehicles instead of equities due to the high yields available in the debt Market all these things are reasons why you know reasons to invest in anything but the underlying stock hence lower stock prices strong dollar lower stock price that's always what's what thought what's been thought let's go next slide we I've always treated these as two very independent you know non-correlated assets but currently the US dollar is at its strongest point of the last two decades it's",
  "its strongest point of the last two decades it's nearing its highest level against the Yen it's reached its second highest level against the Euro surpassed only by levels in September of last year but as you can see the Euro's basically close to 100 and the yen is is wherever the end is now 64 63 so here are some relevant facts interest rates not only is the dollar strong but the US Treasury yield has reached its highest level since 2007 higher than in most developed countries and we put it up",
  "than in most developed countries and we put it up on the screen for you us interest rates are this is the 10-year of 4.5 s and then down the road you can see all the other ones the the UK is very similar but the other countries are all much lower with Japan has been in that one that 1% range for forever we call this International exposure this slide so foreign revenues make up 28% of the S&P 500's total revenues more than 3,000 us companies engage in foreign production including 99 of the",
  "engage in foreign production including 99 of the nation's 100 largest industrial corporations America's largest P public company generate 41% of their revenue outside of the US and many large scale multinational corporations have more than half their sales outside the US for example Intel generates 78% of its sales internationally by Coca-Cola while Coca-Cola is 68% do you know what tasty is O I do not know Traders trading from all around the world using tasty trade generate around 20 I think",
  "using tasty trade generate around 20 I think it's around 22% of our Revenue wow maybe 23 % something like that but it's a bigger number than I thought yeah me too so given this logical framework we wanted to analyze whether the market supports the theory that a strong dollar negatively impacts stocks so to explore this we track the US dollar Index USDX which is calculated based on the exchange rates between the US dollar and a basket of six major currencies and you can see we put the waiting um",
  "currencies and you can see we put the waiting um to the the now s off if if that question was given to you prior to this year I I mean I I would have said yeah for sure a strong dollar is bad for the market would you would you agree yes I would have agreed but not prior to this year prior to the last couple years yeah yeah right yep absolutely so we look at this here's the long-term correlation between the S&P this is longterm and the US dollar which is point which is negative .17 so that is a",
  "which is point which is negative .17 so that is a nothing correlation now we've known this for at Tasty we've known this because we've talked about the positions in in um currencies being non-correlated so this is not like a surprise to us but right negative .17 is no correlation at all that's the S&P to the US dollar rolling three-month correlation now we're going to examine the five strongest and five weakest years for the dollar to determin whether its value significantly impacts the stock",
  "whether its value significantly impacts the stock market in extreme environments going all the way back to 1990 it's a pretty extensive study so in the strongest years for the dollar the daily correlation with market performance is weak contrary to Theory the market is more likely to see positive returns with a strong dollar than it is negative returns like look at you know 97 2005 2014 1992 and you know you can even argue 2000 it's nothing but I guess my point here is is that the correlation",
  "I guess my point here is is that the correlation in all these cases is negligible it's almost nothing so you're talking about a nothing correlation dollar up stock market up right right in the weakest years for the dollar the correlation is slightly stronger but still weak to moderate combined with the previous analysis there's no strong pattern between dollar value and stock market performance over the long term stock market just goes up all the time S&P is up you know whatever but the US",
  "the time S&P is up you know whatever but the US dollar down US dollar down US dollar down US dollar down us down in all those in all those examples and the stock market's up in well it's up in two of those cases and and the correlation is still 0. 2 or3 it's not it's nothing yeah that's what I need this year is the US dollar down 16% and the stock market unchanged make that happen please do my best for you I'll do your at least for a day or two give you a chance so the takeaway is from this",
  "give you a chance so the takeaway is from this traditional beliefs that the US Dollar's value should negatively impact the overall Market is outdated because we have looked at the best five years and the worst five years for the US dollar and the correlation is negligible and the the stock market's um returns are also mixed and completely random so however the evidence shows a weak correlation between them over the long term and that is correct there is a very weak correlation between the US",
  "there is a very weak correlation between the US dollar and stock market returns and those returns are so random that there's no no possible takeaway that we could say that if the US dollar actually starts to sell off that the that that currencies are going to go significantly higher I I'm sorry the stock market's gonna go higher or lower can't make can't make an assumption one way or the other correct yes exactly"
