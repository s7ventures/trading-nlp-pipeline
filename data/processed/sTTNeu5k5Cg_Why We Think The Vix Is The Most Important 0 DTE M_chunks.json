  "zero DTE profits zero DTE profit targets and the vixs this is a piece that Jacob and his team put together and I think you're going to like it lately this is our zero DT piece once a week lately we've been looking to refine our Mechanics for managing zero DT winners experienced option Traders know that the implied volatility environment can be one of the most important things to keep your eye on how have different profit targets for selling zero DT premium performed based on the level of the vix",
  "premium performed based on the level of the vix at Market open so we use two years worth of data and and we are going to examine selling 30 Delta strangles every day at the market open with the Winter's closed and a variety of profit targets ranging from 15 to 45% we contrast the performance between those days when the vix opened above or below its mean which is 16002 kind of weird that we're right there on yeah that's where we are 16007 right now yeah so we're right there uhhuh so are we below",
  "yeah so we're right there uhhuh so are we below so this is weird so it's a perfect study for today all trades were assumed to be mid-priced and blah blah blah if you want to buy the wings you know they take off about 15 cents per day um so below 16 or basically above 16 all right okay that's it what do you think here I'm hoping about 16 works out better but I don't know let's go to next slide at a 50-50 shot okay so remember these are 30 Delta strangles in the SPX zero days cash settled and",
  "strangles in the SPX zero days cash settled and again we are going to talk about kind of what's optimal we've always said that optimally you'd like to be in that 25% target range so we do overall the 25% target range here 90% win rate $85 that's your wheelhouse baby that's it with the high vix okay the win rate's about the same 88 verse 90 the p&l is about the same yeah at 87 doesn't change much the difference is the profit Target on the 35% goes way up and the average pnl on on the average p&l",
  "way up and the average pnl on on the average p&l on all the other strikes goes way up you go back one slide for a second Beth okay 42 it goes up pretty significantly Tom 4285 7533 now go to the next slide so the 42 goes to 54 that's 20% higher the 85 goes to 887 that's nothing but the next two have a huge the bigger the option you know the bigger the profit Target the more money you make yeah so the so the higher and that's in a higher right that's high vix yeah so you can change you got to",
  "that's high vix yeah so you can change you got to manage a lot earlier in in a lower vix and you can kind of hang in there with a higher vix the sear and the win rates stay the same MH so not much there so all it's saying here is that in high vix if you raise your profit targets a little bit you do better that's all and high vix is better for average p&l yep yep let's go to the next slide which is loix so on the loix and I don't think this surprises any of us the win percentages are virtually",
  "any of us the win percentages are virtually the same so the win percentages don't change what changes is the average p&l so at the 25% profit Target you're good amazing you're good there's no difference between High vix and low vix all the other all the other numbers 15% 35% or 45% I don't even understand why are significantly worse in low volatility High Vol everything worlder Lal all the numbers stay the same win percentage but the average P only works at 25% the takeaway here is when in",
  "P only works at 25% the takeaway here is when in doubt 25% if the vix is super high you can hold out a little bit more but when in doubt 25% that's your profit Target as with longer dated options the short zero DT positions perform better off with a high vix than a low vix got it the least affected profit Target was the 25% which was best performing no matter what MH in a high IV environment however trades traders who waited for 35% profit targets often made off better made out better other",
  "often made off better made out better other than the importance of aggressively taking profits Harden fail T rules are tough to come by in the zero DT options but perhaps we can be forgiven for being a little bit more patient with our winners on days when the vix opens High"
