  "Zero DTE profit targets and the VIX are crucial for managing zero DTE winners. Experienced option traders understand the importance of implied volatility. We have been refining our mechanics for managing zero DTE winners weekly. Different profit targets for selling zero DTE premium have been analyzed based on the VIX level.",
  "We analyze the performance of selling 30 Delta strangles daily at market open using two years of data. We compare results when the VIX opens above or below its mean of 16.002.",
  "All trades were assumed to be mid-priced. Buying the wings takes off about 15 cents per day. Below 16 or above 16. Hoping about 16 works out better. 30 Delta strangles in the SPX, zero days cash settled.",
  "Strangles in the SPX zero days cash settled. Optimal target range is 25%. 90% win rate, $85 profit. High VIX, win rate around 88-90%. Profit target at 35% increases, average P&L remains around $87.",
  "As the stock price goes up, the average profit and loss on all other strikes also increases significantly. For example, when the stock price goes from 42 to 54, that's a 20% increase, and from 85 to 887, the profit also increases. The bigger the option, the higher the profit target and potential earnings, especially in high volatility markets.",
  "In high VIX, it is important to manage trades earlier. Adjusting profit targets can lead to better results in high VIX conditions. High VIX is better for average profit and loss. Moving on to low VIX, win percentages are similar.",
  "high volatility, the average profit and loss (P&L) at a 25% profit target remains consistent regardless of the win percentage. However, in low volatility, other profit targets such as 15%, 35%, or 45% result in significantly worse outcomes. The key takeaway is to focus on trading strategies that perform consistently well in both high and low volatility environments.",
  "P only works at 25% profit target. In high VIX, you can hold out a bit more, but 25% is the profit target. Short zero DT positions perform better with high VIX. 25% profit target was the best performing. In high IV environment, traders waiting for 35% profit targets often did better.",
  "Taking profits is important in trading. Rules for trading options can be strict, but it may be acceptable to be patient with winning trades on high volatility days."
