what I developed over years of watching tasty live all the research on Market measures and options Jive and so I developed my own little checklist from that research on an opening trade only selling when an underlying has an ivr of over 35 it's desirable that the 5-day change in IV is positive necessarily doesn't have to be the underlying needs to be very liquid meaning that there's a very tight bid ask spread and making sure that the amount of Premium that you're collecting is is is sufficient for the risk that you're taking so I look for a 20 to 25% premium collected to buying power reduction
