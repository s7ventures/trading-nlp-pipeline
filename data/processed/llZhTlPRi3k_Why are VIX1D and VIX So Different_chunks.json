  "The VIX was higher earlier in the day, but one day it was lower. This discrepancy is due to the difference between one-day implied volatility and monthly implied volatility. The VIX looks out 30 days, while one day only focuses on the present. They are often independent of each other, leading to situations where the VIX one day is significantly lower when there is no significant activity."
