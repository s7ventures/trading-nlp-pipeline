2024 we did the best Market measure part one yesterday we are doing part two today the best time of the day to buy and sell does intraday seasonality exists statistically which five minute bar is the weakest during the day for the S&P 500 using 15 years of market indices and Futures ETFs 11 years of vix um we C we first covered or I'm sorry we first convert the 5 minute price and volume bars into an intraday percentile then we calculate the average of these percentiles for each symbol to get their intraday strength as well as their monthly and overall strength what we found was that low am and high we found a low am and high PM rule market indices tend to be lower in the morning and stronger in the afternoon buy them now bat that's right buy them when you can vix tends to be higher in the morning and weaker in the afternoon yes as time goes by there's less risk sure now I'm going to say something about lower in the morning and higher in the afternoon that is a very typical byproduct of bull markets in bare markets it's the exact opposite so don't get fooled by the bull market bare Market thing the reason that this the last 15 years we've been in a bull market and in Bull markets you open lower and go higher in bare markets which we haven't had for a long time you open higher and go lower so this is a bull market phenomenon but we did study this because this is remember the best of 2024 and 2024 was a bull yes and on average the best time to buy the dip or manage a short position is around 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Standard time or that would be 9:15 right now MH to 10 central time it's when the market is weakest right now bat close your eyes and buy them this heat map shows weak in the morning strong in the afternoon for market indices and it shows the exact opposite for the vix The Greener The Greener the higher the price of the day so that's that's all that is just just um it's a heat map for all market indices in vix Futures the average 5minute percentile crosses around 12:55 Eastern Standard Time which is noon in Chicago the vix surrenders around one Eastern stand time because they're inversely correlated this is noon in Chicago again this is why you got to be careful with those zero DTS and the upside risk at the end of the day in Bull markets and being long volatility going into the end of the day this is a U-shaped volume curve um in the middle of the day it's lowest and the market volume decelerates from morning to noon and then it re accelerates in the afternoon this was a fun piece and and that's why we like to trade when it's busiest morning and close but to be fair it doesn't matter much anymore let's go to the next slide it doesn't matter much anymore because of Technology yeah technology has kind of technology has has changed that game dramatically the possible theory behind the buy the dip morning momentum lighter volume easier accumulation nah I I know what they're writing here but I don't like it I think that the reason for it is is that it's a it's just simply a bull market phenomenon there's also an argument that there's macroeconomic data releases and that lighter volume means e easier uh accumulation but I'm not buying it um volatility tends to peak in the morning and decline in the afternoon fear is often overstated and as the day goes on people become less fearful it's like anything else you hop on a roller coaster you're scared to death once you get up to the top and you start going down you're like yeah it's nothing yeah hop in a wh Mo you're not so sure about what to expect there you go Si off you just did it yourself and you know what in the middle of the ride you forget you're even in a weo and by the end of the ride you say you know what I'm gonna do that again I'm not building any more bridges there you go this is a correlation heat map it's just a little a different way of looking at it um but it's the average price percent on the time confirms a weak a. and strong PM again this is a bull market pattern and don't think that it will last into perpetuity but until the market rolls over so far so good mhh and the inverse for volatility um in December we saw the vix and the market um act a little differently than it's acted the whole rest of the year the rest the year was really bullish and we didn't we basically didn't have a down tick all year but starting in December and we had a little bit more two-sided action and actually the Market's down a little bit for the last couple of weeks so that is true welcome to a two-sided Market a choppy December can we predict what's next not really but we know a couple things a we know that January tends to be among the highest volume months part of it's because of leap options part of it's because of people come back after you know they're all fired up and ready to go clean slate everything else um but January shows that the vix tends to be strongest around until around 10:15 eastern time and then it gradually declines by 12:25 starting in January the vix is overtaken by all the major market indices and goes the opposite way that's just the same chars we've been showing all along really interesting though beautiful picture how about February along with November febru no along with November February is statistically one of the best months to buy the morning dip and here's a little just historical evidence to that these months often see the vixs morning Bluff early volatility fade creating opportunities over the last 10 or 15 years we've had some really nasty end of January early February of which the market has started off weak and finished strong the strongest average percentile of vixs five minute Bars by month and so we're looking you know again between that 10 and 11:00 Eastern time or 9 to 10 central time which is right where we are right now bullish Trend post 2008 financial crisis yes we have been in a 15-year bull market of which you open lower and go higher that's just the way bull markets work every day they try to scare you a little bit and when the when when the fear runs out they they they buy them until your hands bleed um so timing of by the dip month specific strategies each month has its statistically best 5 minute bars and then low am high PM phenomenon the vix has the inverse but it has been very true from September to December and the best months for buying morning dips February May June and November I don't know how that's possible February May June and November who would have d
