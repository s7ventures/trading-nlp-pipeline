BTO is a Bitcoin Futures ETF so I went and Googled it and what they do in bit which I had no idea is that they have a monthly dividend and bitto is not an expensive stock let me just see $24.75 it's 2475 and they pay a $1 dividend and a 45% return the last 12 months they paid out almost $13 in dividends so if Bitcoin goes higher they out capital gains because it's a Futures product
