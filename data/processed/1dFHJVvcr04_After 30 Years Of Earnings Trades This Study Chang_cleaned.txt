what comes after earnings let's take a look do stocks go the way of earnings or do they go the other way uh I I I believe after earnings I believe they they Trend sideways for the most part I mean I think depending on the and again I haven't seen this the the study set I would say it was sideways to higher just because we're at all-time high snof so the question is if you have an earnings report that's in line obviously afterwards the Market's probably going to do you know the same as it was doing before but if you have a stock that has a really good earnings report or a really bad earnings report do you think the market continues to Trend in the direction that it went or do you think that it all normalizes and just becomes random again in a in a 45 day time frame after the trade is made I got to say it's all random immediately following I would say it kind of stays in the direction it's in I don't know if I'm answering I don't know if I'm answering to the to the study let's take a very good let's take a good hard look at this because it's really interesting and some of the results are a little different than you might think publicly traded companies released quarterly earnings reports detailing their financial performance these reports come out either before the Market opens or after the market closes the overnight moves accompanying these releases are often dramatic because this is anticipated implied volatility is typically elevated just before earnings and falls off after we've explored placing earnings trades before but whether you have an earnings position still on or you're considering trading and underlying now that the dust is settled what happens to the underlyings in the weeks following an earnings report this is an important question for retail Traders let's take a look this is the first kind of study we've done exactly on like this topic next slide please John so We examined each earnings announcement from the 15 largest components of the S&P 500 for the past eight years so it's a massive study for each we looked at the overnights earnings move and the 7-Day move and then the 30-day move close to close um following the earnings move we looked at overnight 7day 30-day all right all right correlation from minus one to plus one between the size of the earnings moves and the size of the following moves how frequently the following move was the same direction as the earnings move as we call that continuation the average size of the seven and 30 day moves meaning the the mean the mean absolute so we contrasted the overall statistics those following earnings moves that did or did not exceed the implied move and we just put a little caveat at the bottom says note that these earnings moves only stayed inside expected 48% of the time far below theoretical or the empirical non- earnings frequencies yeah okay okay let's go to the next slide so what comes after earnings so the first what we looked at was overall okay so the correlation the continuation and the mean absolute move so this is interesting because you know how sometimes we go well it's only got priced in a 3% move and stuff like this remember this is the top 15 stocks over eight years in the S&P 500 so when we look at the overall the size correlation and the continuation the first thing that pops up here is that um you know what these moves tend to be a little greater than whatever the expectation is right around earnings because those are higher numbers the absolute the mean absolute move and the continuation number is a little higher than a random number would be yeah I mean they're just they're a little bit higher so the size correlation is also interesting in saying that after seven days there's some correlation after 30 days there's a little less correlation but the continuation of the move is pretty good so on this slide um this is with earnings inside the expected move now of course if it's inside the expected move the correlation is going to be be lower and the continuation is going to be lower and then the mean absolute move after 7 days is obviously smaller and after 30 days is small so when they're inside the expected move I would say this is pretty random 52% you know that that's probably in in line with just a completely random number so if the earnings are inside the expected move then there's not that much to actually consider right about a continuation or stuff like that yeah 100% let's go to the next Slide John this is earnings outside of the expected move well here everything changes and you can look at the size correlation you can look at the continuation numbers and you can look at the size of the mean absolute move and what happens for earnings moves outside of the expected move is that there tends to be a very high continuation move after the actual after the number comes out so if you have a really bad earnings report there tends to be you know eight out of 10 times the stock continues to go lower after seven days and seven out of 10 times after 30 days and this is in the top 15 stocks in the S&P 500 and and if it's and and I think those numbers are do have a lot of value to them agreed I I think they do to and the mean absolute move is usually greater than you think it's going to be so it means you got to be a little bit aggressive especially if you're looking to roll up the untested side or do anything like that I mean that's my takeaway I think that's fair yeah this is this is a very this is a very powerful slide that we haven't done before and it's funny because if I think back about emails that I get for earnings you know if if a stock moves let's say you know outside the expected move to the downside even though the Market's a little bit you know bid the way it is right now at at Market highs you know people sit for a couple of days because they think it's going to correlate with the market or come back a little bit most of the time the it is like what do I do now I didn't roll that kind of thing so I think being aggressive with the rolling is probably uh my biggest takeway for this okay bigger numbers than I thought way bigger I thought there'd be a little bit of positive you know outlier moves would be have a little bit of positive continuation but not from 5050 to 8 out of 10 when earnings moves fell within the expectation the underlying afterwards performed like the underlyings any other time that's exactly what we that was our takeaway the following unexpected large earning moves however we saw the underlyings making large moves very frequently continuing in the direction of earnings like 70 to 80% of the time these moves might well be anticipated and priced into the premiums available post earnings but understanding what is typical following earnings can help you choose how to play it yes it definitely is going to influence it impact our decision somewhat so very good uh Market
