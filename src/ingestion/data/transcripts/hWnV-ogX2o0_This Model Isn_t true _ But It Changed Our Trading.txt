0.00 - cuz we're going to talk about the black
0.80 - Scholls model and I I mean I had a talk
3.68 - with a a very intelligent uh econ PhD
6.96 - person who is like how can you spend so
9.24 - much time talking about black schs model
11.12 - when we just know objectively that it's
13.08 - not
13.88 - true and so I felt like I needed to
16.36 - really explain like even though it's not
18.32 - true where the value comes from like why
20.76 - it's a good thing to sort of frame
22.52 - everything else in terms of and and I
24.52 - came up with this uh heliocentric
26.96 - analogy and so we'll we'll we'll get
28.84 - through that
30.84 - okay uh so blackrolls model um right
34.56 - when you come up with a financial model
36.04 - the the goal at least for in an options
38.24 - world is to come up with some sort of
39.76 - way to model the how prices behave so
42.24 - that you can get a a you know a
43.96 - tractable solution for for how much an
45.80 - option should cost right it doesn't help
47.40 - if you have some really abstract model
49.08 - that the math doesn't come out of and
50.52 - you don't R it with values at the end um
52.96 - so we're going to that that's the goal
55.24 - that that's what's set out as the goal
56.52 - here and there's a couple of uh
58.56 - observations you do one is that well
60.56 - firstly it's got to be in terms of
62.04 - returns right the the scale of things
63.76 - can't matter right splits shouldn't
65.28 - really affect things right the it has to
67.60 - be in terms of returns um and
70.92 - then straight returns you know the
73.00 - current price divided by the previous
74.36 - price the future price divided by the
75.52 - current price those don't add together
77.96 - right they multiply together right if
79.24 - you want to know the price two years
80.76 - from now you need to multiply the
82.20 - returns one year from now and the
83.28 - returns between one in two years from
84.72 - now um and you could do that um but we
87.80 - don't have as many theorems that apply
89.12 - to multiplication as as we do to
90.32 - addition and so we just do this
91.72 - algebraic trick and we take the logs and
93.44 - this is why we care about log returns
94.80 - we've talked about this before um that
97.44 - it's it's this kind of convenient trick
99.36 - that turns multiplication into addition
101.32 - and that means that we can use our
102.48 - theorems like the central limit theorem
104.08 - um if we kept it in terms of returns
105.92 - we'd wind up with some sort of geometric
107.52 - Central limit theorem which would say
108.76 - that the product of a bunch of
109.88 - independent random variables is a
111.68 - geometric is a log is a log normally
114.12 - distributed and we end up in the same
116.20 - place but the math would be a little bit
117.68 - less familiar for the mathematically
118.96 - inclined um so we're going to talk in
121.28 - log returns and then we look at sort of
123.36 - just the weak efficient market
124.52 - hypothesis says that you're going to
125.76 - have Independence over D joint time
127.12 - intervals and then here's where the big
129.64 - untrue right the the false assumption
131.52 - comes in and we say the underlyings are
133.56 - time homogeneous right that they don't
135.12 - have distinct periods right that they're
137.28 - always behaving roughly the same you
138.88 - know you don't get the same output all
140.08 - the time but the probabilistically it's
141.96 - all the same um if we had that and
145.56 - Independence over Destro time intervals
147.52 - we'd get the central limit theorem would
148.92 - apply because we could cut it into a lot
150.28 - of little pieces say that it's all any
152.12 - any long span is the sum of many short
154.64 - spans each of the short spans are the
156.72 - same and independent so total they have
159.00 - to be normal and we got the central
160.52 - limit theorem and then we arrive so we
162.08 - get that log returns are going to evolve
163.40 - as Brownian motions Central limit
165.04 - theorem says that it's normals bring
166.68 - motions are the sums of a bunch of
168.40 - normals um and so that that gets us the
170.96 - whole black Rolls model that's the whole
172.12 - justification uh let's roll forward one
173.76 - Beth and then the output of that is
175.32 - exactly what we were hoping for a
177.48 - relatively convenient closed form
179.08 - expression for the fair price of an
180.32 - option given some inputs right if you
182.28 - have the strike the time until
183.56 - expiration the current the current spot
185.92 - price and this Sigma parameter which
189.36 - we're going to call volatility later but
190.84 - for now it's sort of a morphous
193.32 - parameter and the idea is that the sigma
194.72 - squared is the infant tmal variation on
197.04 - the Brownian motion that's driving our
198.48 - log returns so it's how Wiggly it is how
200.96 - fast it's moving um per unit time um and
205.88 - this is the one not directly observable
207.48 - piece but because the formula strictly
210.40 - increasing in terms of it if we have
212.64 - market prices we can invert the formula
214.72 - and get an implied volatility and that's
216.80 - sort of the the you know where we get a
218.60 - lot of the meat out of our use of the
219.88 - black sholls model is it's where we get
221.96 - our implied volatilities from right
223.40 - there's no hon model implied volatility
224.96 - because you'd also have a volatility a
226.28 - volatility parameter and there' be a
227.76 - whole Space of possibilities that
229.16 - explain current prices so the nice thing
231.44 - about black formula is that a single
232.96 - price turns into a single volatility in
234.68 - a nice one to one uh way unfortunately
238.48 - let's roll forward
240.76 - the market prices don't support the
242.20 - black shols model right it said that
244.32 - they should they should be the the sigma
246.92 - should be a property of the underlying
248.88 - and in but in actuality when you look at
250.44 - different options even on the same
251.60 - underlying they give different sigmas
253.68 - they in incompatible values for the
255.16 - implied volatility you get this surface
257.28 - right where if you look at different
258.76 - strikes and different times until
260.48 - expiration you get different implied
262.40 - volatilities typically they go up away
264.16 - from the spot and out about in time but
266.96 - that the important part is this that
268.00 - it's not flat right if the if black
270.16 - charoll model is true this picture would
271.52 - just be a flat plane but it's not um
274.40 - right so this is what we're saying the
275.40 - black trolls model isn't
277.24 - true why do we put up with it then why
279.48 - do we keep talking about it why do we
280.76 - keep using it well let's go for it one
283.00 - and we'll we'll
284.16 - see um sort of the thing we keep using
289.00 - it because there's never going to be a
290.84 - true financial model in in the way that
293.12 - these people want right when you have a
295.12 - physical model oh Tom's falling asleep
297.44 - oh
298.32 - no to go to sleep on you I no we have a
302.84 - physical model right like how a ball
304.60 - flies through the air we can model we
306.72 - can write down our formulas for how we
308.00 - think it's going to happen we have
309.44 - someone kick the ball we observe how the
310.80 - ball flies and we can check oh how good
313.00 - was our model did it describe how the
314.68 - ball flew yes or no um social sciences
317.92 - wind up with this this problem called
319.24 - The Observer Paradox that prevents them
320.60 - from modeling things well where when you
322.48 - ask people questions they change their
324.24 - answers all right you people behave
326.16 - differently when they know they're being
327.16 - watched um but financial math hasn't
329.44 - even deeper problem which is sort of a
331.44 - describer Paradox where the models that
335.00 - you make influence how people trade
338.20 - which then influences the prices that
339.52 - are trying to be modeled so the the
340.88 - model influences its own output um right
343.60 - so this picture on the bottom right is
345.44 - 1987 which is before 1987 people really
348.24 - like the black shs model so much that
349.60 - they priced all the options as if it was
351.16 - absolutely true and then 1987 people
354.28 - realiz well maybe that's not right and
356.00 - there was a big crash about it and can
357.84 - you guys tell me why is there so much
359.12 - paper in in the air how did that happen
361.64 - What 198 1987 proved the model wrong
366.84 - right I mean they were equally priced on
368.60 - each side so that's why they had to
370.40 - change it and put in skew right I mean
373.16 - it wasn't
374.60 - that Traders got around and said oh we
377.04 - have to change the model it was no the
379.92 - the appetite for downside protection
382.92 - changed forever in the market even to
385.80 - this day and that's why you have skew
388.20 - why is there so much paper in the air
389.88 - that's really kind of false like we
391.96 - didn't throw paper in the air the last
394.96 - day of the year or the or maybe if there
397.16 - was a big Market move or something like
399.12 - that people would throw paper I threw
400.60 - paper every day up in the air yeah I
402.92 - took all my all my your your receipts
405.84 - all my receipts ripped them in a little
407.16 - tiny piece that's why everybody had an
408.32 - out trade with you cuz you didn't keep
409.52 - your receipts I kept my receipts the
411.24 - morning I reconcile can I say something
414.20 - about this
416.08 - the the reason that there was the reason
420.08 - that it wasn't necessary that it was
423.28 - exact was because anytime you're first
426.68 - building a product the markets are wide
429.20 - enough that it made up for the um for
433.68 - small inefficiencies and
435.68 - inaccuracies because remember everything
439.12 - was wide nothing was decimalized and um
443.16 - and you could all they really needed
446.00 - black shells to do was to create um a
450.28 - pricing a a a symmetrical model that you
453.72 - could price everything off of because
455.24 - everything was done in everybody's heads
457.12 - so that's one of the reasons that it
458.76 - suffered from some of the inefficiencies
461.80 - you know over the years obviously as as
464.20 - the business grew everything became a
466.68 - lot more um measured and efficient and
470.72 - then therefore black shells got
472.32 - significantly better as everybody
473.56 - tweaked it
474.88 - mhm everyone sort of dialed in and made
477.12 - it more and more accurate until someone
479.08 - decided they really wanted some downside
480.60 - protection we didn't even have computers
483.12 - we didn't even have computers back then
484.52 - we used to figure out by hand so and
486.92 - then and then you know and then the
488.16 - handheld computers were really weak so
490.28 - it wasn't like it wasn't something
492.04 - that's that simple so that's where all
494.04 - the inefficiency came from the
495.52 - Brilliance of the model is that
499.20 - everybody stayed with it because it
501.72 - worked so good and it was just it was
504.32 - really able to just you know everybody
507.08 - was able to customize it and and use it
509.28 - as the
510.32 - foundation the blue this is what I'm
512.40 - saying right there's this description
513.76 - thing right it works so well because
515.52 - everyone was using
517.88 - it okay until people until people start
521.76 - disagreeing with it and then it stops
522.92 - working all of a sudden
524.80 - because well believe me even when we
528.00 - built toss we tried to use we tried to
530.16 - put multiple models on the platform
532.64 - because we weren't even sure if black
534.64 - shs was good enough you know so we used
537.00 - multiple models but but in the end and
540.24 - they didn't really matter exactly I
542.72 - think that's right so I think that the
544.32 - thing is that the black sholls model
545.72 - isn't true but it is really useful as
549.20 - the frame of reference and we go forward
550.88 - one the way to think about this is so
553.96 - the ancient Greeks were pretty good at
555.68 - astronomy right they looked at the stars
557.20 - and the planets and the sky and they
558.72 - measured them every day and they wrote
560.20 - it down and then they started doing some
561.40 - math to figure out where they thought
562.48 - things were going to be in the future
564.64 - and they they did it they they you know
566.44 - they they tracked the position of Mars
567.80 - in the sky um every let's Mo move
570.24 - forward one but their formulas for how
573.00 - these planets move are really
574.80 - complicated looking because if you're
576.12 - looking at Mars relative to Earth it
578.96 - comes it it mostly moves around Earth in
581.00 - a circle but it does these like little
582.28 - loop-de-loops because in fact they're
584.24 - both going around the Sun in in pretty
586.56 - stable ellipses and but if you don't
589.76 - focus on the Sun instead you focus on
591.40 - Earth you get this you know this this
593.64 - geocentric model which has this very
595.32 - complicated formula for the motion of
597.28 - Mars um and it took until the cernus to
601.28 - say wait if we instead of using Earth as
604.48 - our Center we shift the center of the
606.16 - solar the center of all the planets to
607.96 - the sun then all the formulas become
610.16 - these very simple equations everything's
612.08 - just a very stable ellipse and then
615.12 - their positions relative to each other
616.48 - make a lot of sense and you don't have
617.96 - this defer and epicycle that's trying to
620.48 - measure these interactions between these
622.28 - multiple periods everything is much more
623.92 - straightforward um by picking the right
625.80 - frame of reference in the same way the
628.08 - black shs model isn't true right no
629.72 - underlying behaves like a black sh's
631.80 - underlying but at the same time if
633.56 - you're trying to describe how an
634.96 - underlying is behaving if you just try
636.80 - to do it raw on its own terms just
639.00 - straight from the thing you wind up like
640.52 - the Greeks doing their astronomy with
642.00 - these very convoluted
644.52 - conceptions but if instead you take
647.24 - black schs as a baseline as a frame of
648.96 - reference and you say okay how different
650.84 - from a black schs underlying is this
652.60 - underlying then you can look at the
653.96 - implied volatility surface and say oh
655.56 - okay it's it's got heavier Tails because
657.20 - the surface curves up at the at the
658.60 - sides
659.84 - um right and that that's a much more
661.96 - direct way to read sort of properties of
663.64 - it we can go forward yeah especially
666.36 - because I think most people um have some
668.92 - amount of familiarity with the log with
670.68 - the normal distribution um because of
672.88 - the central limit theorem normal
674.00 - distribution show up all the time in
675.28 - life you know this 30 68% in the middle
678.52 - another 26 or 27% of kind of a one to
681.52 - two standard deviation wings and then
682.80 - these thing you know these out past the
685.24 - these outlier moves all these things are
688.52 - much easier to interpret via using the
691.60 - black schs model as a as a Baseline and
694.48 - then judging how different the current
696.44 - market prices say the underlying is from
698.28 - that right you don't doubt the current
699.88 - market prices but you interpret them via
702.12 - the black schs model to get a much more
703.96 - intable thing right you can look at the
705.56 - implied volatility surface and get a
709.00 - really firm grasp of what the market
711.52 - says about this underlying right is gme
713.92 - has all this has all this call skew most
716.24 - underlines have all this put skew that
717.88 - means that you've got you know big moves
719.48 - in that way and small moves in the other
720.72 - way and if you were just looking at the
721.80 - option prices directly it'd be almost
723.36 - impossible to figure out sort of on your
724.96 - own how to do it without you know
726.72 - decades and Decades of experience uh
728.92 - working on it and so I think that's sort
730.48 - of my point is that the black sholls
731.76 - model is wrong but it is also very right
735.08 - to like use it as your foundational the
738.20 - foundation of your understanding because
739.56 - it's the most clear picture in the same
741.44 - way that if you're trying to model where
742.84 - Mars
743.96 - is it'd be wrong to say that Mars is
746.88 - where the sun is but it is much more
748.72 - helpful to start by looking at the sun
751.08 - and then measure the position of Mars
752.44 - from
753.84 - there I get that and that's
757.20 - it the blacks model is not an accurate
759.76 - description of the underlying price
760.84 - Dynamics um but this isn't such a strike
763.36 - against it because there will never be a
764.60 - perfect financial model um right because
767.68 - model affects the system itself um and
770.80 - using the black of the Baseline can make
772.20 - viewing the market much more
773.20 - intelligible in the same way that
774.40 - heliocentrism simplifies astronomy right
776.80 - if you want to think about Mars moving
778.04 - in a circle or lips you don't want to
780.04 - think about Mars moving in loop-de-loops
781.56 - the same way you want to think about the
783.00 - Spy moving as a put skewed underlying
786.24 - not just an unintelligible randomly
789.16 - moving object
