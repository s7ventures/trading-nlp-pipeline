4.40 - measuring the odds of large daily moves
7.44 - in high volatility
9.60 - stocks huh measuring the odds of large
13.04 - daily moves in high volatility stocks
14.60 - let's go to the sponsored by the CV
16.92 - let's go to the first slide in this
18.20 - segment we delve into the Dynamics of
20.28 - Major Market
21.68 - shifts in an effort to uncover patterns
24.56 - in their
26.80 - occurrence specifically we aim to answer
29.08 - two critical questions
30.84 - all right Pat here are your questions
32.36 - ready How likely are significant Market
34.52 - moves um to happen within a defined time
38.32 - frame and how could we quantify the
40.80 - major ETFs and and liquid single Stocks
44.88 - by analyzing past events of similar
46.64 - magnitude we can assess the probability
48.20 - of such shifts taking place again I
51.84 - think they happen often not too often
55.00 - Major Market moves obviously more so in
58.36 - stocks than ETFs obviously individual
61.04 - stocks sure individual stocks yeah it's
62.40 - harder to move 500 stocks or outside
65.12 - than it is for one stock sure How likely
67.24 - are they going to happen because you
68.52 - know why you know why we're answering
69.84 - this qu you know why we're po because we
71.44 - don't want it to happen we play the
72.92 - don't line exactly exactly the reason we
76.36 - asked this question is because this is
78.96 - not good for
81.00 - business um so let's go next
86.16 - slide so we used two ETFs to spy of the
89.24 - qes and we used used two stocks Tesla
91.56 - and Nvidia the reason we chose Tesla
94.04 - Nvidia is because those are the two most
96.40 - liquid option um of optionable stocks
99.88 - those are the two most liquid of the
101.96 - ETFs spy and the q's are the two most
104.32 - liquid of optionable
107.08 - ETFs we did
109.04 - 2015 to present 10 years we calculated
112.72 - the probabilities of having a certain
114.60 - number of 1% 3% 5% 7%
120.36 - and
121.40 - 10% daily moves in a 5day trading
126.40 - window okay you got that y 1357 and 10
130.56 - in five days
132.80 - okay next slide please I can't guess I
135.48 - mean no no no on the foremost
138.72 - actively the foremost the foremost
141.60 - active option trading
143.28 - Vehicles okay so the first one we start
145.84 - with spy the likelihood of experiencing
150.48 - from four to 5 days a 7 or 10% movement
154.76 - within a single week has been zero for
158.24 - the last 10 years in the
161.20 - Spy however the probability of
164.88 - encountering at least one movement of 1%
169.16 - or more in a week is relatively High
172.48 - Additionally the Spy has an average
174.68 - daily movement of 1.11%
181.64 - so so I mean if you're going to have
183.44 - it's going to happen almost every day if
185.08 - you're going to say that right well
186.80 - let's take a look we have the numbers
189.00 - right in front of you right there mhm
191.32 - and a 1% move and this is just um
195.76 - happening you can see the numbers
197.44 - happening once 25% twice 8% three you
201.52 - know just across the board that's so
202.96 - what are you worried about it's really
205.08 - what it's saying here what are you
205.84 - worried about ex exactly I mean you you
209.24 - but don't jump right to the punch line
211.16 - have a little fun with this so the
213.12 - chance of having a 10% move I mean you
214.96 - can see it's or a 7% move um we're in
218.08 - the zero handle
220.12 - and um well 135 we put all the numbers
224.00 - in front of you the chances of big moves
227.08 - are relatively small mhm but when they
229.68 - happen they're very very painful yep
233.56 - relatively small very very
236.24 - painful um let's go next slide
242.24 - similar to the Spy the qes have also
244.72 - shown a 0% likelihood of experiencing a
247.64 - 57 or 10% move in a single week looking
251.60 - at the past 10 years the q's have an
253.56 - average daily movement of
255.24 - 1.37 compared to 1.11 for
258.80 - spy and you can see the numbers across
261.12 - the board here they look very similar MH
263.84 - hard to hard would be difficult
266.92 - to differentiate between the q's and the
271.60 - spies um but the numbers look kind of
274.36 - pretty basic pretty much across the
276.48 - board the same my take away from this
278.36 - would be the same thing if you know like
281.84 - understand a 10 nobody looks for a 10%
283.64 - move of course I mean nobody plays for
285.80 - it in the
286.68 - snps you know a a 10% move in the snps
290.32 - would be 6,000 points
294.12 - MH that's a lot it's a lot yeah yeah so
297.96 - you're not going to see that a 1% move
299.72 - 60 points we'd be we'd be closed oh we'd
302.56 - be closed we'd be shut down Mark circuit
304.68 - breakers yep let's go to next
308.96 - slide over a longer time frame like 10
311.80 - years ETFs tend to remain stable with
315.24 - the daily moves typically staying
316.72 - between 1 and
319.08 - 2% in contrast individual stocks like
321.88 - Tesla and Nvidia exhibit higher
323.64 - volatility making significant price
325.80 - swings more frequent so now we'll take a
328.28 - look let's go next slide Beth
332.72 - so as a highly liquid and volatile
334.80 - individual stock Tesla we expect to get
337.08 - more daily movement with the average
339.24 - daily move around
340.84 - 4% so the Spy 1.1 The Q's
345.60 - 1.37 and Tesla 4% that's why it's so
350.00 - actively traded because people love
354.12 - trading something that moves around
356.16 - that's why they all have higher implied
357.44 - volatility too monthly implied
358.92 - volatility than you you're going to see
360.08 - in a individual stock then you're going
361.80 - to see in an ETF the probability of
363.68 - experiencing five 7% and 10% movements
367.72 - with a single week still been zero so
371.52 - far but at least one movement of 1% or
374.68 - more per week is relatively High yeah of
376.76 - course um and when you start to look at
380.72 - the numbers here um uh it's they're very
385.52 - different when you start talking about
387.24 - stocks that move 4% a day but the prices
390.44 - also reflect that so when you look at
392.28 - the amount of money that you make or
394.84 - have the potential to make that's why
396.72 - Tony said this morning his best
398.16 - performing stock that's yours Tesla yeah
400.16 - because you can make more money in
402.44 - there or Nvidia or whatever else it is
406.12 - let's go to take a look at the next
407.60 - slide which should be very similar in
410.04 - Nvidia Nvidia has also shown a 0%
412.76 - likelihood of experiencing a a five 7%
415.92 - or 10% movement within a single week and
418.36 - over the past 10 years it's experienced
420.36 - an average daily movement of
422.16 - 3.5% just under what Tesla
425.16 - has and we played out all the numbers
428.00 - for you here so you can
431.64 - see it's very interesting yes it is just
435.12 - you know that that you know you get paid
438.84 - three over three times trading inidia
441.96 - over what over what you wouldn't Des
443.44 - spise because that's how much more um
446.48 - risk you're taking you get paid four
448.08 - times in Tesla over the despise because
450.48 - that's how much more risk you're
452.92 - taking um let's go to the next
458.08 - slide so there is very little
460.20 - probability of having a bunch of large
461.72 - moves back to back according to our
464.12 - study over the past 10 years individual
466.16 - stocks have exhibited more than three
468.48 - times the frequency of large daily
470.08 - movements compared to spy I'm sorry
472.60 - compared to
473.56 - ETFs and since early 2025 we've seen
476.56 - more large Market movements compared to
478.32 - 24 offering profit opportunities to
480.84 - increase liquidity but also posing risks
482.60 - like loss distress margin cause slippage
484.92 - and strong and requiring strong risk
486.88 - management this is all super interesting
