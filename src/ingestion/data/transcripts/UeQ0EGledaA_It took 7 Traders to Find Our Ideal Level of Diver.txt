0.04 - reliability and diversification
1.88 - reliability and diversification let's
3.96 - take a look and see where the research
5.32 - team went on this one today it's a
6.96 - pretty heavy piece SO trading is about
9.28 - accepting R trading is about accepting
11.92 - risk in exchange for probable profits
15.08 - that's okay that's a that's a little bit
16.96 - of a stretch sometimes y perhaps the
19.00 - most long-term successful approach is to
21.12 - diversify using a mixture of assets so
23.48 - these risks offset each other I mean
25.32 - that's one way you can diversify is is
28.08 - underlying another way you can diversify
29.68 - is different strategies another way you
31.44 - get different durations other ways
33.40 - there's a few other things but let's for
35.56 - now focus on just underlines according
38.28 - to probability the risk as literally
40.60 - measured by standard deviation should
42.64 - Reduce by a factor of the square root of
44.44 - the number of independent trades cross
46.60 - underlying correlations can eat into
48.80 - those theoretical advantages so in
50.92 - practice how does trading using a
53.32 - mixture of underlyings compar to
56.04 - sticking to a
57.76 - favorite why do I think this is not not
60.08 - going to be easy um we used 15 years
63.60 - worth of data we used three different
64.96 - underlyings the spy iwm and q's we
67.40 - considered trading 45 days to expiration
69.64 - 16 Delta strangles same as we always do
72.20 - but here's the thing we looked at seven
74.68 - different Traders right paying attention
77.80 - I'm trying to seven different Traders
80.08 - three traded one particular underlying
83.88 - three used a buying power reduction even
87.56 - mixture of two underlyings and and and
91.36 - then they would let's see so for the
94.60 - purposes of the study we imagine
97.00 - fractional contracts were available
98.48 - that's to make it all even and then um
101.92 - sorry three who used a mixture of an
105.56 - even mixture of two
107.40 - underlyings and then one we used a
111.60 - buying power mixture of the three let me
115.48 - see this for a second one used a buying
116.96 - power even mixture of the three the
118.60 - other one used a buying power even
120.16 - mixture of two underlyings okay okay
123.00 - then we just fra we just fractionalized
124.76 - It We examined the buying power results
126.92 - as a percentage of the buying power
128.72 - voted and then we repeated the analysis
130.88 - using 20 30 20 and 30 Delta strangles as
135.36 - well as 50 Delta
138.08 - straddles I'm gonna take the one with
140.28 - three doing the best so there were three
144.40 - traders who used one particular a those
146.48 - are guys they're going to be the losers
148.00 - right I think so there are three traders
151.32 - who
152.40 - used an even mixture of two
155.92 - underlines okay and then there's one
158.52 - Trader who used all three even got that
164.08 - okay kinda kind of John he's kind of got
168.04 - that we're ready for the let's get into
169.88 - the you got
171.24 - it come on this stuff's Child's Play for
173.68 - me right I write this stuff in my sleep
176.44 - um no this all these are hard so first
179.92 - one we're look at is we're going to do
180.96 - the 16 Delta strangle for all of the
184.60 - above um so we have the spy iwm and q's
190.08 - that's that's using that's that's three
193.92 - Traders picking one underline right
196.36 - that's what that is then there's the spy
198.40 - and iwm the spy and q's and this iwm and
201.60 - q's that's the other three Traders using
203.96 - two of the three right okay and then
206.36 - there's the third Trader using all three
209.00 - evenly distri uted and those win
211.44 - percentages they're not because we've
213.32 - been in a bull market for the last 15
214.96 - years those are pretty good mhm the
217.84 - average p&l as a percent of buying power
220.76 - okay I at this point you're not going to
224.12 - get anything out of this study if you
227.60 - look at it just on paper other than the
229.96 - third line down which is the standard
232.48 - deviation which is your p&l divided by
235.48 - the buying power used and what you'll
237.48 - see here is those who use all three had
241.68 - the
242.52 - lowest um amount of risk that's what
245.64 - that column is sure those who used all
248.08 - three also were very at a very low carar
253.16 - but again not the lowest so we're going
256.96 - to go to the to the next one because
258.68 - these are going to be all very similar
259.88 - we don't have to spend a lot of time on
260.88 - this you guys can go back to it later on
262.88 - in the 20 Delta it starts to become a
264.72 - little bit clear and in the 20 Delta
267.24 - which is a bigger strangle you start to
269.24 - see that that when you use all three you
272.12 - had the lowest standard deviation of
275.28 - risk and you had a very high win
279.68 - percentage right okay we go to the next
282.60 - slide and you also have very low searn
285.80 - we're go to the 30 Delta triangle when
287.36 - you see this here you're like okay now
290.24 - this starts to make sense because
291.48 - everybody else's numbers get kind of
293.12 - high but the all three stays low the
296.00 - Diversified portfolios are way better
299.48 - than than the individual portfolios and
302.64 - they have a way lower sear but again the
305.16 - numbers aren't that crazy on all these
307.88 - not that that far off John next slide
311.16 - please so the next one's going to be the
313.24 - straddles when you look at the straddles
315.20 - which is kind of the a little bit
316.88 - towards that maybe the heaviest amount
318.56 - of risk you can see that um the standard
322.36 - deviation which is how much risk are you
325.04 - taking because this is really the only
326.64 - way we can we can break this whole thing
328.80 - down when you talk about risk the lowest
332.44 - amount of risk is when you Diversified
334.16 - into all three the amount of money you
335.88 - made is kind of the same what you would
337.00 - have thought from the very beginning and
338.04 - that's why you asked which is what you
339.32 - would have thought from the very
340.40 - beginning we have six different
341.80 - portfolios up here which are not as
344.36 - Diversified as all three spies iwm Q's
348.00 - they all did okay iwm and spies spy and
352.36 - q's and iwm and q's all of them did okay
356.08 - but the standard deviation was the
358.80 - lowest when you used even distribution
360.96 - of all
362.64 - three it's pretty good pretty good
364.92 - because it's it's just a validation I'm
366.88 - surprised it wasn't
369.20 - more
371.00 - wider you know what I mean mean a bigger
373.76 - difference yeah bigger difference
374.68 - between the two yep surprised maybe if
377.64 - you if you compare it to using any one
380.00 - of the individuals it's pretty big when
381.60 - you compare it to the other two it's
382.72 - kind of not that big MH meaning the the
385.08 - other three the the the mixture of the
388.00 - two it's just marginally better
389.92 - Diversified Traders had significantly
391.72 - lower month-to-month variation in their
394.28 - pnls as well as more mild bad months as
398.20 - represented by sear for example the per
401.96 - buying power reduction risk involved in
403.56 - trading a mixture of three straddles was
405.36 - slightly lower than using a single 30
407.56 - Delta strangle so of course in the end
409.80 - whichever underlying wound up being the
412.08 - most profitable and iwm in this case
414.32 - exclusively was the most overall
416.60 - profitable approach but we don't know
419.08 - which one that'll be beforehand of
420.96 - course sure so unless you have a strong
423.48 - assumption based on underlying using a
425.12 - diversified array of Trades will help
428.32 - you see more consistent results and more
432.68 - and more mild losers help you see
435.56 - clearly saof
