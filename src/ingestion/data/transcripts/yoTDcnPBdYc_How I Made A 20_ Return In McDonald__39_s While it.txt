0.20 - what's up everybody Welcome to the life
2.60 - cycle of a trade the series where we
5.08 - break down the thought process behind
7.44 - trade entry trade adjustments and
10.44 - closing order in this video we are going
13.28 - to cover a call
16.21 - [Music]
19.64 - diagonal all right so we've got a little
21.80 - bit of a pullback in the market but one
23.64 - stock in particular has just been
25.84 - whacked over the in the overnight
28.24 - session here and that is McDonald's
30.00 - there are some eoli news that came out
32.96 - uh the stock is down let's call it 7%
37.08 - right now it was down uh all the way
39.56 - down to like 280 something at some point
42.20 - in the overnight session so it
44.32 - definitely has had a big pullback here
46.88 - it's a relatively low implied volatility
49.20 - underlying most of the time but
51.48 - currently because of this move you could
53.52 - see IV rank getting into the 100 handle
55.84 - over 100 means that it's exceeding its
58.72 - 52- we High
60.68 - uh today right now so it's as high as
63.36 - volatility has been uh I think this is
65.72 - an interesting time to get a little bit
67.08 - of Delta you know be a little contrarian
69.80 - here into this move again 20po move
72.68 - we've erased you know a month and a half
75.32 - two months of price action here even
77.84 - though the stock has had a very
79.48 - significant rally of late um I'm going
82.40 - to look at a called diagonal spread even
84.88 - though again because volatility IV rank
87.44 - is high it doesn't necessarily mean that
89.28 - actual implied volatility is high the
91.52 - actual implied volatility in in
94.24 - McDonald's is actually relatively low
96.36 - when you look at this 20% 24% so it
99.80 - makes getting Delta cheap if something
102.64 - has high implied volatility it's
104.60 - expensive to buy Delta or to get Delta
108.68 - via long premium when volatility is low
111.80 - it's
113.32 - relatively cheaper uh just because of
116.40 - the difference in the volatility here so
119.12 - we're going to look at December let's
121.08 - buy this 300 strike uh it's a it's the
124.40 - first strike out of the money but we've
125.80 - got $5 wide strikes here I'm going
128.16 - closer at the money because I know that
129.72 - this is going to be a relatively cheap
131.40 - call diagonal spread for me relative to
133.92 - the width it's going to used five or six
135.80 - $700 in in in premium here now the high
139.72 - we got to and we could see this here 52e
141.96 - high of 317 let's play for somewhere a
145.04 - little bit under the 52 we High here
147.84 - we'll go to the 310
150.40 - strike for our short option now I'm
153.24 - picking up 18 long Deltas here in a
156.52 - stock that's trading at let's just round
158.28 - it and make it
159.60 - $300 uh so we're getting you know $3,000
163.96 - $4,000 worth of exposure in Delta for
167.76 - just five or 600 bucks so this is a a
171.44 - reflection of of two things first of all
174.04 - you know the leverage that you get with
175.68 - options as well as the low implied
178.28 - volatility here again I said it was
179.84 - cheap to get Delta here it's cheap to
182.24 - get exposure to stock or in effect Delta
186.48 - via this called diagonal spread so stock
189.20 - is rallying here so this spread has
191.24 - moved pretty significantly just to move
193.92 - uh just to show this on a risk profile
195.84 - at expiration is kind of a hard look
198.16 - because these are calendarized I like to
199.96 - go to this Theo this is kind of what our
202.12 - risk profile looks like so uh basically
204.76 - a 5050 shot using the analysis mode here
208.60 - we can actually kind of simulate the
211.00 - passage of time you'll see the risk
213.28 - profile moving that way you can even
215.00 - take out some implied volatility you
217.36 - could take out some from the long option
219.24 - as well so you can see it's got a very
222.04 - interesting uh asymmetric sort of upside
225.28 - to this position and uh as we keep
228.20 - waiting we are missing out on some value
230.44 - here so we'll see if we can get filled
232.12 - at 590 uh 593 here 595 you can see the
236.80 - stock is rallying a little bit it's at
238.72 - 296 now so we'll try at
241.08 - 595 see if we can get filled somewhere
243.48 - around that probably going to have to
245.04 - move it up to 310 that's probably where
246.92 - we'll get filled
248.36 - here through routed it at 310 got it
251.24 - price improved at 604 uh a little bit of
254.32 - long Delta in McDonald's into this dip
256.88 - basically at the high of the session uh
259.24 - this might be a good timing on that
264.20 - trade do have a position that we have to
266.68 - manage today uh one of our winning
269.16 - trades we we had a McDonald's position
271.44 - it was trading at 297 the stock has
273.68 - rallied about3 or $4 from here we had a
276.96 - slightly bullish lean with a called
278.84 - diagonal spread but really A lot of the
280.68 - value has come from this short option
283.64 - that we sold uh in the November monthly
286.56 - expiration at the 310 strike we can go
288.64 - and look at that here uh just to give
290.76 - you an idea it's trading at about 35
292.76 - cents is right here when we put this
295.40 - trade on was trading at about $4 and
298.36 - that that's come from time Decay changes
301.56 - implied volatility volatility has come
303.16 - in significantly after that big drop uh
305.96 - so we've gained about $3 almost $4 in
309.60 - value out of that option that option we
311.28 - sold at 390 is now trading at 30 so uh
315.84 - with that position the long option has
319.60 - only come in about $2 even though the
321.92 - stock has gone basically nowhere so we
324.08 - we bought it at 10 and it's now trading
326.76 - at$ 759 so we've lost $2.50 from the
330.08 - long option we've gained almost $3
335.32 - $3.50 on that short option so most of
338.20 - the value came from the short option so
342.60 - that value is what is giving us this
344.88 - profit potential selling out of the
346.64 - December call buying back the November
349.60 - position
351.76 - here 730 we got filled about 2 cents
354.64 - above the mid price closing that one out
356.64 - for $126 profit about uh let's called
359.88 - 20% return on Capital 30% there so nice
363.08 - little trade over about a 3 week time
366.20 - frame
