0.32 - welcome to option trades today I'm toy
2.36 - the Baptista and I have a trade idea for
3.96 - you today November 19th that's right
7.68 - 2024 but first as I always do let's see
10.44 - what the Market's doing &ps are up $2
13.96 - doesn't seem like anything's happening
15.32 - today but you can see here from the high
17.08 - low which I like to have on here where
19.36 - the &ps are basically unchanged you can
22.36 - see that they were about 70 handles
24.44 - lower and 10 handles higher big range on
28.48 - the &ps we opened much lower than this
31.36 - went lower after some numbers and have
33.12 - rallied back since then Nasdaq doing the
35.36 - same up 44 Russell up 50 and the Dow is
39.92 - the weakest of the group down
42.88 - $165 volatility still up 30 when I woke
46.36 - up this morning with the &ps down around
49.80 - $20 uh volatility was up 90 cents uh
52.84 - volatility been staying bid all day long
56.08 - maybe that's because of some economic
57.48 - news that we have coming out later in
59.48 - this week but right now the market seems
61.24 - to be uh churning itself a little bit
63.72 - higher like I always like to do and
65.92 - bonds by the way caught a little bit of
67.20 - a bid they got to
68.84 - 11713 wiping out the last three or four
71.36 - days lower move but still plenty of room
74.20 - to the upside if you're bullish plenty
76.24 - of reasons to sell them if you're
77.40 - bearish too let's take a look at what I
80.28 - like to do I like to go to my watch list
82.56 - I like to go to High option volume list
85.08 - I like to change this from ivx 5day
89.04 - change this the implied volatility
91.76 - change um of each products individual
95.96 - implied volatility this IV rank would be
98.80 - going higher as these numbers would be
100.96 - going Greener you'll notice here that
103.32 - here's where the earnings are I like to
105.36 - get rid of those earnings too by just
107.40 - clicking on earnings and now I have all
109.80 - the stocks without earnings in this list
112.68 - at the top of the list one of the stocks
115.24 - that I want to trade today and for
116.92 - different reasons not because it has
118.96 - high uh premium but because volatility
121.80 - has expanded ever so slightly but it
124.32 - does have a very low Ivy rank this is
126.88 - kind of the setup what I was looking at
129.12 - in meta uh when I traded meta relatively
132.44 - high price stock
134.32 - $413 out of the reach for most people
136.60 - for naked options it would take 7 to
138.80 - 8,000 for a naked option depending on
141.16 - where you're going there if you're going
142.12 - to do some sort of strangle I like to
144.08 - keep my buying power wrapped around
145.48 - $5,000 so it makes it a little bit more
147.88 - expensive plus it doesn't have a high
150.20 - rank for me to be selling premium in
152.32 - here I like to use some sort of calendar
154.76 - or diagonal spread that's what I did
156.88 - with meta that's a $550 stock I got the
159.76 - move wrong for a day or two took one day
162.44 - of getting the move right I was able to
164.24 - take a buck on that trade pretty uh
166.12 - quickly I'm looking to do that same type
168.56 - of trade in Microsoft here today low Ivy
172.36 - rank high price stock usually out of the
175.48 - reach of most people in a uh IRA account
178.60 - it might take 50 6 $60,000 to do a naked
182.16 - option you're going to have to do
183.92 - something with some defined risk so I
185.88 - like to go around 45 days you could
189.36 - certainly make an argument that December
191.64 - options with 31 days that's 14 days away
194.28 - from uh 45 days would be the options to
197.12 - go to you certainly can make an option
199.20 - for uh uh a discussion for January uh
202.80 - closest to 45 days also 14 days away
206.84 - from 45 days so let's use them both what
209.88 - I'm going to do here is I'm going to do
211.56 - a directional trade I'm looking at
213.88 - Microsoft that has a high correlation to
216.08 - the market you can see here volatil has
218.04 - been expanding a little bit uh as you
219.92 - noticed on the ivy rank 5day change that
222.88 - I showed you um uh Netflix has been on
226.00 - its butt kind of uh not cooperating with
228.32 - the overall Market although it does have
230.16 - a correlation of 73% now you can get
233.60 - correlations in the watch list if you
235.32 - want to or you can look on the right
237.08 - hand gutter of tasty trade that I don't
239.28 - have up here on the platform because it
240.64 - would take up too much room but you
242.96 - certainly could look there you look for
244.88 - C RR that's correlation uh correlation
248.24 - to the S&P 500 Microsoft has a 73 now
251.68 - you will notice over the try to take a a
253.88 - little bit of a blow up on this you will
255.64 - notice over the last four or five days
257.68 - it has moved with the &ps going lower
261.40 - but &ps are coming off of highs just
263.76 - four or five days ago NASDAQ which the
266.32 - Microsoft is also in been going down the
268.72 - last six or seven days days but it too
271.20 - is coming off of highs uh Microsoft on
274.32 - the other hand um is not coming off off
277.48 - anywhere near highs so I think the
279.80 - stocks a little bit beat up maybe they
281.40 - come for well I hate to call Microsoft a
283.44 - pig but maybe they come for the pigs for
285.28 - the end of the year so what am I doing
286.72 - in January I'm looking to buy an in the
289.36 - money option and you notice here there's
291.00 - plenty of volume in the options I have
292.64 - that here I'm going to change it right
293.96 - now um from uh in the money percentage
297.48 - to Delta to let's go to open interest
299.88 - just to show you a little bit more
300.88 - plenty of open interest even though the
302.64 - markets are 10 cents wide maybe a little
304.72 - bit uh tighter as you get a little lower
306.88 - fills are usually filled at Mid price
309.52 - Penny or two above or below I like to go
312.48 - to somewhere around the 60 or 70 Delta
314.72 - option to get my uh long premium fund
317.84 - from I'm going to go to the 60 Delta
319.64 - option here with 59 days I'm going to go
322.16 - to the 405 calls in January I'm going to
325.24 - look to buy one of those what am I going
327.28 - to do I'm going to look to sell
328.76 - something in December well if I'm
330.24 - looking to sell something in December
331.52 - and buy something in January I want the
334.56 - monthly implied volatility to be no
337.36 - greater than two full points so right
341.40 - now I have a 22% implied volatility in
344.20 - December and I have a
346.68 - 22.2% volatility in January that I'm
349.40 - buying not this 2% but a full 2% so for
353.32 - me not to make this trade December
355.76 - volatility would have to be 22 and
358.44 - January volatility would be be closer to
360.56 - 24 or 25 and then I would not look to
363.80 - make this trade I like to have
366.04 - volatility uh expand in January
368.88 - hopefully as time goes by and this has
371.56 - Theta Decay faster Theta Decay because
373.52 - there's less time for these options so
376.20 - in December I'm going to look to keep my
378.04 - mechanics the same I'm going to look to
379.68 - sell an option that's out of the money
381.64 - it wouldn't matter to me if you did the
383.20 - 420 the 417 or the 415 either um to
388.24 - create a small or as big a delta or
391.08 - diagonal as you want you'll notice that
392.56 - the 415 uh option if you sell here is
395.40 - going to be a little bit cheaper price
397.08 - than the one that I did you're going to
399.28 - see here that it has 11 and a half long
402.20 - Deltas it's got 15 long deltas and in
406.12 - the 20s it has uh 19 long Deltas that's
410.44 - where I went with this trade I got
412.12 - filled at $3 and3 when the stock was
416.20 - trading about 60 cents lower than where
419.84 - is right now why am I looking at this
422.04 - type of trade it has an embedded $15
425.16 - wide diagonal long spread in it meaning
429.08 - this is a bullish strategy make no bones
431.96 - about it it has almost 20 long Deltas
434.44 - but yet I'm getting paid 200 I'm sorry
438.76 - $22.76 for that
441.12 - $1,300 in risk that I have on this trade
445.48 - that's my Max risk on this trade $1,300
449.28 - to typically a lot smaller than the
451.40 - trade that I make with a lot bigger
454.00 - Delta that I make that's something
455.88 - Dynamic that you can get here um by
458.20 - trading calendar and trading different
460.48 - types of spreads using options you'll
462.36 - notice there's no pop on here no
464.16 - probability profit although you can go
466.20 - into the analyze Tab and mess around
469.00 - with the different volatilities of each
471.28 - month that you're long or short to see
473.36 - what will happen here the reason why
475.48 - there's no pop on this trade is you
477.92 - cannot
479.56 - anyway accurately predict what the
482.40 - volatility is going to be in December
484.32 - and what the volatility is going to be
485.84 - in January nor can you predict what the
488.80 - volatility between the two or more
491.12 - importantly between the two is going to
493.44 - be so really what you have to look at is
495.92 - here is the Delta on the position it's a
498.44 - 20 Delta long position in Microsoft that
502.72 - has not cooperated or has not
504.88 - participated with the overall Market at
507.84 - all so I'm looking at at this to catch a
510.44 - falling knife in Microsoft in a defined
513.32 - risk trade uh that has a relatively high
516.52 - probability of profit I'll put it above
519.32 - 60 uh on that that probability profit
522.44 - because that's because it has a a
523.96 - positive Theta Decay on the overall
525.48 - position but you know what go into the
527.16 - analyze tab play around in there doesn't
529.96 - cost you a dime to do it and see how it
532.32 - moves as volatility goes up and
534.28 - volatility goes down I will just quickly
536.68 - show you if you come down here to the
539.04 - follow page and you click on Bob the
541.72 - trader that's me you'll see here um my
545.04 - meta position in here somewhere I'll
546.96 - just do it this way for you because I
548.80 - couldn't see it
551.40 - me the last time we put on this position
553.80 - was on the seventh we were able to take
555.24 - it off on the 11th and I made almost a
557.36 - buck and you'll notice that the ivr
558.92 - actually expanded a little bit and the
561.08 - stock actually um you'll notice here
563.92 - that this was a put uh diagonal I was
566.92 - getting bearish in I sorry I think I
568.64 - said bullish in the beginning of mind
570.28 - the stock actually cooperated by $8 and
573.20 - I was able to make a buck on that trade
575.36 - let's hope that in
577.36 - Microsoft uh Microsoft cooperates by
579.96 - that same $ eight you'll see here I made
581.96 - this trade earlier today you can see
583.88 - those trades immediately when I make
585.36 - them on the tasty trade platform if you
587.92 - open Move transfer aat transfer bring to
591.08 - your account to tasty trade to take
593.20 - advantage of some of the great benefits
595.16 - they have here but you'll notice I wrote
596.76 - a long Delta diagonal and a highly
598.92 - correl
599.96 - low ivr stock expecting volatility to
602.92 - expand it does have earnings January
605.40 - 19th which is after the January
608.60 - expiration here so we won't benefit from
611.16 - that but maybe we'll get a little bit of
612.64 - a boost uh with two days before uh uh
616.72 - before earnings coming out being long
618.68 - that option all right I'm Tony the bat
621.32 - Batista I appreciate all of your support
