0.28 - what's up everybody Welcome to the life
2.68 - cycle of a trade the series where we
5.12 - break down the thought process behind
7.48 - trade entry trade adjustments and
10.48 - closing order in this video we are going
13.36 - to cover a naked
16.21 - [Music]
21.16 - put what's up everyone we're going to
23.44 - make a couple trades here for the Johnny
24.96 - Trader portfolio I like to go to the S&P
28.28 - 100 list just to see what's moving you
30.16 - can see a lot of the chip names to the
32.16 - upside on the downside it's a little bit
34.32 - of a mixed bag you got some of the um
36.72 - payment processors MasterCard Visa you
39.08 - got Target on there cat uh Adobe FedEx
43.32 - um looking for a couple positions here
45.68 - in this portfolio I'm trying to find
48.08 - some stocks that are in the 50 to $100
51.52 - range so that I can sell some naked
53.56 - premium here with our expirations now
56.00 - currently around that 30 to 40-day time
58.84 - frame um so one of the names that came
61.28 - up in my search was Shopify uh shop
64.56 - trading currently at 66 you got an iv
67.08 - rank of 69 so very high there uh it's
70.12 - traded pretty range bound over the last
72.56 - couple weeks it's had the a pretty wide
74.80 - range over the last um couple months
78.12 - here and into the last year but it's
81.00 - trading at kind of the lower end of
82.60 - where it's been been trading so I'm
84.20 - going to look to do uh naked put here in
86.76 - Shopify so we'll go to the August
90.08 - expiration it does have earnings coming
92.04 - up somewhere within the expiration which
94.16 - I'm okay with given that um pretty much
97.80 - everything has earnings coming up so I'm
100.40 - going to go to the August expiration
102.28 - here I'd like to go somewhere around the
104.56 - 20 to 30 Delta for my short puts so
107.36 - looking at this strike it'd be the 60 UH
110.72 - 60 strike put trading at $2 and change
113.48 - it uses about 700 bucks in buying power
116.32 - so it's at the higher end of my my
118.32 - typical range uh but I'm okay with that
120.92 - given that I've got a lot of capital on
123.40 - the sidelines right now so I'm GNA look
125.56 - at this naked put here about a 25 26 27
130.20 - Delta here very high Theta Max profit of
132.88 - $2 and change which is my credit using
135.60 - about 700 bucks in buying power I'll
137.56 - look to manage this trade $50 to $100
139.96 - profit would be my ideal range here over
142.36 - the next couple weeks so we'll put this
144.68 - order in at 212 here right at the mid
147.08 - price see if we get filled
150.28 - there we
153.96 - are what's up everyone we are back with
156.76 - a closing order on a shop naked put that
159.44 - we put on just last week here on the
162.76 - 10th you can see on the right side of
165.08 - the platform here when we look at the
166.56 - order chains we can see we sold this on
170.12 - uh July 10th we sold it at
172.52 - $212 if we right click you can pull up
175.60 - The View Market snapshots just to give
177.48 - you an idea of where we sold that put we
179.92 - sold the put when the stock was trading
181.36 - at 66 it's now trading at 69 so it's at
184.20 - about a five
185.76 - or6 uh price movement to the upside
188.96 - which is great IV rank has actually
191.92 - expanded into this up move we can look
194.36 - at uh the Delta of the option was about
196.88 - a 26 Delta at that time uh we've had
199.92 - this nice little rally here and this
201.56 - option has gone from $212 down to to
205.36 - a149 so it's about a uh marked $63
209.48 - profit
210.52 - just about 30 40% of the max profit here
214.60 - in just under a week so I think it's
217.00 - time to close this trade out we'll go
219.92 - and open up the August expiration we can
222.36 - see the Delta we've lost about eight
224.80 - Deltas on this trade because of this up
226.88 - move uh that's why the option is much
229.64 - cheaper right now so we go to buy the
232.56 - option we would click the ask which is
234.52 - to buy the option that we are short here
238.48 - we've got it here at a do 50 is the mid
241.52 - price uh the 60 strike put if we get
244.00 - filled here it' be a $62 profit see if
246.92 - we can get
249.52 - filled there it is a $150 closing order
253.32 - on that short naked put nice move in the
255.92 - stock which helped us significantly here
258.80 - uh $62 about 30% of the max profit on
263.08 - just a couple 100 bucks in buying power
264.84 - so nice return on Capital there another
