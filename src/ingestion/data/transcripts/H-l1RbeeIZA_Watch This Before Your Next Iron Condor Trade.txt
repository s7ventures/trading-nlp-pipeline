0.08 - let's see what to consider before
1.92 - putting on iron Condors let's let's go
3.64 - to the next slide so yesterday we
5.56 - explored the optimization of wing width
7.76 - and buying power requirements using
10.08 - neutral strategies like the strangle and
11.52 - iron Condor following this study we
14.04 - received inquiries on how to easily
16.40 - demonstrate the advantages of widening
18.08 - Wing widths compared to narrower wings
21.92 - with present lower risk which present
24.44 - lower risk for novice and and limited
27.12 - account sized um Traders so in response
31.00 - we compiled statistics to highlight
33.00 - additional reasons behind all that
35.92 - discussion that we had yesterday okay
38.20 - it's important to mention that when
39.40 - setting up an iron Condor we have
41.20 - multiple choices select such as
43.36 - selecting the strikes to sell the
45.28 - contracts to use and the width of the
48.16 - Wings let's go let's take a look let's
51.24 - break it
53.32 - down typical for us we go 45 days to
56.40 - expiration we manage 21 days even though
58.52 - it's an iron condor
60.56 - we used 10 years of data and we looked
63.96 - at varying widths three um uh three
67.68 - strikes wide five strikes wide
70.92 - 10 oh there's your bond bonds 28 look at
74.12 - you 3510 and 13 strikes wide we compared
78.24 - the win rate the SAR the buying power
81.64 - the return on Capital and the cumulative
83.40 - performance of the average p&l we
86.96 - basically broke it all down mhm so what
89.12 - to consider before for executing an iron
91.00 - Condor um what Tony and I like to do is
93.68 - we're kind of middle of the road iron
95.24 - Condor players what that means is we
98.08 - definitely don't do them too tight and
99.60 - we definitely don't do them too crazy
101.24 - wide so like we're kind of in the middle
103.28 - somewhere so if I had to say what are we
105.96 - we're probably the five to 10
110.16 - Range Five would be pretty tight I think
112.44 - we're more the $10 range but sure I
114.88 - think a lot of the NASDAQ stocks that we
116.48 - end up trading or higher price stocks um
120.20 - and that's why you go to a $10 wide okay
122.28 - let's go next slide okay so say we're
124.76 - five or 10 yep and Y but we we kind of
128.24 - don't do the I mean we're mostly
129.92 - strangles we don't do the 13 Delta wide
132.08 - we rarely do the three Delta Wide Wings
135.28 - right um and the 20 Deltas for the short
138.20 - strike is probably pretty good for us 20
139.76 - 25 so the wider the wings the more
142.12 - closely the performance mimics the same
144.04 - Delta strangle the tighter the wings the
146.28 - less the win rate the less premium
147.64 - collected also the less buying power
149.04 - used and this is all like something that
152.40 - shouldn't surprise you but you can see
153.92 - where we are here at those 10 Delta
155.84 - Wings we're kind of right in that you
159.08 - know 61 verse 71 and you can see our
163.60 - numbers are about half of you know what
166.20 - we would take in premium wise and the
168.64 - buying power is I don't know 1/4 MH
172.28 - about 25% we usually figure back of the
174.96 - envelope we say between 20 and
177.00 - 25% that's the back of the envelope if
179.40 - you're only only taking in like like
182.96 - like if you're doing three Deltas wise
184.76 - you're doing using $300 forsus 6,000 in
187.36 - a strangle so it's 20 to1 that's that's
190.20 - only 5% that's that's way too narrow
194.16 - sure if you're doing about 20 to
197.04 - 25% which would be you know which is
200.64 - something like around the 10 Delta um
203.04 - that's okay like I to me that makes a
206.44 - lot more
207.60 - sense um and that's where we like to be
209.60 - on most of our defined wrrs so we don't
212.12 - want to be it's not like one 12th we
214.52 - want to use maybe one quarter
217.88 - 1th that's our back the envelope kind of
221.04 - an idea that that we're kind of
222.52 - collecting enough premium let's go to
224.96 - next
226.40 - slide I also don't like that 52% win
229.20 - rate you know in the cheapies right
230.76 - you'd rather be in the in the 60s right
233.24 - the Cuma of pnl over time provides an
237.04 - overview of how the varying Wing widths
239.04 - perform over the same period using um
242.96 - the iron Condor strategy and you can see
246.16 - here there's two there's two of those
249.24 - lines below zero and there's no real
253.56 - reason using the snps and managing at 21
255.92 - days over 10e period why you would ever
258.84 - want to do something that ends up to be
262.20 - has a negative return it's below the
264.72 - zero line the 10 Delta 13 Delta have a
267.84 - positive return that's your answer I
269.52 - mean you don't have to go any further
271.24 - than that that this is I mean some of
273.28 - those have those are pretty consistently
276.40 - below the zero line and the other ones
278.16 - are pretty consistently above except if
280.36 - you take you know the pandemic really
281.96 - dragged down the averages but still The
284.84 - Wider you go the better off you've been
287.40 - let's go next slide and those are
289.40 - cumulative pnls okay even though the
291.92 - tight iron Condors exhibit a lower risk
294.04 - profile um as shown by the sear and the
296.80 - worst loss the worst case loss metrics
299.96 - they may lead to negative Returns on
302.20 - buying power and capital deployed over
304.80 - time um
308.04 - there's there's clearly okay now again
311.72 - this is these are cumulative over time
315.48 - so it's a little different than the way
316.96 - you would really look at anything in a
319.32 - more traditional you know you don't look
320.96 - necessarily cumul over time but but
322.72 - still um you can see the three and five
325.28 - and the other ones were just small
327.20 - positive and the strangle was the most
328.56 - positive that's why like undefined risk
330.68 - the best but we tend to stay in that 10
333.08 - Delta maybe we even go further maybe go
334.72 - a little bit higher but based on this
336.60 - study um the worst losses
339.88 - are feel like they're in line with
342.48 - everything else and the C I feel like is
344.16 - in line um I don't think those are none
346.92 - of those numbers are crazy I think
348.24 - they're just what you would expect but I
351.12 - think the takeaway from the segment is
352.80 - you want to stay away with from from
355.28 - Delta widths and from the narrow width
357.20 - iron Condors where the long-term C of
359.88 - p&l is a negative
361.64 - number I know it's attractive to not
364.16 - have to put up much money I know it's
365.96 - attractive to have the low C and the
367.60 - small buying power doesn't work if you
370.36 - hit one out great but so although tight
373.20 - iron Condors require less buying power
375.40 - they're low average p&l their negative
377.20 - return on Capital and their win rates
378.76 - just don't justify consistent use you
381.40 - want to do it on a one-off basis go
382.92 - ahead but consistently if we increase
385.80 - the wings the trades more closely
387.20 - replicate the performance of a strangle
389.88 - while using much less buying power than
392.36 - a strength so is it is it exactly no
395.76 - it's not you pay for the right to Define
398.16 - your risk you pay for the right to limit
400.88 - your risk you pay for the right to use
404.32 - less Capital it's expensive but
