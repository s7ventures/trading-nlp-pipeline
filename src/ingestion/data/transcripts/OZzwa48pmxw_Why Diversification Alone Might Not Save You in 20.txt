0.12 - the probability of compounding losses
3.16 - and IV correlation on the first slide
5.72 - here we're just going to show the snps
7.48 - in green and then we're just showing
9.20 - some other you know we're giving you TLT
11.40 - and gold and just showing you kind of
12.84 - like you know how things are all over
14.92 - the place no no Rhyme or Reason so
16.72 - here's where we start to get into kind
18.12 - of the the the guts of this discussion
21.76 - today and the purpose of the discussion
25.84 - is really to show you kind of how
29.24 - important it is is to stay and how
31.92 - important it is to stay where you're not
33.84 - where you don't have all your eggs in
35.08 - the same basket because things tend to
39.44 - move together especially in down moves
43.04 - yep so now we never have down moves so
46.20 - that confuses everybody because we only
47.68 - go up but someday we might not just go
50.32 - up and if that happens that's why this
52.68 - is good research so on average prices
55.16 - for for snps gold and bonds have a
59.20 - fairly low positive correlation or they
61.68 - have a moderate inverse correlation like
64.08 - bonds and stocks are moderate inverse
65.88 - correlation gold and stocks have a
68.36 - moderate positive correlation none of
70.56 - those are statistically significant you
72.88 - know negative .29 or Z
76.32 - or6 those are not those are aren't
78.84 - anything that's with price with implied
81.80 - volatility they're moderately correlated
84.24 - meaning more so than the more so than
86.16 - price right because Gold Bond
90.44 - snps you know they have a higher
92.40 - correlation than price right and um
97.40 - because fear is not something you know
100.28 - fear doesn't really know
102.56 - so so so so that's the first takeaway
105.72 - let's go next slide and this is the last
107.44 - like eight years so the next thing we
108.96 - look at is the trend becomes even more
110.48 - prominent during unexpected Market
112.64 - turbulence such as February of a c
115.44 - February March of a couple years ago so
117.60 - we went back and we looked at Price back
119.92 - in 2020 during the pandemic and the gold
124.04 - price and the TLT price were still you
127.20 - know there was virtually no correlation
129.08 - but the implied volatility was much
131.28 - higher and so meaning that fear in snps
134.32 - and fear in bonds and fear in gold was
136.32 - all close to they were all close to the
138.24 - same what we're going to do is we're
139.36 - going to use that information to dive
140.84 - further into this by looking how it how
143.92 - how lucky it is or How likely it is for
146.36 - spy strangles and TLT strangles to incur
148.44 - large losses
150.68 - simultaneously what happens when things
152.88 - get ugly so we looked at bonds and we
155.32 - looked at S&P and we looked at 13 years
158.28 - we did the typical 16 Delta strangle 45
160.96 - days to expiration manag 21 days and we
163.36 - calculated How likely it was for each
164.76 - strategy to have a loss more than um
168.24 - half one half X 1X 2x or 3x of the
172.76 - initial credit so the initial credit
174.72 - let's say was $5 one half would be you
178.04 - know 250 one would be 250 50 I'm sorry
180.76 - one would be $5 and two would be $10 on
183.48 - top of the original five yep so so that
187.52 - means like if we sold something at five
188.92 - we buy back at $750 $10 or you know 2x
191.92 - would be
192.84 - 20 given that the Spy strangle
197.52 - losses um were more we calculate the
201.72 - probability that TLT losses would have
204.24 - would also be more for each of the
206.52 - losses listed above let's take a look
208.44 - the probability of a loss worse then so
211.44 - again this is where it gets kind of
212.88 - really interesting TLT strangles tend to
215.96 - reach two to three times losses more
217.52 - often than spy strangles since their
219.44 - initial credit tends to be lower however
222.12 - overall it's fairly rare for spy and
225.44 - ttlt losses there strangles to incur
228.68 - losses particularly large ones so for
231.52 - example spy strangles and TLT strangles
233.40 - have lost more than 2x the initial
235.52 - credit 6 and 9% of the time respectively
238.80 - which is quite small what we showed here
242.28 - is the probability of a loss worse you
245.28 - know worse than one half one half the
249.16 - time one half the credit or one time the
251.40 - credit is something that is I don't know
255.32 - fairly manageable sure sure fairly
258.24 - manageable for sure I mean if you're
261.24 - winning a high percentage of the time
263.36 - and losing you know you sell something
265.52 - for $5 you have to buy it back for $10
268.24 - it's and it's only10 or 133% of the time
270.80 - it's not that bad or at least I wouldn't
272.20 - think it's that bad however the
275.04 - conditional probability of a loss of a
277.48 - 2X loss is much higher let's see what
279.80 - that means given that the Spy strangle
281.88 - incurred a loss worse than two times
284.64 - initial loss the Spy strangle also had a
286.60 - loss worse than 2x nearly 30% of the
289.88 - time so what they're saying is that that
293.48 - together H that was not not that good so
297.04 - not ideal no I wouldn't say that was
298.84 - ideal Additionally the more severe the
301.20 - loss of the Spy strangle the more likely
303.28 - it was for the TLT strangle to have a
305.88 - similar large loss by
308.68 - expiration so the probability of a TLT
312.80 - strangle loss worse than
315.20 - a worse than the the original loss given
318.96 - the Spy loss was worse than the original
321.92 - loss um projection was actually a little
326.36 - higher than we thought it was almost it
329.52 - was 27% just under 30% so as an
334.16 - individual stock it was like 133% but
337.68 - together was like 27% okay that's that's
341.04 - kind of high all right let's see where
343.20 - they're going with this I think they're
345.52 - I think the takeaway is that that you
348.96 - need to stay small in order to protect
351.92 - yourself but let's
353.72 - see let's go next slide so this trend is
357.00 - due to the fact that both these
357.92 - underlyings tend to become more volatile
360.20 - when the um when Market volatility is
363.28 - higher as a result simultaneous large
366.00 - losses are more likely when the market
368.12 - becomes more
369.24 - volatile this is why position size
371.64 - management is so important I think
373.80 - that's a good point so on the takeaway
376.40 - slide what what the team is saying is
378.32 - that implied voles across different
379.76 - underlyings show stronger positive
381.88 - correlations than their prices
383.88 - especially during Market sell-offs
386.00 - highlighting the limits of
387.08 - diversification in protecting short
388.76 - option portfolio from broad volatility
391.32 - spikes so diversification alone cannot
393.96 - Shield against market-wide volatility
396.16 - expansions that affect multiple
398.16 - positions simultaneously that's why
400.40 - there's sometimes you just look at your
401.52 - positions you're like oh crap you know
404.08 - there's like kind of nothing everything
405.40 - everything seems to move in tandem
406.96 - anyway now it might move to a little
408.68 - lesser degree something might be up 1%
410.60 - something might only be up a quarter
411.96 - percent I mean it's very hard to find
414.24 - yeah that that unicorn of a of a you
417.48 - know uncorrelated portfolio so in a
420.56 - study while large losses on spy and TLT
423.16 - were rare a significant loss in spy
426.04 - often coincided with a similar loss in
428.08 - TLT even though they weren't correlated
430.76 - right particularly though as Market
432.36 - volatility increased again and here's
435.12 - the biggest takeaway to this
436.88 - underscoring the need for careful
438.76 - position sizing I have heard so many
441.20 - people tell I've listen to so many
444.44 - different people that don't understand
445.72 - how markets work talk about listen as
448.72 - long as your divers I ified you're fine
450.92 - as long as you're this or that as long
452.88 - as you put in a stop order as long as
454.44 - you do this or that you're fine the
456.40 - reality is that is not the case the way
459.60 - to defend yourself keep your positions
461.56 - small that's it yeah Piggyback in that
464.16 - confirm and send about crypto and
465.56 - everything else like that it really does
466.92 - come down to sizing that's it anytime
469.16 - I've ever got in trouble it's always
470.24 - been too big never too small anyway
472.12 - that's it yep good
