0.20 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.36 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
3.92 - you today November 5th
6.92 - 2024 it's election day but first let's
10.32 - see what's going on with the market well
12.12 - let me tell you something &ps are having
14.68 - quite a day they are quite strong &ps
18.04 - are up
21.00 - $49.50 NASDAQ up 209 they're both just
25.32 - off of their highs Russell up 17 and
28.04 - change and the Dow Up 3 00 it's an
30.92 - allout rally in the market volatility
34.04 - down by 107 giving a lot of support to
37.76 - this rally in the market uh volatility
41.16 - down $5 uh sorry down five and a half%
44.56 - down a dollar five right now bonds
47.28 - continue to be weaker down by 15 as
50.44 - bonds go lower rates go higher and the
53.80 - FED is supposed to come out tomorrow and
55.60 - talk about well reducing interest rates
58.88 - I don't know how they're going do that
61.04 - in this market that we have something's
63.12 - got to give you MEPS have to go lower or
65.48 - bonds have to go higher but this can't
67.56 - stay right now the way things have been
69.68 - going but all that means nothing to me
72.04 - because I'm going to go into the equity
73.72 - world I like to go to the high option
75.72 - volume list and I like to click on my
77.92 - earnings so I have no earnings on the
80.44 - right hand side here I don't want to
82.52 - trade any of those stocks that have
85.24 - earnings for me I like to avoid these
87.96 - stocks that have earnings a stock that
89.72 - came came up to me would be Tesla Tesla
93.04 - sitting here with an ivy rank of 44
95.56 - let's find it on my list here you'll see
97.88 - that Tesla up
99.92 - $866 today leading the NASDAQ higher is
103.16 - trading at
104.48 - $251 it's had a decent range today of
107.36 - almost $7 but look at this the ivx 5day
111.12 - change that's the implied volatility of
114.52 - the options over the last 5 days has
116.92 - been rallying as volatility has been
120.04 - going lower with an ivvy rank of 44 and
124.12 - no earnings great markets this is a
127.92 - stock that just calls my name what are
130.52 - we going to do in here well I'm going to
132.16 - go nice and wide in here I'm going to go
135.04 - far out to the outer reaches I'm going
138.12 - to go to December options with 45 days
141.68 - 45 days being optimal at least from our
144.96 - research on opening trades I'm going to
147.32 - go to December again earning are not
150.36 - until January 22nd this is a post
153.16 - earnings trade they've already had their
154.68 - earnings I'm going to go all the way
156.48 - down to the 200 put the 200 put with a
160.52 - 10 Delta is trading around
164.40 - $260 I'm going to go all the way up to
167.92 - the
168.88 - 335 calls again approximately the same
173.00 - Delta I could go to the 330s you
175.24 - certainly could I just happened to go to
177.60 - the to the 335s when I looked at this
180.36 - trade that was the 10 Delta option it
182.72 - gives me basically no Delta but as you
184.88 - can see one long Delta here my
188.40 - probability of profit is
190.60 - 83% my Theta Decay how much should this
193.68 - go down all things being equal if that
196.24 - volatility does not expand per day about
199.68 - $19 a day my Max profit is the credit I
203.44 - received
204.92 - $465 and you can do this better than me
207.84 - because I did it at 400 and
211.72 - $61 uh your max loss they say is
214.48 - infinite but look at these dotted lines
217.24 - this is the one standard deviation line
219.80 - just above 300 and this is the one
222.24 - standard Dev deviation line uh just
225.16 - below 205 I'm outside of one standard
228.96 - deviation that's why my probably a
231.24 - profit even though I'm selling both
232.88 - sides is
234.52 - 83% the buying power effect is
238.12 - $5,000 on almost almost
241.04 - $465 if you get filled at Mid price here
244.00 - or even if you get filled on the bid at
245.68 - 462 or 463 I did it at 461 let's take a
250.40 - look at this your break evens are just
252.92 - above
254.32 - 195 and your break even is just below
258.28 - 340 let's see over the last 45 days has
262.12 - has Tesla been any higher than that no
264.12 - it has not has it been any lower than
266.36 - that no it has not so I'm outside the
269.16 - expected move I'm outside the recent
271.24 - range all I want Tesla to do is
273.88 - cooperate and by cooperate I want it to
276.44 - have its $35 expected move over the next
280.20 - 45 days I am well outside of that range
284.32 - this is a
285.76 - relatively um high probability trade but
289.16 - of course there's always the risk of the
291.68 - stock moving higher or lower and
293.92 - changing my overall Delta so what would
296.20 - I want to do well every time this Delta
300.12 - right here gets to plus or minus 15 I
303.68 - roll down the untested side meaning if I
307.04 - was getting positive 15 Delta meaning
311.00 - the stock was going lower I would move
313.92 - this call down until I increased my
317.76 - short Delta by seven or eight meaning
321.36 - that I would have only seven or eight
323.88 - long Deltas left with the stock going
326.68 - higher I remove I remove the Delta risk
329.88 - when my Delta gets to plus or minus 15
333.68 - right here on the screen or on your
336.44 - position tab hey it's an advantage that
339.04 - you're watching this video now because
341.48 - like I told you a moment ago if you go
