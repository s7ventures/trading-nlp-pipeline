0.04 - we're calling this one breaking the
1.52 - volatility code speed matters more than
6.32 - size let's see where the team's going
8.56 - with this
10.36 - one so recently we've seen certain
12.96 - stocks we're going to as an example
14.96 - today we're going to use Nvidia make
16.96 - some huge outlier moves these types of
19.68 - moves are generally bad for short
21.84 - premium trades and of of course they are
25.20 - you know when when a stock like Nvidia
27.96 - drops from near 15 50 to near
31.36 - 120 it's pretty hard to defend that move
35.80 - of $30 when the expected move over that
38.12 - period of time it's closer to 15 you
40.92 - know that's the challenge two times the
42.48 - expected move and as you can see on the
44.36 - right hand slide there you know the
46.68 - volatility in Nvidia just popped up and
49.76 - so you have a double whammy going on
51.84 - stock moving outside the expected move
54.28 - and volatility expanding and when you're
55.80 - short premium uh no bueno on that little
59.56 - combin
60.64 - there that's where you get that's where
62.60 - I get into trouble Chris that's those
64.52 - are my nightmare scenarios let's go next
67.32 - slide Beth that's the double tap as we
69.96 - call it right you're short the puts and
71.28 - then all of a sudden the market sells
72.36 - off with a V
74.68 - expansion so the outlier moves in Nvidia
77.72 - caused Monday just this most recent
79.72 - Monday caused the V Spike to 72 from 48
84.20 - um of the previous trading day with an
85.88 - expected move range is shown below um
88.88 - you know obviously
90.96 - we're using Nvidia here
93.40 - because the simplest way to say why do
95.72 - you choose Nvidia um well we could
97.88 - choose it because it's a$ three and.
99.08 - half trillion dollar stock but we can
100.80 - also choose it because it had the most
103.88 - option volume um by a lot I think I
107.80 - think there was one day last week where
109.76 - we did 10 million Nvidia contracts
112.04 - industrywide 10 million you know I first
114.72 - started this business we were doing a
115.84 - million contracts a day it was a lot now
117.92 - we're doing 10 million contracts in in
119.88 - Nidia and I the yesterday I think we did
122.52 - five or 6 million Nvidia or 7 million
124.76 - some crazy numbers that's why we chose
126.36 - it let's go next slide
129.20 - Beth so with an ivy rank of
131.96 - 54 and a March 21st that's that's
136.40 - regular March expiration 30 Delta
138.44 - strangle of
141.04 - $10.45 using only 5,500 mine power now
144.52 - if you have a March 30 Delta strangle of
146.40 - 1050 you know you can understand why a
148.80 - $30 move will mess you up with more than
152.04 - a
152.72 - 60% um win
155.16 - rate that's a that's
157.76 - a derivative of black schs that number
161.16 - so it may seem like a tempting trade to
163.00 - put on however we need to make sure we
166.36 - are considering all risks as well now
169.88 - one thing to note here Chris first of
172.12 - all nothing is mispriced let's be very
174.40 - clear about this nothing is mispriced
176.68 - nothing is ever
178.16 - mispriced and the other thing is when we
181.04 - talk about these kind of Trades the one
183.56 - way to defend yourself to protect
186.32 - yourself is or protect against a $30
189.84 - move in Nvidia is just to stay
193.00 - small that's your way that's what you
196.56 - can control let's go to next
202.80 - slide so at first glance a short
205.36 - strangle in Nvidia seems to have a
207.68 - typical risk reward profile since
209.32 - implied volatility has overstated
211.56 - historical volatility on average we
213.92 - included the spies and the cu's IV and
216.28 - HV for reference as well this also has
218.92 - to do with the conversation we were
220.52 - having before when Julia was on the show
222.68 - this morning but just to give you some
225.04 - kind of
226.16 - comparison um average implied volatility
229.44 - which is forward-looking expected in the
232.44 - qes was 23 the actual historical 20 spy
237.48 - again 3% difference and
240.28 - um between 18 and 15 and Nvidia a little
243.28 - bit less 49 to 47 if you looked at this
246.96 - you'd say okay the risk reward profile
251.80 - is pretty similar across the
254.44 - board similar across the board but also
257.36 - in line with the understanding that IVs
259.32 - typically overstate the historical
260.76 - volatility so nothing really unusual
262.76 - there not nothing at all just wanted to
264.64 - show you that it compares to what it
266.52 - looks like in the ETFs as well let's go
269.44 - to the the next slide Beth however when
272.12 - digging deeper it seems like the number
275.16 - of outlier moves as well as the
278.40 - magnitude of the outlier moves in Nvidia
281.08 - and the Diversified indexes were nearly
284.08 - identical who would have thought that
286.08 - see this is where I get messed up I look
288.76 - at something like Nvidia and I'm like
290.96 - there is no way that the daily moves
294.48 - that exceed two standard deviations
297.12 - which have less than a 5% chance of
298.96 - happening
300.32 - would be the same in Nvidia and spy and
304.24 - q's since
306.20 - 2017 like this is the slide that messes
309.64 - me up the most because I never I've been
312.12 - trading Nvidia and it feels like all the
314.20 - outlier moves are in Nvidia It Feels
316.92 - Like Only outlier moves exist in Nvidia
319.96 - yes Gad sent this over right when Gad
322.36 - sent this over I said wow that's that's
324.96 - shocking but that goes on to the bigger
327.20 - Point here about the idiosyncratic risk
328.68 - and trading some these single stock
331.40 - names um it is it's it's like wild to me
338.24 - that that that the spy and qes have
341.16 - almost the exact same number of
342.44 - occurrences and the average um s
345.04 - deviation move when you exceed two
346.24 - standard deviations wild to me let's go
348.56 - next slide
350.40 - Beth so then why does it seem for most
354.56 - that Nvidia is riskier to trade than the
357.76 - Spy The Q's if the outlier risk the
359.72 - number of two standard deviation moves
361.28 - and the overall risk the IV
363.16 - overstatement for both the index and
365.96 - Nvidia are nearly
367.64 - identical because they're all about the
369.80 - same all that's why we did this study
372.12 - all these numbers are the same so why
375.24 - does it seem like you take so much more
378.12 - risk when you trade Nvidia because the
380.04 - implied volatility is higher I mean I'm
381.84 - just you know throwing it out there
384.60 - let's go next SL throwing it out there
385.72 - to M well I think we're going to find
386.88 - out the
387.76 - answer and the answer lies in the
391.20 - velocity of implied
394.24 - volatility we talk about velocity a lot
397.32 - on this network and the reason we do is
400.04 - because velocity is the the velocity of
403.72 - risk is what we call basically is what
405.92 - option pricing skew is so the velocity
409.28 - of implied volatility this translates
411.20 - into how quickly implied volatility can
414.20 - Spike on any given day we can quantify
419.16 - this by looking at the average and the
420.92 - standard deviations of historical daily
424.16 - implied volatility
426.36 - increases um so really the answer is in
430.96 - how fast implied volatility can move you
433.64 - know Nvidia can go from 40 to 70 but
438.12 - it's tough for the indexes to go from 20
441.72 - to 40 and that's and that's the
444.48 - difference let's go to next slide so
446.72 - when Nvidia implied volatility expands
449.68 - and here's the key it expands by 57%
453.24 - more than the spy and 60% more than the
456.12 - q's in addition Nvidia implied
458.92 - volatility has double the range of
461.36 - expansion potential than the QQQ IV
466.32 - does um
468.80 - so however the minimum Maxi daily
471.92 - increases are almost identical so this
474.48 - is where basically the the additional
477.48 - risk comes into play now you get paid
480.64 - for that additional risk because if you
482.04 - sold the same strangle in the qes the
484.72 - same Delta strangle you'd collect about
486.96 - a third of the amount of capital that's
489.60 - the
490.36 - difference so the average of the
493.44 - historical daily implied volatility
495.60 - increases is about let's call it double
498.56 - in Nvidia over the other ones and
501.60 - everything else kind of
504.16 - stays exactly the same except the
507.44 - standard deviation of historical daily
508.92 - volatility increases is higher that's it
511.28 - about
512.84 - 50% um showing you where the additional
515.56 - risk comes and why you get paid the
517.00 - additional money for trading underly
519.64 - that has higher volatility than the
522.44 - indices does it it's not just Nvidia
525.24 - right it do any stock would fit this
527.28 - profile just for it's not just Nvidia we
529.16 - just use Nvidia as an example they're
530.72 - all the same and this is why if you
533.56 - trade some of these equities you get
535.48 - paid more money you take more risk you
537.68 - get paid more money that's exactly how
539.16 - it works
539.96 - works this whole industry is
542.80 - theoretically on spoton but you take
546.52 - more risk you get paid more money let's
548.52 - go next
550.56 - slide so the reason why trading single
553.36 - stocks tends to be more risky and has
556.72 - more potential reward that's the offset
559.32 - than trading ETFs is due to the large
561.20 - potential velocity of IV
563.80 - expansion as shown in our studies single
567.24 - stocks also have a tendency to have more
569.68 - outliers than ETFs but in nidia's case
572.76 - the main risk is to be aware of its IV
576.24 - expansion risk that is one solid study
