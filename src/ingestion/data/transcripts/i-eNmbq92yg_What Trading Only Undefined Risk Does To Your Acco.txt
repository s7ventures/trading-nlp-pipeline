0.12 - navigating Capital allocation and buying
2.96 - power reduction let's take a look and
5.16 - see where the boys are going with this
7.48 - so the past two Mondays actually you
9.64 - know yeah it's it's it seems like you
12.32 - know August 5th was a Monday and then
14.40 - you know the Deep seek was a Monday and
16.56 - this past Monday was down 100 you know
18.28 - it's crazy the past two Mondays they've
20.60 - seen
22.00 - significant uh rise in the vix after
24.44 - major weekend news this has caused some
27.08 - Traders some overall portfolio buying
30.32 - power buying power reduction to balloon
33.28 - causing them to allocate more Capital
34.92 - than than they initially started with
37.04 - let's take a look and see how that
38.76 - happens because we should point this out
42.20 - if you have Futures positions on the
44.48 - volatility can adjust based on time and
46.76 - based on I mean the the the capital can
49.52 - adjust based on time and based on
53.16 - volatility and Futures and Futures
54.92 - options but in listed options the
57.84 - requirements are static so if the
60.32 - requirements are static then why would
62.96 - it require more money and the answer is
65.32 - just because of the draw down in p&l you
68.68 - know it just it just sucks up the
70.08 - available cash this is due to BPR
72.80 - expansion Define risk strategies usually
75.12 - don't change buying power reduction
77.00 - during the trade as the max loss is
78.80 - already defined at order entry however
81.20 - undefined risk strategies have the
83.00 - possibility for buying power reduction
85.12 - to greatly change throughout the trade
88.00 - this is why different account sizes are
89.52 - only able able to trade undefined risk
91.80 - with certain stocks as we show in the
93.52 - next slide let's go to let's
95.88 - go so here's something that we kind of
100.08 - put out here just to help people a
101.48 - little bit which is underlying asset
103.96 - selection for diverse account sizes so
106.88 - 10,000 100,000 a million dollars just
109.36 - showing like you know what you could
112.04 - potentially um different stocks that you
114.08 - could look at based on account size that
116.20 - might fit into those um to those those
120.40 - percentage breakdowns that I gave before
122.96 - you know like between you know 1 and 3%
125.96 - a half a percent and 2% defined risk
128.76 - between three and five or 3 and 7%
131.64 - undefined risk you know obviously one of
134.56 - the advantages larger accounts have is
136.72 - you can do more stuff I I want to be
139.40 - really clear about this the reason
142.12 - though Rich it's very rare because of
145.96 - one big down move for us to change the
148.96 - requirements on an individual stock like
152.76 - requirements we have for um for SLV or
157.04 - the requirements we have you know for
159.40 - apple or the requirements we have for
161.00 - spy those requirements don't change
164.68 - those are really static it would take a
167.40 - lot for us to change it would be a big
169.56 - move in the market for us to change spy
172.00 - requirements or Q requirements or you
174.52 - know or Target requirements but what
177.00 - does happen is that because of a big
180.92 - move you could have a mark to Market or
183.52 - a paper loss that could drain some of
186.00 - the excess Capital which then puts you
188.88 - which could put you into a situation
190.76 - where you've got to free up some cash to
192.16 - hold positions let's go next
195.28 - slide now Tom you let Julia read a slide
198.48 - yesterday so do do I get the same uh you
200.92 - could you could take it from here
202.08 - pleasure you could take it from here so
204.96 - buying power reduction formula here's
207.48 - the all important uh formula for naked
210.28 - option strategies so the ones with
212.64 - undefined risk the underlying price
215.48 - plays the most important role in
217.76 - calculating the BPR followed by out the
220.92 - money value Then followed by the option
224.04 - premium and it's what I didn't realize
226.52 - at the time was it's 20% of the
228.48 - underlying price times 100 uh minus the
232.64 - outof the money value and plus the
236.40 - option premium with the out of money
238.36 - value based on the strikes distance from
241.60 - the stock price and we've got some great
243.84 - examples on the the next
247.40 - screen keep
249.20 - going so here we go if if you are
251.88 - selling the 16 Delta out of the money
255.20 - obviously um spider uh 45 days to expiry
259.92 - and those are naked short puts 20% of
263.56 - the spider price that's going to give
266.12 - you a BPR of
268.72 - 12,020 then you take off the outof the
272.04 - money value because it's 16 Delta we're
273.96 - so far away so you get a benefit of
277.84 - 3,764 but then you add back on the
280.32 - option premium 335 that gives you a
283.16 - total of
286.44 - 8591 and as you can see as the Delta
289.88 - increases so you're when you're at the
292.16 - money you don't get any of the out of
295.44 - the money benefit so then your your BPR
298.64 - reduction goes up to
301.84 - 13,110 uh slightly higher again if you
304.48 - are trading the the 75 in the money
309.04 - Delta so the distance between an out of
312.00 - the money and at the money strike price
313.88 - plays a huge role in why the BPR for an
316.96 - outof the money strategy is much
319.84 - less let's look at the strangle if it's
322.60 - a 16 Delta strangle how do we work out
324.64 - the BPR well you take the it's equal to
328.72 - the highest BP from the naked put or
331.92 - call side so whichever one's the highest
335.12 - that's what your BPR is going to
337.52 - be yeah that's good um keep going keep
342.52 - going so some Traders are curious why
345.44 - the BPR for their naked positions such
347.52 - as short puts short calls and strangles
350.40 - can suddenly change often increasing as
353.32 - it did to me a week past monday even
356.76 - when the underlying price stays the same
359.80 - aside from stock price movements the
361.72 - next big reason for BPR fluctuations is
364.52 - an increase in implied volatility a
367.76 - quick spike in IV can boost the option
370.84 - premium which in turn raises that
375.92 - BPR exactly keep
380.28 - going so now here's here's the stock
383.60 - that actually caught me because my
384.84 - biggest BPR and capital requirement out
387.80 - of my whole portfolio is of course in
389.72 - Nidia uh this Nvidia example
391.88 - demonstrates how stock movement and
393.48 - changes in the IV affect daily BPR
397.56 - fluctuations let's look at the one
399.52 - standard deviation strangle for February
403.32 - in
404.28 - Nvidia and you can see what happened
406.84 - here over those two Monday periods and
409.64 - this is great work from the guys because
411.20 - it's actually real
412.56 - numbers you saw that shock the stock
415.28 - price move from 143 down to 118 on the
419.04 - Deep SE news and the IV jumped from 48
423.48 - to
424.72 - 72 this saw a surge in that
428.52 - BPR from
432.12 - 1,977 an increase of
435.04 - 119% to
436.96 - 4476 and this is what caught me off
440.20 - guard uh then you can see it drops back
443.08 - down after the market rallied so nicely
445.56 - on the
446.96 - Tuesday but then with a secondary shock
449.60 - on um Mr uh Mr Trump's tariffs then we
454.80 - saw uh an increase once more to actually
458.76 - higher V the implied VA went up to
462.28 - 74 and uh a BPR of
465.48 - 4,597 I'm I'm really surprised by those
467.92 - numbers those seem so much larger than I
469.96 - thought they would be yeah that's that's
472.60 - what really caught me out yeah that
474.12 - seems crazy to me that I didn't realize
476.28 - they were that big let's go next slide
478.00 - Beth
481.16 - therefore it is crucial to allocate
483.84 - Capital wisely into options positions
487.12 - typically we should keep our total
489.16 - committed trading Capital around
491.48 - 25% when IV is low because of course you
495.00 - want that room for a big um a big surge
498.72 - in in implied volatility remember
500.68 - January
501.92 - 2018 that was V mageddon and we when we
506.32 - saw V increase by um by more than 80%
510.24 - uh so so yeah keeping it around 25% then
513.92 - is uh the most efficient safest idea
517.68 - then when IV is elevated Traders have
519.72 - the opportunity to take larger positions
521.76 - to capture higher premium however any
525.20 - Capital allocation exceeding 50% and
528.28 - this is where I get a smack on the wrist
531.32 - uh 50% should be carefully monitored as
534.28 - this number can quickly expand if the
537.48 - market moves against the portfolio yeah
539.96 - I just want to say one thing here
541.24 - because we're running late these numbers
543.40 - are the most conservative case we have a
545.84 - moderate case which is about 33% higher
549.08 - we have a uh aggressive case which is 50
553.28 - to 60% higher so so just these are this
557.56 - is the most conservative case because I
559.12 - don't want to confuse people and very
560.76 - few of us use the most conservative case
562.84 - most of us are in the moderate to more
564.28 - aggressive case let's go to the next
566.12 - slide Beth and we got to wrap it up yeah
568.44 - I'm right 785 % just now Tom do you want
570.76 - to take the takeaways buying power
572.68 - reduction can fluctuate significantly in
574.92 - undefined risk strategies due to stock
576.60 - price and implied volatility changes
578.72 - unlike theine risk strategies where the
580.32 - BPR is stable this can lead to over
584.00 - Capital allocation in your portfolio
585.68 - with adverse Market moves the key always
589.44 - stay small stay small and I like the
592.76 - moderate to aggressive case but you stay
594.52 - small BPR is mainly determined by
597.24 - underlying price out of the money strike
598.88 - distance and option premium with a
601.12 - strangle BPR based on higher the higher
605.40 - BPR of the naked call or the put
607.48 - whichever one's higher and allocate
610.60 - Capital wisely maintaining around 25% in
613.76 - low IV and monitoring positions over 50%
617.16 - in high I most conservative case to
619.96 - manage potential and Rapid um buying
623.16 - power
624.72 - expansion um and listen again keep size
628.16 - small you'll be fine
