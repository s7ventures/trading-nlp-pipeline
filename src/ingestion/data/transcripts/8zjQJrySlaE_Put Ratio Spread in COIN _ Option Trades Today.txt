0.08 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.32 - the Baptista I have a trade idea for you
3.96 - today January 26th
7.00 - 2024 the year is over almost over I hope
10.48 - you all had a Merry Christmas a happy
12.24 - Hanukkah or whatever that you uh
14.76 - celebrate over this long break but you
17.04 - know what the Market's not taking a
18.36 - break and let's see what's going on
21.04 - &ps down $4 basically um an unchanged
25.72 - day NASDAQ down
28.08 - 12 excuse me I'm fighting off a cold uh
31.12 - Russell up 13 and the Dow up 14 Dow and
35.44 - the Russell A Little Bit Stronger today
37.12 - Russell being the strongest of the group
39.76 - and &ps and NASDAQ being the weakest of
42.36 - the group volatility up 30 cents after
45.00 - getting creamed the last 3 or 4 days as
47.76 - you can see here volatility going from
49.64 - the low 20s down into the mid teens
54.24 - 1622 and bonds continue to fall down
57.24 - nine ticks I looked into bonds a little
60.40 - bit I'm the world's worst commodity
62.04 - Trader so I decided to go with a a
64.60 - pseudo commodity trade I went with coin
68.72 - now when you look at the numbers on coin
70.48 - here just from the the chart itself coin
73.24 - down
74.20 - $434 Ivy rank of 11 and change usually
78.52 - not a premium selling strategy for us
81.80 - but I'm going to do it with a little bit
82.88 - of Premium selling with a directional
85.04 - bias to it now I was looking into coin
88.44 - as maybe doing a diagonal trade in here
91.36 - something like selling the Feb uh
94.32 - options that are two or three strikes
96.24 - I'm sorry buying the Feb options that
98.44 - are one two or three strikes out of the
100.68 - money and selling the January options
103.64 - that are two three four strikes out of
105.68 - the money to give myself a little bit of
107.52 - long Delta in here but with earnings
110.84 - looming on January 29th and only 22 days
115.72 - to January options I figured I needed a
119.08 - a quicker move to the upside then I
121.56 - would think I wanted to stay in this
123.96 - strategy meaning that I didn't know if I
125.88 - had the timing right on this trade I am
128.24 - going to go with a somewhat seemingly
130.48 - Delta long uh strategy in here but well
134.00 - outside the expected move let me explain
136.16 - a quick second you'll notice here that
138.04 - the ivy rank being 11 and change looks
140.76 - like there's a little bit of skewed data
142.92 - in here because there's no reason for
144.68 - coin to go from an ivy rank of 40
146.72 - something a little bit more uh High High
151.28 - to
152.60 - mid-range uh for its Ivy Rank and to
155.68 - come down to 11 I think yesterday with
157.76 - the day off is screwing or the market
160.00 - being closed is skewing a lot of these
162.88 - Ivy ranks to look artificially low so
165.88 - I'm going to take that off with a grain
167.68 - of salt I'm going to go here um on the
170.56 - tasty trade platform and look at the
172.48 - watch list here you'll see that coin is
174.72 - down
176.28 - $4.75 it's had a decent size range at
179.04 - the lower end of its range but it's been
180.76 - lower than this looks a little weak
182.72 - today and that's why I'm going to look
185.16 - for a little bit of a bullish type trade
187.44 - in coin we also had Bitcoin up around
190.20 - 100,000 100,000 And1 uh just last night
194.88 - you can see here Bitcoin uh
196.92 - significantly higher last I'm going to
198.60 - play for a little of end of the rally in
201.36 - Bitcoin so that coin
204.32 - too uh might benefit from that now I'm
207.32 - looking at when you when you're doing
209.16 - this type of trade I'm going to do a 1x
210.92 - two put ratio spread here I'm going to
213.36 - be able to go $10 wide which is nice too
216.20 - um you're always taking a look at you
217.88 - know the volatility because you're
219.04 - selling an extra unit here the implied
221.64 - volatility of 83 83 seems to be quite
224.96 - high when I compare it to some of the
226.60 - other uh months that we have here but
228.64 - don't forget you do have earnings coming
231.28 - January 29th that will um have a little
235.24 - bit of bearing on these options since
236.92 - they're February 21st but with a almost
239.80 - a month away I don't think you're going
241.80 - to see February volatility uptick that
244.56 - much to uh to to kind of scare you away
248.76 - from this trade so what am I looking to
250.68 - do here I said it was a 1 by two ratio
254.00 - spread I usually like to go with my with
256.92 - my buy somewhere around the 15ish Delta
259.96 - I'm going to go even further out of the
261.92 - money by going to the 180 puts I'm going
265.00 - to buy the 180 puts we're looking at
267.04 - around uh right at the standard
269.20 - deviation here that's that dotted line
271.84 - I'm buying the 180s and I'm going to
274.08 - look to sell two of the 170s two of the
278.88 - 170s I was actually able to do this
281.20 - markets are quite wide here with with
283.80 - Bitcoin a little bit higher uh than it
286.72 - is right now remember the lower it goes
288.40 - the better off you are I was able to do
290.52 - this for
292.20 - $176 credit here you can see the mid
294.48 - price is now A180
297.12 - $1.75 so with the stock right around
299.76 - here I was able to do this for a
302.56 - $1.76 credit markets are a little wide
305.36 - here you'll notice that these options
306.72 - are 15 and these options are even wider
310.76 - than that so A good reference would be
313.40 - where I got filled remember this is a
315.68 - small Delta trade for Deltas you'll
318.44 - probably be able to get filled at a
320.12 - similar price if you go in when the
322.44 - stock is down around $5 $5 and change
326.16 - but please go in a little bit higher
329.28 - work walk your order down it doesn't
331.88 - cost you anything this trade is a 94%
334.68 - pop it does have a positive Theta decay
338.24 - of 7 and A2 it does have four long
341.28 - Deltas you'll notice when I've done
342.64 - these trades um previously I'd have 10
346.12 - 12 15 almost 20 Deltas I'm going much
349.56 - further out of the money here a matter
351.36 - of fact my break even on this trade is
355.48 - $160 if you look at the chart here we
358.04 - haven't seen $160 well we got down or
361.64 - close to it back in September and if you
364.56 - throw out September we haven't been back
366.80 - there since about a year ago in February
370.68 - now does this make it a does this make
372.60 - it an
373.44 - unreasonable
375.00 - uh idea that that coin would never go
377.92 - back down to$ 160 about $90 lower than
380.88 - where it is right now even though the
382.84 - expected move is only
384.96 - $62 no anything can happen but for the
388.04 - $3,400 in buying power to collect
391.76 - $176 looking to make a buck on a
394.28 - directional bias I want the stock to go
396.24 - a little bit higher or volatility to
398.68 - contract and this extra unit um Decay a
402.08 - lot faster than my long unit with the
405.28 - chance to make $1,000 because you'll
407.68 - notice here my Max profit is $1,000 plus
411.04 - the credit I received so
413.88 - $1,176 it looks like the type of trade
416.24 - that I don't mind
417.60 - holding well into February expiration
421.40 - and into earnings which are January 29th
427.08 - in coin 94% pop positive Theta Decay I'm
431.92 - going to throw out this Ivy rank of
433.72 - being very low because I think the
435.00 - numbers are a little screwed up because
436.52 - of uh the day off this week uh and
439.56 - that's why I also moved it further away
441.96 - to give myself less Delta less
444.04 - directional risk tying up
446.28 - $3,400 my Max profit which I think is a
448.68 - little unreasonable cuz that probably
449.92 - will not hold us uh into expiration and
452.80 - we probably are not going to get a pin
454.44 - of 170 but maybe we can get a little bit
456.96 - of a lower down move and you'll be able
458.36 - to make some money on this trade even
459.88 - more than the $1.76 that you put here
462.40 - see as you see the stock going lower you
464.84 - can see the mid price moves around I
466.44 - don't think you'll be able to get filled
467.76 - at a $1.93 but maybe you get filled a
470.04 - little bit better if I get off this
471.80 - video and the stock is still down here
473.20 - I'll put on a couple more contracts and
475.12 - try to put on the follow page uh for you
478.84 - where you'll see this trade uh again
481.16 - I'll get off of the this podcast I'll
