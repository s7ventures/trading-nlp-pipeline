0.16 - how many times a day would you estimate
2.52 - that you adjust your positions and your
4.56 - overall portfolio Deltas do you do this
7.00 - throughout the day or is it just on the
8.56 - open and the close I anticipate never
10.48 - doing it happens sometimes maybe even
12.80 - more than than you would think when I'm
14.80 - making an adjustment it's typically 1.5
17.92 - I would say you know usually I make one
19.52 - adjustment during the day it's it's
21.00 - enough and then you get those days uh
23.20 - maybe like even today where you roll
25.44 - down you try to play a little bit of
27.00 - Market awareness here you think maybe
28.48 - the Market's going to Rally back a
29.64 - little bit and if it doesn't you roll
31.08 - down again and again I would say at a
33.16 - very minimum once a day we go through
35.04 - all our positions and we make
36.68 - adjustments if we need to I would say if
38.64 - the markets are active we could do that
40.28 - three or four times a day so on average
42.40 - I'm going to say two but it doesn't
45.08 - necessarily have to be on the open it
46.32 - doesn't necessarily have to be on the
47.36 - close a lot of times I'll do it midday
49.64 - on a day like today I might adjust my
51.48 - positions two or three times on a normal
53.48 - day less obviously
