0.16 - all right so we're going to talk about
1.60 - premium Decay today so theoretically in
4.60 - at the money options premium Decay looks
6.60 - like this accelerating in the last 50
8.64 - days but basically when you're looking
10.48 - at premium Decay it's not a linear curve
13.36 - when you look further out in time it's a
15.32 - a lot slower Decay as you get to that 40
17.96 - to 50-day time frame premium Decay
20.36 - starts to accelerate as you get closer
22.52 - to expiration of course there's a point
24.80 - of uh of risk reward baked into this of
28.28 - course you have faster decay as you get
30.48 - closer to expiration but that comes with
33.20 - a lot more risk uh versus something
35.36 - that's 40 or 50 days out in time does
37.60 - this hold true in real trading uh to
39.92 - test this we need to separate the
41.72 - occurrences with and without directional
43.92 - movement if the current stock price is
45.84 - close enough to the original stock price
47.80 - then we can say the positions p&l is
50.28 - purely from Premium Time Decay so we're
53.28 - we're isolating the stock movement and
55.76 - the Delta exposure that you get from
58.40 - short premium and we're just looking at
60.68 - the the data Decay relative to sideways
63.56 - moves in the market so getting to the
65.40 - next slide we're looking at spy we're
67.24 - doing the we're doing 2005 to present we
69.64 - sold the at the money puts um at a 50
72.48 - Delta we recorded uh only the
75.40 - non-movement occurrences so we're
77.40 - looking at the time where the stock uh
80.48 - in this case spy was within 05% of the
84.32 - of the of the price on the previous day
86.84 - so it's basically looking at quote
89.24 - unquote n movements or Inside Moves In
91.44 - the market so first we're going to take
93.24 - a look at the distribution of
94.96 - non-movement occurrences in the 45-day
97.96 - taxation cycles and when we jump to the
101.32 - next one here as expected uh the longer
104.72 - duration the the lower the probability
106.76 - of the stock price coming back to well
109.84 - they're just talking about like expected
111.12 - move so if something moves $30 and it
113.64 - has a $3 expected move over a six-month
117.04 - period of time it's going to take it a
118.52 - lot longer to get back that price even
122.32 - if it goes All in One Direction but now
123.96 - remember from a volatility standpoint
126.32 - you're talking more about being a lot
128.68 - more mean reverting now we're not
129.84 - talking about volatility here just
131.12 - talking about stock stock price itself
133.08 - yeah a lot of times people get to smoke
134.56 - Opium and since we had this large move
136.64 - to the downside or to the upside so
139.12 - quickly that once it backs off it
141.24 - certainly can go back there again and
142.80 - again it is a 5050 shot on Direction but
145.44 - it's all about the implied volatility
147.20 - for an expected move which is 100%
149.92 - correct 68% of the
152.64 - time that's good yeah you had to add
155.36 - that one in that was
157.04 - good jump into the next slide so next we
160.48 - isolate these non-movement occurrences
162.24 - to test how closely the actual daily
164.28 - premium Decay matches the theoretical
166.72 - premium Decay um so this will get you
170.16 - know closer to that original Slide the
172.56 - first slide um that was a non-scientific
175.60 - slide we're going to look at at the
177.76 - actual curve of the realized premium
180.20 - Decay uh we'll jump to slide seven here
183.04 - so the curve of realized premium Decay
185.08 - looks very close to the theoretical one
187.04 - with the acceleration in Decay
189.28 - approaching expiration so as you get
191.56 - closer to expiration of course you're
193.44 - going to have faster premium Decay you
195.72 - only have certain amount of time
197.36 - especially when you're looking at these
198.52 - closer at the money options this goes to
201.12 - the other slide of mean rsion of price
204.32 - being much closer on a day-to-day basis
206.44 - or on a on a shorter duration because
209.04 - it's more of a 5050 shot versus versus a
211.56 - longer duration where you don't have
213.52 - that same sort of coin flip we've known
215.76 - that obviously in the bull markets in
217.80 - the past years tested the call side more
219.96 - often than the put side if we control
221.48 - for the directional bias does the call
223.92 - Premium Decay look similar to the put
227.24 - premium Decay and so again we're looking
229.44 - at these sideways moves versus you know
232.20 - a long period of time where we're only
234.36 - you know we're looking at the the total
236.12 - directional move the this whole study is
238.76 - looking at just those like inside move
241.56 - periods of time and days so the actual
244.04 - premium Decay for calls matches the put
246.24 - premium decay in the hypothetical curve
248.48 - so again you know when you take the
250.96 - directional move out of the equation the
254.12 - Decay on calls and puts are relatively
256.44 - the same as the the takeaway yes here
259.48 - yes agreed agreed takeaways here Delta
262.12 - is one of the largest risks when trading
264.24 - and can adversely impact traded
266.40 - performance and this again goes to um
269.72 - what we were just talking about here we
271.04 - took Delta out of the equation for this
273.24 - study and just looked at premium Decay
275.76 - and tried to kind of compare calls
277.88 - versus puts Delta of course has been the
280.68 - biggest directional or has been the
282.80 - biggest issue for positions over this
285.28 - period of time when we control for Delta
287.72 - the changes in the under underlying
289.44 - price we clearly see where our Returns
292.20 - come from they come from premium Decay
294.48 - that's why we're always talking about
295.76 - looking at high volatility and and mean
297.76 - reversion of volatility theoretical
300.36 - premium Decay very closely matches
302.32 - actual premium Decay since most Traders
305.00 - sell out of money options does actual
307.08 - out of the money option Decay also
309.08 - follow the theoretical that will be
311.48 - covered in part
313.28 - two oo O Part Two looming went that went
318.32 - through that pretty quickly really it
319.32 - was just about price movement right I
321.60 - mean you're looking at probability of
323.68 - pop on expected move that's really what
325.40 - we're
