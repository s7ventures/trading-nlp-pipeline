0.08 - options trading has created an
2.72 - opportunity for me to determine my
4.76 - future I think it's an Avenue for me to
7.20 - eventually sail into the sunset as an
9.40 - options
11.57 - [Music]
14.72 - trade hello everybody we're back I'm Tom
18.04 - snoff and we're here for another Rising
21.16 - Star episode of shoot tenis welcome
25.12 - thank you thank you nice to be here and
26.88 - great to have you here I think I think
29.04 - you and I have crossed has uh many times
31.80 - over the absolutely last handful of
34.36 - years at different live tasty events and
37.64 - um it's great to see her because I never
39.80 - know how anybody does you know like um I
42.80 - think you said to me once uh you're
45.44 - surprised how many people come to the
47.20 - live events but it's good to see because
48.68 - then you realize you're not alone yes
50.52 - yes exactly yeah I was curious because
52.36 - when I came to that event I thought it
53.80 - wasn't just going to be a sizable number
55.76 - of people but the whole place was full I
57.28 - had to go upstairs to the uh mees oh we
61.56 - we we've we've we we first started long
64.76 - time ago 25 years ago we would have
66.60 - events in our conference room yeah which
68.68 - was like about a third of the size of
70.56 - this room where we're doing right now
72.20 - and we' put people around the conference
73.56 - table and like six or eight people would
75.36 - show up um so yeah they would come a
78.04 - long way in that sense the first live
80.32 - show I ever did was at a university here
83.48 - in Chicago a small college and um he did
86.36 - in one of the classrooms and there was
87.56 - about 12 people and I think we all
90.08 - thought we were nuts how long ago was
91.72 - that 25 years 24 years yeah um so uh
96.84 - just to um give everybody a little
99.40 - background so so this Rising Star
102.52 - segment is is really designed to give
104.92 - you some insight into um retail
108.84 - investors do-it-yourself investors that
111.04 - have along the way discovered
113.96 - self-directed finance that have
116.36 - discovered um derivatives strategic
119.12 - investing
120.44 - and people that do it you know in in
124.44 - conjunction with or to complement
126.96 - everything else that you do exactly so
129.68 - uh on your bio it says that you own your
132.32 - own you own your own business you're a
134.80 - mortgage
135.72 - broker and uh you work with your wife
138.56 - and I don't know how many other people
140.56 - and um you and I we were talking about
142.80 - mortgage rates before and things like
144.36 - that but how much time do you have to to
147.52 - actually trade I do right in the morning
150.40 - cuz I have to create time I got to
152.56 - create time I think this options trading
155.56 - has created an opportunity for me to
158.72 - determine my future and I have to put as
162.32 - much time as I put in my mortgage
164.08 - brokerage business into this because I
166.32 - think it's an Avenue for me to
168.00 - eventually sail into the sunset as an
170.20 - options trade I love it I I saw there
173.56 - was a line I read in in your bio that
175.92 - you wrote up for us you said you watched
178.16 - almost every Market measure for the past
180.12 - decade yes yes and I still do and you
183.00 - still do so to give a little background
185.76 - um I think you said you and and I want
190.12 - to make sure I get this right but I
191.64 - think you said you started trading
193.84 - stocks or traded your first kind of
196.20 - stock trade about 2015 yes about N9
199.16 - years ago yes yes N9 years ago yeah yeah
202.32 - and you told me when you went to
205.40 - University you were um uh you were a
209.00 - finance major
210.44 - but you also um didn't really believe in
213.28 - stocks I did not believe in stocks yeah
215.76 - cuz this was around the time when the
217.76 - stock market had just crashed 2008
219.68 - September yeah and the professor wanted
222.20 - to find out what we thought about it and
225.20 - I took a stance that everybody in the
226.88 - class just looked at me wonder what's
228.24 - wrong with this guy what is he doing in
229.48 - this class cuz I stood up and said don't
231.88 - believe in stocks I'll never own some
233.48 - I'll never own any and it's a scam it's
236.96 - a scam yeah my dad used to think that
239.88 - way but other than that I think uh you
242.08 - know
243.56 - um but then you start thinking about it
245.92 - you're like okay well because in 2008
248.48 - they scared the children you know I mean
250.24 - it was kind of a really it was a pretty
252.96 - long bull bare Market about you know
254.68 - almost 500 days and it was it was ugly
258.24 - the economic meltdown was was nasty yes
261.20 - and I guess if you were in school at
262.48 - that time and you're looking at it
263.60 - you're trying to kind of think about it
265.40 - in a macro sense it probably was pretty
267.20 - scary yes yes so do you remember your
269.76 - first stock trade I remember my first
272.04 - stock trade it wasn't the smartest
273.40 - because I paid $9.99 to buy I think two
277.68 - shares so my cost bases went up oh you
280.16 - paid $9.95 in commissions commission to
283.08 - buy two shares to buy two shares of
284.52 - stock to buy two shares of stock yeah
285.72 - two shares of what I was some really
288.20 - cheap stock so my my cost Bas is really
290.40 - scar so you couldn't have broken even if
292.12 - you wanted to I could not have broken
294.68 - yeah I forgot about the 9.95 commissions
297.20 - yeah um for two shares two shares yeah
300.72 - okay well in that case it kind of is a
302.84 - scam is a scam yeah CU not much you can
305.36 - do there yeah um but you know so so
310.12 - taking me through the process so for as
312.48 - first start off with two shares yes so
314.96 - so I started off with two shares and
316.32 - then a friend of mine told me you can't
317.56 - do this you got to spread your you know
320.12 - spread your $9.95 over several shares
322.80 - you could bring your cost bases down
324.56 - okay and then
326.72 - I met a friend
329.76 - actually a friend of mine was showing
331.12 - his trades on Facebook okay and they
333.76 - were weird like they didn't look like
335.28 - stock trades and then at that point he
338.80 - told me that he was actually trading
340.28 - options got it so I probably said what
343.88 - what the hell is an option exactly yeah
346.04 - yeah so I started learning about the
347.48 - strike price the expired date all these
350.28 - different metrics that come with trading
352.80 - derivatives and
354.64 - then I segwayed into trading options but
358.96 - I was taking the laws side sure buying
361.52 - calls buying puts and losing a lot of
363.96 - money okay all right that's fair yeah um
366.84 - but you were learning I was learning
368.88 - know I was taking L's for lessons in and
371.60 - a big part of what I always talk about
373.84 - with trading and especially you know any
376.20 - kind of strategic investing is you know
378.84 - you have to you know there's there's a
382.40 - saying in Chicago because this is kind
384.28 - of a blues City yeah you got to suffer
386.56 - if you want to sing the blues and I
388.52 - think that that's the case here you got
389.80 - to suffer if you want to see the blues a
391.00 - little bit so um so I'm going to fast
394.20 - forward uh to you you you started
397.12 - trading options it I learned around 2017
401.72 - yes yes okay and like you said you
404.08 - started buying calls and buying puts but
407.24 - you're learning about making decisions
409.00 - you're learning about leverage you're
410.88 - learning about derivatives but you're
413.04 - not making any money not making any
414.56 - money so why'd you stay with it actually
417.16 - I took a pause so I took a pause so I
419.04 - could focus on my business at the time
421.40 - as a mortgage specialist uhhuh before I
423.36 - went into becoming a mortgage broker so
425.32 - I took a break from options and then I
428.08 - met a friend who told me hey there these
430.64 - two guys who banter and go at each other
434.16 - and they talk about options and they
435.56 - doing it differently so I watched one of
438.24 - your shows oh God you know and then
442.04 - that's when I realized wait you could
443.16 - actually take the other side of the yeah
444.96 - trade and that's when the tasty trade
446.96 - way started in September 2022 got it
450.24 - yeah got it so there's a there's a
451.92 - little bit of a fiveyear period in there
454.40 - where you know you're figuring things
456.24 - out and and listen actually in during
458.76 - that 5year period I was holding uh
461.28 - mostly Canadian Bank stocks so I was
463.24 - selling covered calls against them so
465.28 - they selling covered calls buying Bank
466.80 - stock selling covered calls which was
468.12 - probably a good trade yeah it worked out
470.76 - you're learning about Market structure
473.20 - you know you're learning about taking
474.44 - risk um you're reducing your basis yes
478.24 - okay so all all the above and then in
481.40 - 2022 you start watching tasty started
484.04 - watching tasty and then I got into this
485.92 - rabbit hole and all those Mo it's like
488.44 - Tik Tok exactly all those marcket
491.04 - measures that you and Tom you and Tony
493.72 - did from way back I just started
496.56 - absorbing all of them okay yeah and then
500.64 - I became intent on learning this and
505.20 - making something good out of it so when
507.84 - you started trading like
510.20 - tasty style 2022 let's say and um do you
515.40 - mind saying how old you are I am 36 36
519.00 - yes okay so in 2022 you were 34 34 yeah
523.44 - okay how how big was your account size
526.12 - it was uh about 60 Grand cuz cuz people
530.04 - always write into us after we do Rising
531.80 - Stars say well you know was he trading
534.16 - with $2,000 or $5,000 or 200,000 or
537.00 - whatever it so it gives some context
538.84 - yeah yeah okay ex did your wife think
540.92 - you were crazy she thought I was crazy
543.00 - but then she did believe in me she I
545.12 - mean I had I had a track record of going
547.44 - into crazy things and pulling out okay
550.04 - like
550.96 - what uh going into the mortgage business
554.44 - okay was uh it's a 100% commission so
557.12 - going from a salary to 100% commission
559.44 - yeah that was a crazy jump okay that
561.36 - that is kind of crazy that was crazy
562.92 - yeah yeah and I you're just betting on
564.16 - yourself it's okay betting on myself
565.64 - exactly that's okay yeah yeah so she
567.56 - thought I was crazy but she believed it
568.80 - me and she just be okay so how'd you do
571.88 - in 2022 so 2022 was a short stint I only
576.04 - had I think a couple months and I was
578.00 - still learning so I wasn't doing too
579.76 - well I think it's not until May 2023
583.36 - that things kind of clicked that's when
585.20 - I realize okay you just have to do as
587.16 - many trades as you can let the low of
589.88 - averages or the numbers work for you and
592.92 - eventually something's going to come out
594.24 - of it so I went down and then it picked
596.80 - up and then once it picked up it feel
599.48 - was no stopping after that so 2023 was
602.80 - really was really your breakout Year yes
605.72 - yeah and you did it your return
607.88 - investment was 100% yes so you doubled
610.08 - your money yes so then you got to think
612.64 - like so now you're cocky cuz now you're
615.04 - thinking like this I got this i got this
618.12 - thing down you're like I'm unstoppable
620.72 - right if I double my money every year I
622.52 - go 60 120 240 you know 580 and then I'm
627.16 - up to a million doll in four years I got
629.96 - this right yeah piece of
632.00 - cake I have to warn you that that's not
634.44 - exactly the way this works but um but
637.44 - and it didn't work that way there's
638.80 - always a a root Awakening okay how many
642.08 - trades you think you made in
643.84 - 2023 I used to do at least at least five
647.40 - trades a day five trades a day is you
649.96 - know is pretty close to let's call it on
652.72 - average that averages out to about
654.08 - between 13 and 1,500 trades a year yeah
657.40 - and you know that is that's a
660.04 - significant amount it's it's more than
663.32 - the average tasty Trader it's a little
665.32 - bit know it's a little less than stuff
667.28 - that we do but whatever that's a yeah
669.36 - I'm sure you didn't think before that
671.28 - you're going to be making when you paid
673.40 - $9.95 to trade two shares of stock in
675.52 - 2015 you didn't say wow in seven years
678.20 - from now I'm going to be trading you
679.44 - know 1500 times no no did not I think
682.92 - one of the most valuable takeaways from
685.32 - and one of the most empowering things
686.88 - about making 1500 trades is that you all
689.44 - of a sudden you know you feel
693.28 - like you don't feel like the markets own
695.80 - you anymore like you feel like you're
698.44 - responsible for your own outcome yes
700.44 - right it's not like you don't blame you
702.80 - know not blaming anybody else or there's
705.72 - no manipulation I'm rigged this is just
708.12 - you know either you know sometimes
709.88 - stocks win hopefully I win but but at
713.28 - least at that point you start to
714.64 - recognize this is what Market structure
716.36 - is all about this is what you know this
718.20 - is self determination yeah you know I'm
720.44 - a big freak about controlling what you
723.32 - can control which is obviously order
725.08 - entry yeah yeah yeah how much time do
726.84 - you spend with like managing the
728.60 - positions that you have on if it's a
731.16 - defined risk position I usually don't
734.16 - spend much time managing it uh if it's
737.68 - uh if it's a naked position then I will
740.60 - I'll I'll I'll manage it the time that I
742.84 - spend how much of your positions are
745.52 - defined risk versus naked I would say
747.28 - 50/50 50/50 5050 okay yeah before we get
749.92 - into like specific strategies and stuff
751.84 - like this have you been
754.80 - very mechanical about maning early yes
759.24 - so I manage a 21 days I try not to get
761.96 - tested yeah I'll move my wings I'll move
765.04 - my uh stries away if I notice that I'm
768.12 - getting tested I will roll like I I do
771.32 - roll um I realize that when you roll you
773.80 - actually take a loss but then I in most
776.04 - times when I rolled I yeah recovered
778.52 - what I loss essentially in the initial
780.88 - closing do you prefer any specific like
784.08 - sector or you know indexes ETF sectors
787.88 - or do you basically just rely on
790.36 - volatility I Rely solely on volatility
793.48 - it's good yeah i' like to hear mean
795.32 - reverting yeah so you're indifferent I'm
797.88 - indifferent I could care less what the
799.56 - stock does yeah yeah I like that good
801.96 - good good feel I feel like you're
804.36 - following the mechanics way better than
806.60 - most of our other you know Rising Stars
809.28 - so so it's a market measures I love that
812.80 - so um so after 2023 you know 2024 has
817.92 - been a little whenever you go straight
819.88 - up it's a little more difficult yeah um
821.68 - and 2024 has been kind of a straight up
823.72 - move so this year you're up money but
825.68 - just less yes yes I'm up in 2024 it was
829.04 - a huge lesson when the when that crazy
833.28 - Monday morning happened on August 5th on
835.76 - August 5th was a huge lesson for me I
838.20 - realized that I've been overextending
839.80 - myself mhm uh I didn't have any dry
842.16 - powder on the side to use and I ended up
845.04 - in a couple margin calls okay so I had
847.48 - to write up a trading plan I purposely
849.52 - actually sat down and I wrote a trading
851.40 - plan that has three key metrics so 50%
854.72 - buying power unused that's good any
856.76 - given time yeah 50% cash any given time
861.20 - and then uh the only thing is I don't
863.72 - trade as often as I would want to even
866.52 - though I could see the buying power is
867.80 - there but I I'm trying not to use it
870.88 - yeah but um there's more Capital that
872.88 - I'll be putting in the account that's
874.16 - going to help good I mean listen every
876.32 - once in a while you need an event that
881.04 - scares you straight that did and and
884.00 - that was when you think about that in
886.32 - historical context I know it was like
888.36 - you know one of the top 10 moves of uh
891.64 - whatever the last you know two decades
893.48 - but the reality is it it it wasn't very
897.84 - it was very shortlived yes I mean it was
899.96 - literally one day the next day we
901.36 - exploded so so it wasn't like something
903.88 - that had a lot of fall through and that
906.04 - you know it could have been a lot worse
907.68 - this is I guess my point when we talk
909.96 - about specific strategies is there
912.96 - certain strategies you like more than
914.72 - others yes so I love the broken wing
918.32 - butterfly yeah on you don't care what
920.80 - side I don't care which side yeah I'll
922.56 - do it on the C side I do it on the foot
924.40 - side yeah so that's one of them and then
926.04 - I love strangles MH I love doing short
929.44 - strangles I'll do spreads on both sides
932.16 - on the call side you mean like short
933.72 - vertical yeah short ver spreads yeah did
936.40 - you sell a lot of naked puts yes I love
939.40 - selling naked puts that's how I started
941.56 - actually that was the first market
942.52 - manager that I watched selling naked
944.32 - puts selling naked puts it works it's
946.52 - tried true and like tested yeah yeah
949.40 - yeah and um You probably don't do a lot
952.20 - of covered calls anymore but you know
954.72 - I'm guessing cuz it's just too Capital
956.16 - intensive exactly and I also find that
959.56 - my cover calls don't they don't do too
962.20 - well it it's just it's just not
964.44 - efficient you know I I shouldn't say
966.12 - efficient it's just not it's too Capital
968.04 - inefficient yeah yeah I completely agree
970.24 - as you kind of look into the future
971.92 - right now you're going to be you know
974.56 - you're trapped you're going to be doing
976.48 - this for the rest of your life I know
978.48 - look what you did to me talk I know
979.76 - you're not getting away like you can't
981.16 - get away you just because you're always
983.24 - going to think because there is always
984.40 - going to be opportunity yeah there's
986.36 - always going to be risk there's always
987.24 - going to be opportunity how do you think
988.92 - think about this like with um with all
992.08 - the other risks that you have running
993.64 - your own business because as as an
997.24 - independent you know um mortgage
1000.68 - broker I mean you you have to go get
1003.08 - your own customers you have to you have
1005.16 - to make deals you have to refinance
1006.72 - places you you know you have to the real
1008.48 - estate market has to stay busy there's a
1010.52 - lot of there's you have a lot of risk in
1011.76 - that business yeah yeah yeah exact yeah
1013.88 - and so how do you think about this in
1015.92 - like kind of big picture yeah you know
1018.92 - the interesting thing is I love what I
1020.72 - do so I love both aspects of what I do
1024.16 - being like helping clients find
1026.36 - financing to buy homes and I also love
1028.84 - trading options so it's a it's a nice
1031.52 - balance between the two but eventually
1034.40 - I'm hoping that
1037.04 - when I'm on an island somewhere I could
1039.36 - still trade options and not have to wear
1041.80 - more pick it up phone to deal with to do
1044.68 - real estate deals so this is like my
1046.16 - sale to the sunset type of PL you no you
1049.36 - know I I like the optimism there I don't
1052.32 - think you're ever I I always used to say
1054.56 - the same thing but I'm going to be here
1056.24 - till I die so it do better yeah yeah but
1059.48 - what I was thinking about in your
1061.04 - business is that one of the things that
1063.32 - we that I like to share a lot of is
1065.32 - bonds and I would think
1068.36 - that most people that are in like
1072.04 - banking business and mortgage businesses
1074.24 - and anything to do with like large
1076.56 - Financial Services really don't
1079.44 - don't understand some of the intricacies
1082.88 - and Nuance knowhow of how bond market
1086.96 - really works yeah and I would have to
1089.20 - think that your ability to trade
1092.28 - derivatives on you know on on like Bond
1096.44 - Futures Pond options notes you know any
1099.84 - ETFs like TLT and all that kind of stuff
1101.96 - yeah really gives you a complete a very
1105.16 - different unique perspective that will
1108.44 - allow you to articulate like some of the
1111.20 - um interest rate risk very differently
1112.76 - than some other mortgage broker I would
1114.64 - think that's a huge Advantage you're
1116.00 - very right and I check the bond yield
1118.16 - every morning I monitor it every day I
1120.80 - see what the TLT is doing yeah and
1123.36 - anytime there's an announcement I always
1125.12 - rush to see how the bond market is
1127.08 - reacting does that help in your
1129.16 - conversations with with customers that
1131.64 - you can actually explain it definitely
1133.60 - does and I I'll give you an example so
1135.52 - you have clients who try to get the
1137.16 - lowest rate possible sure and most
1139.68 - financial institutions will give you a
1141.08 - lower rate if the bond yield has dropped
1143.76 - sure so I have to explain to the client
1146.44 - at this point we're not getting lower
1148.28 - rate because look at how the bond market
1149.92 - is doing yeah yeah I was once doing a uh
1155.76 - work we were buying a building for work
1159.60 - and we were negotiating with the um bank
1162.80 - and and I remember I I had traded bonds
1166.04 - all morning and I'm in there talking
1168.72 - talking to this the person who was
1171.52 - handling the mortgage side for
1173.44 - commercial lending and they were trying
1176.24 - to explain to me how interest rates work
1179.04 - and I'm like I'm pretty sure you've
1181.76 - never traded a bond in your entire life
1183.76 - yeah and I think I traded like 200 of
1186.08 - them this morning okay I go don't
1188.92 - explain it to me I know how this works
1191.24 - and they're like okay well most people
1192.92 - don't understand I go I understand this
1194.64 - okay just give me the numbers okay you
1196.88 - don't have to try to explain this to me
1198.08 - because you're explaining it is not how
1199.92 - this works and I I just have to think
1202.08 - that like for you you know it's got to
1204.04 - be it's got to make you seem like you're
1206.52 - just a another level above does yeah and
1210.52 - and being able to explain you know how
1212.44 - how markets are actually efficient in
1214.16 - that regard and they and they basically
1216.44 - move I mean mortgage rates move tick for
1218.56 - tick with they do yeah there's nothing
1220.48 - else to it by the second yeah it's not
1222.28 - rocket science I mean they move
1223.56 - literally tick for tick so um not that I
1227.56 - want you to start hedging
1229.60 - uh interest rates you know and offer
1231.88 - that as part of your plan you know and
1234.08 - uh you know here's a here's a half a
1235.80 - million dollar house we're going to
1237.20 - we're going to hedge your interest rate
1238.40 - risk don't don't do that you you'll
1240.72 - you'll drive people crazy so what's the
1243.32 - game plan going forward in um
1247.68 - 2024 like how do you get better now and
1251.96 - like what about 2025 like like what's
1254.56 - the you I think my my game plan is to
1257.96 - get as many many people as possible into
1260.96 - this because this is their way out and
1264.20 - I've been what's considered a lonely
1265.84 - options Trader for the longest time
1267.40 - because you have your wins you have no
1269.44 - one no one to share it with You' got
1271.20 - your losses you got no one to you're
1273.56 - here I can cry about all my losses today
1275.92 - before I leave you know so my game plan
1278.80 - is to get as many people as possible
1280.80 - into this um hopefully uh eventually get
1284.76 - my kids trading options as well how old
1287.04 - is your oldest my oldest is eight boy or
1289.64 - girl yeah it's a girl nice you have hope
1292.88 - with a girl with boys you have no hope
1294.36 - at eight oh girls you have a chance and
1296.36 - I mean tasty live is always playing on
1297.76 - my TV the whole day they probably think
1299.16 - you're crazy they think I'm crazy yeah
1301.00 - Dad this is the worst Dad this is the
1303.08 - worst show ever can you put something
1305.64 - good on yeah yeah I can imagine I can
1310.04 - imagine so ultimately building you know
1314.76 - building communities is is is obviously
1317.12 - tough of oh the Traders things like that
1319.64 - but I do see more widespread adoption do
1323.92 - you see that slowly by SL slow the ones
1327.28 - the ones who discover it they take it
1330.84 - and they fly with it yeah and then
1333.36 - hopefully they become really big fans
1334.88 - and they'll get people into it yeah I
1337.12 - have a friend of mine who got into it
1340.20 - less than 6 months ago and he's reading
1342.84 - charts and his name is Sam he's crazy
1345.36 - about options he leaves breeds like
1348.24 - everything think it does is just options
1349.84 - traing that's great that's great so the
1353.44 - adoption is there and it's eventually we
1356.68 - hope the finance space takes on this
1360.24 - other side where you just self-determine
1361.84 - your you know active investing is well
1365.12 - like I said before it's really important
1367.36 - in life to um control whatever you you
