0.08 - that means it's not that hard but there
3.20 - are some nuanced there are some nuances
5.80 - of knowhow in this case we're calling
8.36 - this the nuances of
10.36 - volatility a distributional perspective
14.80 - I'm not exactly sure where the team's
16.16 - going with this one me either let's take
19.20 - a look the nuances of volatility a dis
21.92 - that's an interesting
23.40 - word a distributional perspective okay I
26.96 - like it Market volatility the vix is a
30.20 - mean reverting asset whose average over
31.88 - the last years including to
34.24 - 2020 is
37.00 - 18.9 I would have guessed it would have
39.32 - been lower than that if you guess if you
41.60 - ask me over the last eight years which
43.12 - takes us back to
44.56 - 2017 I would have guessed that I would
48.40 - have guessed 18.9 is a little high I
50.36 - would have said closer to 17 but when we
53.24 - say that the vix is mean reverting it's
55.56 - because it's a math
57.56 - equation and
60.72 - it's
62.96 - stocks Futures which are price-based are
68.08 - not mean reverting because price is not
70.24 - mean reverting but when you have some
72.84 - form of an equation like like volatility
75.68 - volatility is meting it gets too high it
77.72 - goes down it gets too low it goes up
81.40 - eventually it's very expensive to hold
84.76 - it knowing that it's mean reverting it's
87.16 - very expensive to hold it until that
88.88 - happens in fact in fact I would say it's
90.76 - next to
91.72 - Impossible um but at some point it will
95.40 - go back let's go next slide looking at
97.68 - an average Al loone can mislead your
99.56 - expectations of how often volatility is
101.32 - at certain levels in other words to get
103.28 - a better picture of how volatility
104.56 - behaves we need to look at its
105.80 - distribution a distribution will show
107.80 - you that not only the average value but
110.88 - also the probabilities around all values
112.92 - that volatility can end up with what's
116.12 - interesting about this is our old
118.64 - research and this may updating our old
120.76 - research our old research used to show
122.96 - that volatility on a distribution basis
125.92 - would go up about 10% of the time go
128.04 - down about 20% of the time and stay in a
130.56 - low State about 70% of the time let's
134.00 - see how this latest piece of research
136.24 - lines up with that so the distribution
138.44 - of all the daily vix value since 2017 is
141.44 - shown below notice the very long right
144.72 - skewed Tail Of course that gives you a
147.04 - good little picture but let's keep going
149.04 - yeah sure because of this large right
152.12 - tail that covers many large values with
155.08 - low probability the average of
157.80 - 18.7 does not split the values of the
160.64 - distribution evenly in fact it is
163.32 - roughly one and a half times as likely
165.04 - for the vix to be below average on any
167.68 - given day 60% of the time then above the
170.68 - average 40% of the time that's why you
173.88 - can see that yellow line kind of all the
176.88 - way to the left on this
178.60 - graph which
180.44 - okay this starts to bring that whole all
182.88 - that you know lull State into you know
185.52 - into perspective a little bit more let's
187.44 - go to the next
189.36 - slide that's a really good picture there
192.40 - the median the 50th percentile the vixs
194.80 - is 16.4 that makes more sense to me the
198.24 - median by definition tells us the value
201.88 - where the distributions occurrences are
204.56 - split
206.08 - equally so it is much lower in other
209.60 - words half the time the vix is above
212.44 - 16.4 and half the time it's below
217.72 - 16.4 all this again this is the
221.56 - distributional uh perspective of
223.88 - volatility it is very nuanced let's go
226.80 - to next
229.56 - Slide the chances of falling into the
233.96 - tale of the distribution this case um
237.12 - defined by the vix value great G than 30
241.00 - is just under
243.24 - 7% rarely do we get a vix over 30 is
246.36 - what that
247.32 - means sure I would have said the number
249.44 - was closer to five or 2% something like
251.80 - that you know two or three distribution
254.40 - curve I think over 35 it's going to be
256.36 - closer to two or 3% but 30% seven 93% of
261.60 - those are below that with the current
263.36 - vix at 16.1 as it close on Friday
266.40 - February 7th we look into the
270.60 - distribution graph from
274.68 - 2024 and you can see it's not that
277.04 - dramatically different from the other
278.36 - things that we were just talking about
279.96 - so some of the takeaways here when
281.76 - looking at an asset like
283.68 - volatility with non normally distributed
287.20 - prices it's important to consider values
290.16 - besides just the average the average
292.76 - tells you the typical value to Expect
295.32 - When taking into account the magnitude
296.88 - of each value whereas the median tells
298.80 - us the typical value Val to Expect When
300.96 - taking into account only the number of
302.40 - occurrences literally the middle value
304.84 - with normally distributed data sets no
307.28 - skew the median and the average are the
309.56 - same in this case a little bit different
311.92 - but um oh no the median average has be
313.68 - the same yes no about yeah right yep but
316.96 - yeah I mean that's how you get down to
318.28 - that 16 level that's actually really
319.84 - good that just shows you that you know
322.28 - there there there's a pretty low chance
325.12 - the vix over 30 you know over time but
329.36 - and 's a high chance of it trading below
331.48 - that 16 level
