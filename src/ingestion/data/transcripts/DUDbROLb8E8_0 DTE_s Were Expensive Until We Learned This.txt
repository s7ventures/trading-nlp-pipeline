0.04 - when you do zero days um we recently had
3.24 - a rising star on that was doing a lot of
6.00 - zero day trades and then he did a bunch
8.32 - of like weekly options and some monthly
10.76 - options against the zero days and a lot
13.72 - of people wrote into us like hundreds of
15.32 - thousands of people watched the videos
16.72 - and they wrote into to us about
19.04 - um uh you know different different
22.36 - mechanics that he was using and we
23.72 - decided to do a little piece of research
25.68 - because we got so many emails on the
28.04 - wings so it's it's
30.92 - $120,000 Vic to sell a one lot triangle
33.92 - in the SPX on a zero day okay just so
36.20 - give you some context 120 grand for a
39.04 - one day Zero DTE that you're holding for
41.76 - trying to make you know a few dollars so
44.00 - it's not really a um it's not really
46.48 - efficient use of capital so so people
49.28 - buy wings and by buying Wings you take
51.48 - the $120,000 down to a couple thousand
53.72 - bucks right so buying the wings makes
56.28 - sense it reduces your um it's just
60.12 - Capital efficient there's nothing else
61.24 - to it it's not a risk thing it's a
63.08 - capital efficiency thing so we've looked
65.08 - at a bunch of different things like how
66.32 - far out should would buy the wings um
69.12 - and should we do the wings in the zero
70.64 - day where they're just going to where
72.08 - they're going to rip or should we do the
73.68 - wings longer dated seven days should we
75.44 - do the wings 30 days out should we do
77.76 - the wings at what particular strike you
79.48 - know just to just to how how wide should
81.72 - they be just to be the
83.36 - most um mechanical and optimize the
86.96 - wings as best we can so that's what this
90.68 - segment is today long dated wings for
93.28 - zero DTS how far out should we go to
96.56 - lose the less the least amount of theta
99.84 - and to give ourselves kind of to
101.44 - optimize the trade so so it's not the
104.44 - most Capital efficient way but it's very
106.72 - Capital efficient and yet it optimizes
109.00 - our our premium risk so undefined risk
111.44 - trades have higher probabilities of
113.52 - profit and upside potential and similar
116.12 - toine RIS strategies so placing these
118.76 - trades in zero DTS however is
120.52 - Impractical because of the regulatory
122.28 - buying power requirement minimums for
125.44 - the spot price and the strikes but
127.72 - neglect time until expiration because of
130.48 - this we've been exploring using very
132.48 - cheap zero DT options to turn our zero
136.24 - DT strategies into wide iron Condors but
139.40 - instead of purchasing the wings that are
141.80 - likely to lose all their value in the
143.88 - zeros what if we use longer dated
146.44 - options to form what we call short-term
149.40 - diagonal or effectively Vic we used to
152.00 - call this like a strangle swap same
153.60 - thing right we're we're selling a front
156.40 - month strangle we're buying a back month
157.96 - strangle to Define our risk but really
160.72 - for Capital efficiency selling a front
162.80 - month strangle buying a back month
163.88 - strangle you can call it you can call
165.96 - the um Double D call whatever you want
168.16 - it doesn't matter it's a strangle swap
170.28 - let's go to next slide it's all done for
173.04 - Capital efficiency so we did a 2-year
175.44 - study using the zero DT SPX options at
179.12 - the market open we sold 20 30 and 40
181.64 - Delta strangles and we paired them with
183.92 - the 30 DTE so going out one month and
187.08 - instead of going to the expected move
188.68 - like we've done in the past which showed
190.08 - to be very effective we went to 510 and
193.04 - 15 Delta options rather than the
195.60 - expected move We examined either closing
198.28 - the strangles if they reached 25% of Max
200.72 - profit or simply leaving them on to
202.44 - expiration the wings were sold back just
204.76 - before the close so we closed everything
207.24 - out there's no holding the wings here a
209.32 - lot of people like to hold the wings
211.52 - just because you know they then they
213.24 - could put the trade on tomorrow they
214.20 - don't have to get in and out we computed
216.12 - The Net Daily performance including the
217.64 - wings in the guts and the resulting
219.32 - buying Powers noting that the averages
221.00 - of the wings um occasionally but but
224.56 - they were sold for you know less than
226.76 - cost all the trades were assumed to be
229.12 - done at Mid price um let's go to the
232.20 - next slide and we'll see some of the
234.84 - results so this is our preferred
238.40 - strangle Vic this is the 20 Delta short
240.92 - strikes this is kind of where we live
243.32 - and if you go the key thing here is if
245.52 - you go your p&l per day with a 25%
248.56 - profit Target including all the losses
250.36 - that you carry forward and everything
251.56 - else what's nice about this is that you
255.76 - make money using the 15 the 10 and the
259.60 - five Delta long strikes but without
262.72 - management meaning you don't take your
264.92 - profits 25% you lose money no matter
266.68 - what you
267.68 - do the average daily p&l is still a
272.52 - positive number and the average Wing
275.28 - cost per day we're just putting it up
276.84 - there about 40 bucks a
278.60 - day so why is this relevant um it is
283.24 - because it shows you how important it is
285.44 - to manage your trades
287.48 - early it's all about managing your
289.36 - trades early that's all it is you know
291.92 - 90% of the time your trades work if you
293.76 - do this it's all about managing trades
295.72 - early let's go to next slide
300.20 - so if you go to the 30 Delta you make
301.72 - more money because you take more risk
303.60 - you're you're you would argue here that
305.48 - your p&l per day losses without
307.72 - management isn't that much worse and you
310.04 - make over double the money so this
312.40 - becomes attractive your wing cost is the
314.44 - same so this actually becomes not bad at
317.12 - 30 Deltas so cons absolutely
320.48 - consideration and if you go to the next
321.72 - slide Beth it's a 40 Delta and if you go
324.84 - to the 40 Deltas here you make even more
326.68 - money and your loss per day isn't that
328.68 - bad either so the argument here is it
331.76 - doesn't matter so much if you do the 20
334.60 - Delta Which is less risk the 30 Delta
336.84 - which is kind of in the middle and the
338.40 - 40 Delta which is a little bit more risk
340.60 - but the reality of all these you get
342.36 - paid for taking the additional risk your
345.44 - average daily p&l is a positive number
348.24 - your wing cost stays the same no matter
350.24 - what and you can pick your poison but
352.32 - the whole key here is managing a
355.12 - 25% that is your entire key that is you
358.96 - know that's the whole
362.04 - game anything jump off the screen at
365.52 - you no no I mean I guess the you I have
371.36 - a I have a the question would be more on
373.88 - like data availability so it's a
375.24 - two-year study and over the last two
377.00 - years every every 10 it's a twoyear
379.20 - study using data every 10 minutes zeros
382.56 - and in the last two years VA has been
384.64 - relatively constrained yep um so that's
388.24 - the only it's not even a caveat just
390.20 - something to just to note that it
392.16 - informs the last the the
394.36 - study it has definitely had an impact um
399.16 - on this study no question about it um
401.84 - the last two years have been um very
405.80 - good for zero DTS if you go to the next
407.64 - slide we'll T tie some of it together so
410.60 - in the takeaways selling zero DT premium
413.04 - is just what Vic said especially close
414.36 - to at the money has been very profitable
416.84 - over the recent years um if you've taken
420.52 - profits aggressively and that's because
422.60 - the market hasn't had a lot of huge
424.72 - moves selling the naked Zer DT premium
429.12 - is prohibited for regulatory reasons
431.36 - however um if you don't buy the wings or
435.68 - you don't diagonalize it the longer
437.88 - dated wings were significantly more
439.48 - expensive than using the zero wings but
443.08 - much of that expense was recouped when
445.60 - the position was sold out it only cost
446.96 - you $40 a day the zeros are much more
449.08 - expensive than that in total um in total
453.16 - the costs were similar but the bprs were
455.76 - higher uh for the diagonals than than
458.52 - iron
459.48 - condors and what did they write here
462.00 - even if um even if it's so much lower
464.28 - than selling the naked triangles yeah I
466.04 - mean of course naked strangles are kind
467.36 - of out of the question um after
469.32 - exploring a variety of
471.08 - ways um to control the binding power for
474.40 - zero DT strangles or zero DT strategies
477.32 - in general um using very cheap zero DT
480.76 - options seems to be the most
482.76 - costeffective way of doing it which is a
485.76 - market measure we did in the past but if
487.24 - you wanted to buy the 7 days or 30 days
491.72 - it's a little bit more expensive it
493.12 - might give you a little bit more peace
494.28 - of mind but you can do that as well it
496.64 - doesn't it doesn't change your
498.36 - probability of profit at
500.96 - all let me ask you a question
504.32 - then knowing seeing that the the 40
507.52 - Delta is most profitable with the
509.52 - management would you knowing that you're
511.92 - preferred is the 20 Delta short strike
514.28 - would you change your trading to go to
516.60 - 40 Delta or would you personally stay
518.68 - with the 20 Delta with the
521.12 - 25% uh management I I I you know it's
524.04 - really funny because we Tony and I tend
526.36 - to use the 25 Delta right between the 20
528.88 - and 30 it's usually what's ever closest
531.56 - so like it's easy to sit here and go
533.12 - we'll use the 20 or the 30 but you have
535.56 - to kind of see what the premium is when
537.12 - you get there and if you looked at it
539.12 - today You' probably go well the 30's got
541.08 - the most juice relative the 20 is too
543.20 - cheap so it it really just depends um
546.68 - we're usually around the TW when we do
548.24 - it early in the morning we're around the
549.36 - 25 if we do it the night before we're at
551.60 - the 20 if we do it a little bit later in
553.64 - the day we're at the 30 so it really
554.92 - just
556.20 - depends we don't do 40s in general but
560.28 - fig we're we're a little behind here so
562.24 - I'm gonna we've been playing catchup all
564.24 - day um we're going to take a short break
566.96 - Victor sitting in for the bat and Tom
569.60 - sof he's Victor Jones and tomorrow
572.08 - you'll have Liz and Jenny it's been a
573.64 - packed week and Tony will be back on
576.36 - Monday Scott's up next Vic we'll take a
578.60 - short break cool
