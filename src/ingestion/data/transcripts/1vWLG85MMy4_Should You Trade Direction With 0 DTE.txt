0.12 - let's do it this is more than off this
3.48 - is a zero DT piece that our research
5.76 - team put together that is I really like
8.96 - it anyway it's they called it to long or
11.92 - not to long I don't even know what that
13.12 - means but based on overnight moves in
16.88 - the SPX the es whatever you want to say
19.72 - what about directionality for zero DTE
22.24 - do you think you get paid by being
25.20 - directional based on an overnight move
27.00 - so let's say the market was up overnight
29.48 - last night do you buy them the Mark goes
31.28 - down overnight do you sell them I mean
33.56 - what do you do based on what happens in
35.84 - the overnight markets when the Market
37.24 - opens the next morning and you're
39.04 - sitting there going all right how do I
40.32 - want to trade these zero DTS I don't
41.76 - want to sell a strangle should I just
43.40 - sell a naked put you know puts or
45.08 - Schmutz puts or Schmutz yeah I mean I
48.68 - don't know how long this study is going
50.16 - to be with with zero in one day I'm
52.68 - gonna imagine it's relatively short um
54.80 - 18 months 18 months yeah and in that
57.32 - time frame we've gone to all-time highs
59.76 - yes so I I got to say if we had a down
62.68 - day and you sold puts for the next day
65.92 - you had to have done well I think it's
68.08 - good I think you get paid sure this is
69.76 - an 18-month study looking at overnight
72.32 - markets and determining whether you
73.60 - should sell puts or calls or just taking
75.24 - a directional shot we're going to give
76.68 - you all the no I was gonna say like I
79.00 - don't think the I'm gonna say the numb
80.28 - is gonna be better for just selling puts
81.72 - versus puts versus calls but I don't
83.64 - think it's G to be I don't think it's
84.76 - going to be as big as you think that
86.08 - would be my guess the there is no
88.24 - question over the last 18 months since
90.40 - we've had zero de options that the
92.60 - market has done really well in fact for
95.16 - the last two years the Market's been up
96.72 - huge and um we're we're basically you
99.32 - know a day off record highs right um so
103.40 - it would be really hard at this point
105.40 - you know to think that that anything you
107.84 - did in the put selling with with respect
109.88 - to put selling would be successful sure
112.32 - let's take a look so it tastes your our
114.00 - core mechanics rely primarily on delta
117.32 - neutral strategies and and and to be
119.20 - fair you know we're pretty directional
121.84 - so it's not that's not totally true but
124.16 - when we when we when we talk about we do
125.84 - research it it's mostly delt Neal but
128.44 - the zero DT options are different
131.20 - different enough from longer dated
132.52 - options that it's worth re-evaluating
134.00 - are our long-standing practices in an
136.72 - efficient market deciding to be long
138.84 - Delta short Delta or neutral Delta is a
140.88 - personal risk preference and Market
143.36 - assumptions but what happens if we pick
146.60 - a side for a de zero DT trades and have
150.12 - overnight moves been helpful as
153.08 - signposts have they been helpful in US
155.40 - picking Direction so we did in this case
159.28 - like we always do now we use 18 months
161.80 - of research and we used all the the
163.60 - basically the tick data every 10 minutes
165.60 - just so we can control the amount of
167.24 - data we considered selling zero DTE
169.72 - options not the day before but at the
172.00 - market opening using Deltas now 35
175.44 - Deltas 25 deltas and 15 Deltas options
179.24 - put sand call not together but puts in
181.08 - calls all the trades were closed to 25%
183.52 - of Max profit so this is not holding all
185.92 - day this is just quickly taking profits
188.20 - if you can we Contra contrasted the
190.64 - Performance Based on the size and
191.88 - direction of the overnight moves did the
193.72 - X rise or fall overnight was that by
196.00 - more than a half a percent and did the S
198.64 - change in absolute value by more than
200.68 - half a percent and we did everything at
203.04 - mid-price so you can add a little or
204.76 - subtract a little which however you want
206.28 - to look at it so short 16 Delta puts now
210.28 - this is the one that if you were ever
212.40 - going to have one that's going to be
213.80 - probably the most I'm not saying the
215.76 - best bang for your buck but I'm saying
217.68 - you're gonna have the highest win
218.68 - percentage this is going to be it
220.40 - because Tony and I both said we've been
221.68 - up for 18 straight months this has been
224.04 - kind of the layup I mean sure I didn't I
226.08 - don't do this but this has been a layup
228.08 - hindsight right I mean in hindsight the
230.68 - win percentage overall 97% which is
233.84 - insane if the xpx rose overnight 98% if
236.80 - the if it fell this is selling puts 96%
239.76 - % if the SPX Ro it didn't matter what
241.84 - happened half a point down up whatever
244.36 - it is you made money if you just sold 16
247.24 - Delta puts on the opening in the zero
249.56 - DTS every single day since we since we
253.16 - had zero DT options except for today
255.80 - you'd be doing quite well right and the
258.28 - day is not over but sure you'd be doing
260.08 - quite quite well let's go next slide so
262.32 - now we're going to look at the 15 Delta
265.04 - calls would you have done as well
267.24 - considering it's been on bull market the
269.28 - win percentages are really high 92%
271.72 - overall the win percentage is actually
273.56 - higher than I thought here and and the
275.36 - interesting thing here is 100% win
277.12 - percentage at the S Fe F fell by more
279.16 - than a half a percent overnight and a
281.36 - half a percent is nothing I mean let's
283.24 - put it where it is 25 20 2528 SPO
286.96 - handles yeah exactly yeah but but here's
289.88 - the crazy thing Tony overall you lost
292.16 - money yeah that is crazy overall you
294.24 - lost $80 a trade if you sold puts you
296.44 - made a lot of money if you sold calls
298.72 - you lost money even though at a 92% win
300.80 - rate and more than more than I had
303.28 - suspected prior to the to seeing the
305.28 - stud yeah pretty much selling calls only
307.12 - worked if the snps had a had a pretty
311.20 - big down move overnight as you go up
313.40 - step up a class in Delta here to the 25
315.56 - Deltas your short puts still worked
318.56 - really well of course you know
320.40 - regardless of the market overall 95%
323.48 - your average daily p&l $118 overall
326.44 - short puts worked really well the the 15
328.72 - Delta or the 25 Delta if you go to the
331.40 - next slide which is the calls it's a
333.16 - very different story you lost money
335.20 - pretty much no matter what you did
336.52 - unless the S&P was down big overnight
338.52 - the only time to sell calls was when the
340.60 - S&P was down big overnight because it
342.04 - didn't it must not have reversed against
344.36 - you that many times or the volatility
346.68 - got you know so high that even if it did
348.64 - reverse it didn't reach that number
350.92 - again just another way of saying you
352.32 - know when volatility is high you you you
354.16 - can almost do you know you can do both
356.20 - sides and that's only when the S&P by
358.28 - the way was down more than a half a
359.96 - percent overnight as measured by we put
362.32 - SPX here but it's really the the es
364.52 - Futures is how they do that judge that
366.48 - the win percentages were still really
367.96 - high but you overall lost money so
370.28 - selling zero DTE overall on the call
373.20 - side whether it's 15 Delta or 25 Delta
375.88 - did not work unless there was a big down
377.60 - move overnight selling puts Works no
379.64 - matter what let's go to the $35 much you
382.04 - said it from the very beginning on the
383.40 - 35 Delta I mean the win rate's still
386.08 - ridiculous and you can see here you even
388.36 - made more money right you killed it with
390.24 - 35 Delta puts I mean those are you know
392.88 - the the bigger the put the more money
394.36 - you made that's because over the last 18
396.88 - months instead of being up 53% of the
399.40 - time the Market's been up closer to you
401.36 - know over 60% of the time that's why
403.80 - these numbers are huge if you go to the
405.80 - calls I'm sure it's not going to be as
407.52 - pretty and go to the next slide Beth 35
410.08 - Delta calls and every number is pretty
412.16 - much a loser unless we were down big yep
414.80 - y so the the takeaway from this is with
417.96 - the Zero DS for the last 18 months if
420.20 - you wanted to get long you did really
422.04 - well selling puts on the opening didn't
423.68 - matter what what Delta if you wanted to
425.76 - get Short Selling calls you did really
428.28 - poorly period That's the fact Jack
431.36 - that's the fact unless the S&P was down
433.52 - big that's only thing let's go to the
435.48 - next slide Beth so takeaways over the
437.72 - past 18 months short out of the money
439.40 - zero DT puts have generally been a
441.88 - winning trade provided they were managed
443.56 - aggressively remember these are all
445.20 - managed at 25% of Max profit so nothing
448.52 - went to the end of the day so you had a
450.24 - day like we had one day where we opened
452.16 - down like 100 points the S&P we closed
454.16 - up but you had a chance to manage that
456.36 - at 25% you were out 25% of the profit
459.44 - yes correct right a large overnight gain
461.36 - in the was the only negatively
463.52 - correlated factor for short putut
465.12 - success short calls on the other hand
467.00 - were generally successful only after
468.80 - large overnight losses or large
470.92 - overnight drops I'm sorry the efficient
472.84 - market hypothesis says that we shouldn't
474.76 - put too much faith in looking at past
477.52 - price moves for making our trading
480.00 - decisions but if you decide to be
481.80 - directional with your Z trades
483.76 - considering overnight s moves or
486.16 - overnight es moves is a reasonable place
489.56 - to start the numbers are pretty
491.96 - remarkable as Spanky would say of the
494.00 - hour gang remarkable
