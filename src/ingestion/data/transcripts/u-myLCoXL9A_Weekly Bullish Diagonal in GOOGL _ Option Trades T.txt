0.08 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.20 - the B batist and I have a trade idea for
3.72 - you today February 20th
7.20 - 2025 and this one is actually inspired
10.64 - by an email that was sent to me so
12.72 - you're going to want to watch this
13.72 - because it's one of your own somebody
15.60 - from out there who had a question to me
17.76 - you can always email me at bat
20.84 - tasty.com or just do a comment right
23.68 - there on YouTube I answer those too love
25.80 - to hear from you but first as we always
27.56 - do let's see what's going on in the
29.04 - market even p is finally having a day
31.28 - where they're moving around 1% down 52
34.28 - handles on &p volume of just under
37.76 - 700,000 that's pretty good volume
39.88 - because you'll remember when you watch
41.60 - the show that we always talk about the
43.76 - volume when it's being low and it was
45.76 - around 800,000 at 2:30 in the afternoon
48.72 - Central Standard time you got 700,000
50.96 - already a busy day NASDAQ down 205
54.08 - Russell down 31 Russell the weakest of
56.08 - the group but the Dow down 576 also the
59.12 - weakest of the group on a percentage
60.56 - basis the odd thing volatility not
62.96 - really getting out of its own way up 20
65.60 - cents even the S&P is about 10 handles
68.12 - off of their lows uh volatility already
71.60 - off of its lows by about 15 or 20 cents
74.96 - not giving a lot of movement or a lot of
77.56 - um green light to this down move in the
80.64 - market I would think volatility would
81.96 - have uh uptick a little bit more key on
84.40 - volatility uh volatility starts up
86.72 - ticking then this Market is going to go
88.80 - lower today B bonds up 13 ticks bonds
91.76 - finally trading over 115 all right as I
94.64 - always do I like to look at my watch
96.68 - list I go to my watch list here I have
98.24 - my high option volume list you can put
100.32 - any list that you want here you can make
101.88 - your own list and save it or you can go
104.12 - to some of the curated list that we have
106.60 - here I like the high option volume list
108.84 - I know my son likes the uh S&P 100 or
111.44 - the NASDAQ 100 I like to click on these
114.08 - earnings so I get rid of all the
115.76 - earnings in these stocks I like to look
117.88 - at something that has high IV rank when
120.52 - looking to sell premium and I go through
122.48 - these and find out which one is a name
124.88 - that I like to trade I have two or three
127.52 - that I'm going to show you before I get
129.20 - to the trade I'm going to show you why
130.28 - I'm not making a trade in Royal
132.08 - Caribbean because Royal Caribbean really
133.52 - fits me here here's a stock that was a
135.48 - high flyer it's down almost 10% today
138.12 - $23 now it's just down 25 a moment ago
141.24 - would have looked like to have done
142.68 - something in here so I looked at the
144.44 - trade page um I'm sorry going into the
147.24 - table mode that's what I like but you
148.72 - can go to curve mode you can go to
150.60 - crypto if you want to P trading analysis
152.80 - you can do anything you want the
154.28 - platform is quite Dynamic and I looked
156.04 - at April options no earnings looming
158.32 - because we already uh did away with that
160.60 - I have the open interest on here this is
162.60 - not volume for the day this is open
165.64 - interest there's just not enough open
167.88 - interest in here markets actually get a
169.92 - little bit wide too when you have a $2
172.12 - option that's 50 cents wide or a 50 Cent
175.04 - option that's almost a dollar and change
177.24 - wide here on the 185 puts it just makes
180.04 - it untradable in my you have to have
183.76 - liquidity so Royal Caribbean uh has to
187.32 - go away I go back to my list here uh why
190.08 - did I pick Royal Caribbean I should show
191.76 - you that that was probably the most
192.88 - important thing the ivy rank was up 10%
195.88 - over the last five days and the ivy rank
198.16 - was 75 one of the highest Ivy ranks on
200.72 - the board in the high option volume list
203.20 - and then also the
205.12 - 10% uh ivx that's the the implied Val
210.12 - change over the last 5 days is up 10% I
213.20 - really love to put on a premium selling
215.24 - trade uh when you see that number so big
218.12 - all right next one that I was going to
219.56 - look at was
221.24 - INTC which is Intel and Intel you see it
224.40 - down here on the bottom a good IV rank
226.76 - of 75 the ivx 5day change good not as
231.16 - great as that uh trade that we just saw
233.12 - in Royal Caribbean so if there was
234.52 - between the two I'd probably like to do
235.76 - Royal Caribbean but it's up three and a
237.76 - half% so let's look at why I wouldn't
240.00 - put a trade on an Intel no earnings
242.08 - looming in April we'll take a look at
244.24 - that good monthly implied volatility 56%
247.56 - that's big but you look at this it's
249.44 - only a $25 stock when you go to around a
252.72 - one standard deviation or even a 20
254.92 - Delta option 25 Delta option which has a
258.00 - 50% chance of a touch remember that by
260.48 - the way you're only getting around a150
263.04 - a lot of these trades that I put on for
264.80 - you at least trying to lead a horse to
266.96 - water here I close at a dollish profit
269.76 - profit there's not a lot of um buying
272.04 - power you're going to use here so the
273.36 - buying power to credit receive ratio is
277.00 - quite High $150 to to 250 bucks the
281.08 - probably profit is good at 66% but you
284.28 - have to go into this trade knowing that
286.84 - you're going to be in it for the
288.84 - duration probably much more than the
291.28 - three weeks that I like to be in a trade
293.12 - you're probably going to have to be into
294.36 - this Trade four or five uh weeks and
297.76 - then to make 50% on this trade it's
299.48 - really only around 75 cents I don't know
302.04 - to me it's like watching uh paint dry if
304.56 - you had a a directional opinion on here
307.52 - and you wanted to go with a directional
309.20 - trade in Intel by selling premium then I
312.12 - would have no problem with that I don't
313.68 - have a directional bias in Intel so I
315.76 - was just looking at a completely um
318.80 - delta neutral type trade you'll notice
321.00 - the negative one Delta and if you go out
323.04 - to the 15 Delta on on each side here
326.36 - you're going to get only a dollar uh
328.40 - total on the trade just not enough
330.28 - premium uh for me although it is a good
332.92 - buying power to credit receive ratio and
335.00 - that's what uh makes a lot of people put
336.88 - on these trades especially in smaller
338.88 - accounts I'd rather you do a defined
340.64 - risk trade in a in a in a larger price
343.52 - stock than do a selling premium trade in
346.12 - a smaller price stock which brings me to
349.00 - the stock that I'm going to trade
350.76 - because this emailer uh sent it into me
354.32 - I decided to do what they wanted to do I
356.20 - figured take a good shot they want to
357.80 - take a look at Google let's go to a
359.24 - chart of Google first here is their
361.36 - opinion not my opinion necessarily but I
363.52 - don't hate it I I like the idea that's
365.76 - why I did I would never do a trade just
367.76 - because somebody wrote in or I was
369.08 - listening to a podcast or something else
370.68 - like that the Assumption or the strategy
373.80 - or the setup in the in the stock has to
377.60 - meaning the monthly apply volatility has
379.64 - to fit your assumption okay there their
382.64 - feeling here at Google is you know what
384.52 - it might go sideways to a little bit
386.08 - higher I'm okay with that too Google has
388.36 - a good um
390.12 - uh follows the market it has a good
392.72 - correlation uh to the market typically
395.08 - uh relatively strong it has not been
397.20 - strong as of late had this big gap down
400.40 - uh back here uh in early February it's
402.68 - been going sideways and consolidating
404.60 - they said they liked it on a chart
406.44 - there's another Gap here that they said
408.00 - that might fill one of these two gaps
410.36 - they're going to take the upside I'm not
411.88 - a chartist I don't really care about
413.20 - that but I like that the ivy rank was
415.24 - only 19 for the strategy they're doing
418.24 - so what let's take a look at they want
419.96 - to do uh first before I do that let's go
422.44 - back into our list here and see where
424.76 - Google is the IV rank is basically
426.84 - unchanged over the last five days the
429.20 - the ivx 5day change is basically going
431.28 - change over the last five days the IV
433.36 - rank is low so I'm not going to look to
436.00 - sell premium in here and they didn't
437.88 - want to sell premium in here either so
440.12 - they're omnidirectional slightly long in
443.56 - Google they asked me to come up with a
445.52 - trade where I'm buying April options and
448.48 - selling out of the money options in the
451.40 - weekly options so what do I have to do
453.40 - here the first thing I have to look at
454.80 - here is what is the monthly implied
457.12 - volatility of all of these months well
459.72 - they're basically the same I like that I
462.44 - don't I would prefer these to be higher
464.40 - in the front month the 8 day the 15 days
467.00 - the 22 days the 29 days um than what I'm
470.16 - paying but I certainly don't want the
472.40 - April volatility to be significantly
475.40 - higher than the than the daily or weekly
479.04 - uh pre prium that I'm going to be
480.48 - selling because I'm going to be doing
481.92 - this each week so this is a this is a
484.08 - trial by putting something on that makes
487.20 - logical sense that somebody wants to do
489.32 - to try to accumulate in a smaller
491.40 - account accumulate Google because they
494.04 - like it they're bullish on the stock you
495.68 - have to have the same assumption so I
497.84 - went to the uh April options with a
499.88 - monthly applied volatility of 28 I would
501.96 - not want this April volatility to be
504.88 - three four five points higher than the
509.52 - monthly implied volatility that I'm
511.12 - selling in February and March eventually
513.20 - so I would like it at least on Entry
514.96 - because that's all we can control to be
516.76 - the same or this April volatility to be
519.60 - lower all right so what am I doing here
521.72 - I'm buying the April uh um uh April 185
528.36 - calls the just at the money call or just
530.72 - out of the money they were in the money
532.08 - or right at the money yesterday before
533.80 - the stock was down so I'm buying the 185
536.52 - calls in April they have around a 50
538.52 - Delta and I'm going to sell the weekly
541.92 - options with eight days to go I'm going
544.32 - to go a strike out of the money and sell
546.68 - the 127 and a halfs now I did this for
552.08 - $6.2 you can do it uh better than me by
555.12 - a couple of pennies maybe a nickel or
556.76 - two I did it sorry not $52
561.04 - $62 um Mid price right now is 5.95 so
564.68 - you can do it much better than I did
566.48 - obviously the buying power is exactly
568.28 - what you're going to pay for
570.08 - uh pay for it let's say you were able to
571.72 - get filled at $5.95 then your buying
573.96 - power is going to be
576.64 - $595 uh Delta you're controlling 18
579.68 - shares of stock your Theta Decay is
583.16 - positive $85 $867 cents a day so I like
587.28 - that positive uh uh Theta Decay Delta to
591.64 - match my assumption they want to be
593.12 - slightly uh long long 18 Deltas um
597.28 - buying power effect is good at 595
600.08 - why is there no pop on this trade that's
602.96 - a great question why is there no pop on
604.96 - this trade because we can't predict what
607.76 - volatility is going to do in either one
611.48 - of these months in either one of these
614.08 - months now you can go to the analyze Tab
617.44 - and look to put on this trade and then
620.48 - move the volatility if you want to to
622.60 - see it up or down what happens but let
624.92 - me tell you something before you even
626.44 - start doing all of that what you really
628.20 - want the stock to do is you want the
630.28 - stock to slowly go up to 87 uh and a
634.12 - half and stop with the next two or three
637.00 - days before expiration when we will look
639.68 - to roll this trade on around Wednesday
643.36 - or Thursday of next week and I'm going
646.12 - to roll it to the March calls I'll roll
649.12 - them here now why would I put on this
651.40 - trade in the weekly options when I don't
653.60 - usually put on trades in weekly options
655.92 - well I went through each month you'll
657.84 - notice here that the markets are P or
659.60 - two wide in every month plenty of open
663.12 - interest uh in in all of them plenty of
666.60 - good tight markets in each one of them
669.12 - so the scenario or the assumption that
672.00 - the person had fits the implied
674.56 - volatility and it fits the amount of of
677.80 - volume in Google all we need to for them
680.60 - to get right is is if Google goes higher
683.00 - to find risk trade selling premium
686.72 - getting the right Delta that you want
688.52 - and making sure on Entry that you put on
691.96 - the proper uh implied volatility skew
695.72 - that you have in here now remember you
697.60 - can go into uh the follow page and see
701.32 - these trades ahead of time all I did was
703.96 - click on Bob the trader that's to me
705.80 - here's the trade I did at 1016 the stock
708.48 - NOW is about 10 cents lower uh than
711.00 - where I put on the trade um the ivr was
714.32 - around 20 it's about the same right now
716.52 - I paid like I told you
717.96 - $6.2 and I asked you it's a new trade
720.52 - idea inspired by an emailer listen to my
