0.16 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.20 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
3.76 - you today uh
6.76 - September 26 2024 but first as I always
11.16 - do let's take a quick look at the market
13.28 - and see what's going on because it's
14.96 - been quite a market &ps are up 13 you
18.68 - might think that's a lot but if you look
20.48 - &ps were 5830 they were almost 40
24.00 - handles higher they were up over 50
26.04 - handles this morning uh they are now
28.40 - only up 14 the NASDAQ has had a 300
31.52 - Point uh move in the market already this
33.88 - morning but it's still up 58 or 57
36.64 - Russell up 18 and the Dow of
40.72 - 2011 a lot of this is due to Chinese
43.36 - stocks to the upside and
46.00 - smci to the downside smci a little
49.20 - report came out they might be cooking
51.04 - the books at smci I have no idea the
53.96 - first thing I want to do is take a look
55.72 - at smci I noticed it had earnings
57.92 - November 6th which is before the
59.96 - November expiration so I was already not
62.64 - uh that Keen on trading smci and then I
65.72 - looked at the markets the markets are
67.28 - quite wide so I said you know what I'm
69.28 - not trading uh smci today at all so I
73.08 - went back to my high option volume list
76.24 - I clicked on the earnings so that I
78.20 - could have the earnings out of the way
80.40 - or at least look at the stocks with high
82.96 - option volume that have earnings after
86.12 - expiration expiration uh being the 50
88.88 - you notice something here JD Chinese
91.92 - stock High Ivy rank up almost 4% in the
94.92 - last 5 days Ivy rank of 47 paloalto
98.56 - network doing the same although today's
101.28 - um volatility is down uh I don't know
104.56 - what XP is uh so well they interested in
107.84 - trading that but a name popped up here
110.44 - Buu look at this up almost 2% over the
113.56 - last 5 days and it's got an ivy rank of
116.12 - 58 higher than JD and plus J a $37 stock
121.32 - makes a little bit harder um to sell
123.88 - premium in a smaller price stock all
126.48 - things being equal the premiums are
128.32 - smaller even though if they're higher
130.24 - relative to that stock big change there
132.80 - $410 in JD big change in bu but Buu well
137.24 - off of its highs too look at this Buu up
139.68 - almost $4 higher than where it is right
142.28 - now sometimes you can't always catch
144.00 - everything uh at the top and the bottoms
146.60 - the low is right about where it's
148.32 - trading right now as the Market is kind
150.52 - of making lows now I'm going to get a
152.60 - little bit well you might suggest that I
154.88 - might want to trade higher in bu but I'm
157.56 - going to trade a little bit lower or
159.44 - look for a little bit of selloff in bu
161.84 - do let me show you what I'm going to do
164.12 - before I do that you'll notice that
165.88 - earnings of the 19th that's after
167.84 - expiration let's take a look at that
169.48 - right here on the option chain you'll
170.76 - see this Big E which means earnings
173.28 - you'll see this purple line is after
176.04 - expiration it also has the date here
178.24 - November 19th you'll see the these
180.16 - options are November 15 50 days to go 45
184.72 - being optimal taking trades off around
187.64 - 21 all things being optimal uh you'll be
190.88 - looking to any position you put on in
192.56 - October You' be looking to move from
194.40 - October to November today tomorrow
198.00 - yesterday the day before Monday of next
201.20 - week Tuesday of next week but it's that
203.60 - time frame when you should be looking to
205.04 - roll positions so you definitely at
207.36 - least I am opening all my positions in
210.00 - November so what am I going to look to
211.40 - do here in buou first thing I look at
214.16 - markets are good not great matter of
216.00 - fact some of these out of the money
217.40 - options are quite wide
220.40 - 87114 a 10 cents wide here got a good
223.68 - Mark in the 20s here look at these puts
226.32 - out of the money puts 20 cents wide here
229.24 - so be careful with your pricing when you
231.32 - put anything in uh especially if you're
233.56 - looking to sell or even if you're
234.80 - looking to buy but if you're looking to
236.24 - sell if I was looking to to sell these
238.40 - puts whether theyd be naked or to spread
240.64 - I would be going well over the the
244.20 - $193 mid price I would be going you know
247.84 - a197 $198 and then walk it down watch
251.52 - the stock uh if the stock starts up
253.56 - ticking maybe be a little bit more
254.84 - aggressive uh with my pricing a little
256.96 - bit lower because again this would be a
258.92 - long Delta position if stock is going
261.44 - higher that means it's going the
262.68 - opposite direction from where I need to
264.68 - get filled if it starts to go lower
266.36 - maybe I keep my price where it is only
267.96 - move at one penny or two pennies again
270.04 - I'm just trying to show you how to um uh
272.80 - play the market as you're watching the
274.64 - market to see what's going on all right
276.24 - what am I looking to do I'm going to
278.88 - look to do a ratio spread here a call
282.24 - ratio spread now the call ratio spread
284.88 - before I put it up here is going to have
286.92 - no risk to the downside and for that
290.28 - reason alone if it has no risk to one
292.92 - side that has to be a bearish position
295.56 - if it has no risk to the downside if it
297.32 - has no risk to the upside I would call a
300.12 - bullish position if you can't lose money
301.76 - in One Direction then that's the
303.44 - direction it has to be but ratio spreads
306.32 - are quite unique where they have a big
308.32 - tent or a big sweet spot right where
311.00 - your short strike is which is actually
312.80 - in the opposite direction that you want
315.08 - the stock to go to let me explain I like
317.92 - to buy the option that's around that
320.92 - 30ish uh probability of success you see
323.48 - here with $5 wide strikes not dollar
326.72 - wide strikes meaning there's no 106 107
329.80 - 108 makes it a little bit more difficult
332.04 - I'm going at default to the 110 calls
334.16 - I'm going to buy the 110 calls and look
337.12 - at these markets a nice and tight now
339.08 - I'm going to sell the 120 calls now I'm
341.96 - trying to go $10 wide on here typically
345.76 - I would do a 1 by two spread great
348.52 - probability of profit
350.44 - 87% um is a little bit of short Delta 16
353.76 - short Deltas I want to be short uh bu
357.36 - you'll notice here this green line gives
359.48 - you you that uh probability of success
361.64 - where you make money there's no risk to
363.88 - the downside your upside risk is a
366.40 - little bit above 120 let me explain why
369.84 - cuz I've bought one of the 110 calls and
372.16 - I sold two of the 215 calls I'm long the
376.20 - 110 115 call spread one time I know
380.40 - there's two of those give me a minute
381.96 - I'm long that one time if I just had
383.68 - that spread on one time that spread
386.64 - could be worth $5 which bring brings my
388.76 - break even to one 12 but I'm short one
392.12 - extra 115 call so I have to account for
396.84 - that which gives me risk above 120
400.28 - actually
401.40 - 121 uh approximately 121 to the upside
405.76 - now my best case scenario at expiration
410.32 - 50 days from now is a stock is at 115
414.00 - and I make
415.56 - $500 plus the credit I received that's
418.52 - why my Max profit 638 but that's not the
420.92 - trade I'm doing I'm going to try to take
422.76 - on a little well I don't know if you're
425.64 - going to want to consider it a little
426.76 - bit more risk or a little bit less risk
428.84 - but you tell me I think contracts equal
431.00 - risk so I'm going to say it's a little
432.32 - bit more risky even though I can make
434.40 - more money on this trade instead of
436.68 - being one by two I'm going to go to one
440.84 - by3 on this spread one by three on this
445.16 - spread meaning I'm buying one of the 110
447.68 - calls I'm selling three three of the 120
451.68 - calls and I'm using
454.68 - $4,200 in buying power you notice what I
457.56 - did the 1 by two it was significantly
459.84 - less buying power I'll give it to you
461.32 - again even if you were looking to do
463.12 - this trade one by two you'd be using
465.68 - $2,200 in buying power this is a small
468.24 - debit I like to do it for a credit I
470.48 - like my credit to be over a dollar cuz
472.20 - all things being equal if I get the move
474.44 - I want this spread is going to collapse
476.64 - quite nicely and I can maybe make myself
478.48 - a buck or two on this overall spread
481.12 - using $4,200 I'm going one by two uh 1
485.28 - by3 my break even on this spread is
487.68 - going to be a little bit different than
488.80 - a 1 by two let me explain to you I'm
490.80 - long one of the 110 calls work with me
493.56 - here for a second just like we did a
494.96 - moment ago and I'm short only one of the
499.28 - 120 calls that spread would be worth $10
502.76 - at expiration if the stock was sitting
505.92 - right at
507.68 - 120 now since I had two extra calls
511.44 - remember cuz I'm 1 by3 but I have that
513.76 - $10 that I could
516.24 - make I have a Max profit of $173 because
519.56 - that's about where it's trading right
520.76 - now now you can do this spread better
522.56 - than I put it on I put it on at a156 and
525.72 - a $1.70 that was when the stock was only
528.56 - up around $6
531.00 - $66.50 I'll show you that um in the uh
534.32 - follow page in just one second now at
536.84 - expiration if it goes right to 120 I
539.04 - make my $1,000 I don't anticipate the
542.76 - stock going here because I have short
544.68 - Delta but if it did I got a 91% pop my
548.40 - break even would be 125 cuz I have two
552.84 - extra 120 calls and I have a
556.28 - $1,000 on this Max profit on this call
559.64 - spread I have so that means on those two
562.44 - calls would be $5 a piece my break even
565.04 - is approximately
568.20 - $125 with the stock trading
570.92 - $101 and change and only a $10 expected
575.52 - move that $10 expected move comes into
578.08 - play here because that's right where my
580.08 - long strike is all things being equal if
582.92 - it has a expected move over the next 50
586.08 - days that the option pricing is putting
587.68 - in that brings us right to 110 111 these
590.68 - 120 calls will be worth nothing these
592.80 - 110 calls will be right at the money
594.56 - they'll have the most premium in them
596.36 - those will be the ones I'm long and
598.28 - everybody uh is happy now what do I
601.16 - really want to happen tomorrow this
603.12 - stock opens down $7 and this spread
605.96 - instead of being a$1 70ish and change in
609.24 - credit would probably be um zero or
613.60 - maybe a small debit and I could take
615.72 - this trade off for a nice buck buck 50
618.12 - profit overall in Buu now remember
621.16 - something Buu uh if a stock can move
624.04 - almost 10% today off of its highs
627.04 - remember was significantly higher 104
630.12 - uh today so that's over a 10% move
632.80 - nothing is guaranteed here but I like
634.68 - the probability of success 91% seems
637.52 - good to me positive Theta $85 for the
640.88 - risk that I'm taking so if that
642.68 - volatility contracts that we saw over
645.36 - the last 5 days instead of it being
647.04 - higher actually goes lower and maybe the
649.40 - stock even goes lower the stock doesn't
651.52 - move but volatility comes in we don't
653.68 - have to worry about earnings these out
655.84 - of the money options should lose more
658.80 - premium
659.80 - faster than my at the money option would
663.04 - be 23 short Deltas means you definitely
665.44 - want the stock to go lower Max profit of
668.48 - $1,173 depending on where you sell it at
671.44 - right now it's 167 you can see here the
673.72 - markets get a little bit wider they get
675.68 - a little bit tighter um I would Suspect
678.16 - with the stock right here up to $740
680.72 - you'd be able to get filled at 175 174
683.44 - 173 or 172 if you're watching this now
686.68 - listen if you had watched this earlier
688.80 - today
689.76 - um or you have a tasty trade account
692.92 - you'll always see me right on the follow
694.84 - page I'm Bob the trader you click on
698.04 - this you'll see 6 minutes later I sold
700.44 - it at
701.48 - a156 um with the stock trading uh just
704.60 - under 101 and with the stock trading
707.04 - just over 101 I was able to sell it at
710.40 - $1.70 so this is a trade that will have
714.48 - movement to it if the stock goes in the
716.76 - opposite direction obviously you'll be
718.68 - able to collect more credit and if it
720.92 - goes lower we'll be able to buy it back
723.52 - for a profit you'll notice here that I
725.76 - always put in a description it's a rare
728.24 - 1x3 I say rare 1x3 because I'm using
731.48 - more buying power um and I like to do
733.92 - these typically at 1 by2 it's a call
736.72 - ratio spread with no risk to the
738.92 - downside you'll notice 6 minutes later
741.28 - all I Ed was another trunch here's where
744.00 - we get in trouble remember size kills so
747.00 - keep your positions small if 1x3 is too
751.04 - um uh too much buying power for you or
753.52 - too many units for you and you should
755.32 - stay away from this type of trade I like
757.84 - it because it's a little bit wider I've
759.36 - got a lot of money sitting on the
760.60 - sidelines my last three two or three
763.04 - trades that I've made on this podcast
764.92 - have all been um uh uh iron Condors with
769.24 - defined risk Buu does not have defined
772.16 - risk I've been saving my uh my my powder
