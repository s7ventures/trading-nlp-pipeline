0.76 - we got a lot of questions we've done a
2.84 - lot of zero DTE um we've done a ton of
7.24 - zero studies we've done none with long
10.64 - buying strangles uh buying straddles
13.24 - buying strangles buying calls buying
14.88 - puts we've got a ton of emails saying
17.24 - hey show me the other side do you think
19.48 - you make or lose money by buying premium
21.88 - in um long zero day yes oh I mean I
26.20 - obviously if they go out to our area I'm
30.04 - to say no it's going to be it's going to
32.44 - be hard or or the the draw down would be
35.24 - too large um to sustain it to become
39.08 - profitable they go closer and they
41.36 - manage at a you've watched these you've
44.64 - traded them they move quickly I mean
46.32 - there are times to manage these for
48.44 - small $50 winners where maybe buying
51.40 - premium you know if you're Nimble could
53.72 - be okay in the zero days if you're close
55.56 - to the money surprising results are
58.04 - going to show that um
61.24 - sorry allergies um surprising results
63.48 - are I haven't seen this I don't know
65.12 - that um if you're very Nimble yes you
69.00 - can make money oh okay cool go untight
71.68 - everybody's replaceable Tom everybody is
73.72 - replaceable everybody is replaceable
75.32 - zero DT Marketplace in liquid
76.80 - underlyings has been one of the most
77.96 - profitable arenas for retail traders in
79.68 - recent times at Tasty our preference for
81.80 - high probability trades leads us to make
83.56 - mostly making or mostly taking short
85.84 - premium positions in a two-sided
87.76 - efficient market Traders should be able
89.60 - to profit by using either short or long
92.48 - options if aggressive management has
94.68 - been the key for success in selling Zer
96.80 - DT premium what kind of approach has
99.36 - been most successful for purchasers now
101.92 - I'm going to put a little bit of I don't
103.60 - know where they're going with this but I
104.84 - want to say it beforehand okay thank you
106.60 - for the CB for sponsoring all this if
108.72 - we're using mid price intraday let's
111.84 - just say there are times when you can't
114.40 - get filled at Mid price so some of these
116.40 - results I would skew them down a little
119.16 - bit just because you're going to have to
120.88 - give up a nickel to get filled on a we
122.40 - always say watch go to the next slide so
125.40 - um as you can see the last bullet point
127.36 - here is all trades were assumed to
128.72 - exercise at Mid price because long
130.92 - options are inherently defined risk no
132.76 - additional buying power reduction
135.04 - controlling options is required so you
136.64 - don't have to buy the wings but they're
138.80 - specific in here to make sure you
140.44 - understand that you're probably going to
141.76 - give up a nickel off mid price very good
143.60 - I'm glad okay same thing 18 months worth
145.28 - of data we can purchase zero DT
147.36 - strangles at the market open using the
148.88 - 20 and 30 Delta
150.40 - we contrasted the performance of closing
152.68 - the winning trades if their profits
154.00 - exceeded a certain percentage or closing
156.24 - the losing trades if their losses
158.48 - crossed given um losses cross given
161.36 - percentages of their Max potential loss
164.36 - so we're trying to control losses here
166.16 - do everything we can let's go to the um
169.56 - let's go to the next slide something fix
172.60 - this okay so the first thing is buying
176.00 - 30 Delta strangles that's buying the put
178.00 - and buying the call what's interesting
179.60 - here is that if you close them quickly
182.08 - for a profit of 10% now how much is a 30
186.20 - Delta um caller put I'm going to guess
188.52 - it's probably going to be around boy I'm
190.44 - going to guess probably 12 premium you
192.64 - talking about yeah zero day yeah 30
195.40 - Delta yeah you're looking at well right
198.56 - now around five right now about five but
201.32 - what is it on the what do you think what
202.60 - is on the opening about seven or eight
205.40 - um maybe nine that's hard for me to say
208.20 - well you know what I'll go one day just
209.80 - so maybe we going to strap out it's
211.52 - about 1112 on each I'm going go eight or
213.84 - n okay eight or nine so 10% would be 80
217.04 - C 77% chance Clos a 25% profit uh 67 um%
223.00 - chance 50% profit a dollar so so the
226.16 - daily p&l for managing your winners um
230.52 - was was pretty positive on buying 30
233.36 - Delta strangles um everything on this
235.36 - slide is good that I like the 67 you
238.68 - know 58% chance making a little money
241.20 - okay cool with that let's go next slide
243.20 - that's managing your winners that
244.60 - doesn't mean you can't be short the same
246.28 - thing and still make money either yep
247.92 - yep okay so this is if you try to manage
250.56 - your losers now this means make
252.52 - adjustments everything else and this is
253.76 - where you get into trouble it's really
255.48 - hard to manage your losers when you're
257.76 - trading short premium it's easy to
260.28 - manage your losers when you're Trading
262.12 - long premium it's really hard to manage
264.28 - losers yeah so the the first we always
266.76 - said this this is almost like your hedge
268.28 - when do you get out of your hedge EX
269.72 - exactly so so if you're managing your
272.44 - long premium trades at a certain
274.80 - percentage of whatever you paid for it
276.92 - that works but if you're trying to
278.56 - manage it andjust for losers oh that
280.76 - does not work yeah yeah look at these
282.88 - win percentages really bad let's go to
285.40 - next slide so it went to the 20 Delta
287.24 - strangles a little further out of the
289.00 - money and you still made money across
291.16 - the board you didn't make as much money
293.60 - and to be fair if you're going to buy
295.16 - the strangle you're better off buying
296.28 - the 30 Delta strangle than the 20 Delta
298.80 - because you you basically have higher
300.64 - percentages across the board and you
301.88 - make more money so you're better off
303.40 - buying the 20 the 20 Delta strangle if
305.76 - you go to the next slide Beth it's it's
308.68 - the losses for 20 Delta strangle yeah
311.04 - and you can see here if you tried to
312.36 - manage your losses o really rough 5% win
316.68 - percentage 7% 14% this is dark um this
320.32 - is dark well it is you can't manag the
322.40 - losses it's really hard so so that was
325.88 - that's the takeaway here managing
327.56 - winners possible managing losers
329.28 - impossible from a long premium side
331.48 - let's go to the next slide so over the
333.36 - past 18 month zero DT Traders could make
335.88 - money on either shorting or longing
337.68 - strangles that the market opened the key
339.28 - was using the right management mechanics
341.44 - I think we're the only group that's ever
343.24 - researched this at this kind of detail
345.68 - for long zero TT strangles managing
347.92 - losers was generally counterproductive
349.92 - long options are inherently downside
352.48 - limited already right so managing
355.20 - winners was effective but long premium
357.32 - Traders still need to be patient and
359.64 - willing to accept a lower percentage of
361.08 - winning trades than short premium trades
363.00 - if you remember short premium was like
364.16 - 90 plus per. long was you know 70% but
367.88 - short premium um traders in order for
370.08 - their wins to be big enough to outweigh
372.00 - the losers and um so anyway it's an
375.68 - interesting um it's an interesting study
378.04 - because it shows that either side is if
380.64 - you have the right management mechanics
382.36 - right management techniques um should be
385.80 - uh there's no set it and forget it in
387.48 - the zero day world that's really what it
389.60 - comes down to you can we usually live in
391.64 - a 45 day time frame and you know we
394.24 - always talk about managing a 21 days
396.36 - before exper have that time to I would
398.76 - have taken this to another level and I
400.36 - would have done it based on um the one
402.84 - the vix one day because the only reason
404.80 - I sold premium yesterday and it worked
406.80 - was because the vix one day was at 15
409.04 - today the vix one day just going to look
410.96 - cuz you mentioned it today the vix one
413.00 - day is at 975 down 427 I wouldn't touch
416.88 - it with your money good work good work
