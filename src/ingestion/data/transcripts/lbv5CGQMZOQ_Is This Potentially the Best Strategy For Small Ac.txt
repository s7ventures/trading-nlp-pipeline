0.12 - choosing the long for a poor man's cover
3.00 - call believe it or not we get this
4.88 - question all the time our research team
6.56 - decided to go out and maybe answer this
9.36 - question choosing the long for a poor
11.00 - man's cover call you want to bet want
12.88 - want to make a guess to what Delta that
14.52 - would be Tony I
16.40 - uh I I think he's gonna oh man uh 30-ish
21.04 - Delta is what hits me hits my head I
23.24 - think he's gonna go a little less and
24.60 - I'm going to say 26 you're going to say
26.72 - 26 Deltas yeah no no no for the long
30.00 - strike oh the long strike I'm sorry okay
32.04 - I thought I was look at the short 70
34.04 - Delta would be my default I'm hoping I'm
35.88 - correct let's take a look let's go to
37.64 - the next slide a covered call means
39.80 - selling a short out- of the- money call
41.32 - while holding 100 shares of stock or the
43.16 - underlying whatever it is this strategy
44.96 - generates additional Revenue compared
46.52 - with holding shares under any situation
49.08 - other than a sudden spike in the
50.36 - underlying we're still isn't exposed to
52.36 - a loss so 100 shares can be quite
54.24 - Capital intensive a poor man's covered
56.16 - called pmcc recreates a similar p&l
59.40 - dynamic um by using a in the- money long
62.40 - call in place of shares but how do we
64.88 - decide what long call to use what short
68.44 - call to sell and what kind of difference
71.52 - is so if you buy a stock it's 5050 let's
74.00 - just say if you do a cover call it's
75.48 - probably like 65 35 because you're
78.00 - selling you know you're collecting some
80.16 - premium so you're increasing your
81.40 - probability of profit that's all it is
83.28 - you're capping your upside awesome Yep
85.48 - so that's why people do it it's a very
88.36 - um it it doesn't require any addition
90.20 - Capital gives you a higher probability
91.80 - of success everything's good there's no
93.68 - there's no downside to this um except
96.32 - you cap your upside so let's take a look
98.24 - and see what the team came up with is
100.76 - hey where where do I want to place my
103.28 - long in the money call and you know what
105.96 - should I do with my out of money call
107.36 - let's take a look so we did 15 years of
109.48 - data um spy data and we looked at a
112.72 - variety of covered call um a variety of
115.56 - poor man's covered calls 45 days to
118.04 - expiration um 30 Delta calls that's the
120.88 - all the short options okay so all the
123.92 - long options we're going to use varying
125.92 - but the short options 30 Delta you're
127.80 - good with that I'm good with that I'm
129.28 - good with that yes yeah the 30 Delta is
131.48 - probably where Tony and I would be we
133.32 - sometimes we say 35 sometimes we say 25
135.96 - or 30 but 30 Deltas in the middle yep
138.96 - for the long calls 60 70 80 and 90 Delta
142.36 - strikes with the same expiration and
145.32 - then we looked at 60 days and 120 days
148.36 - or one year to expiration and all the
150.48 - positions were closed when the short
151.68 - option expired so 60 70 80 or 90 you
154.72 - still want to go with 70 I do okay we
157.20 - also included rich man's covered calls
159.36 - that results from using 100 shares a spy
161.28 - in place of the long call at the same
163.68 - time frame just so you could see the
164.80 - difference okay so we called it a rich
166.88 - man's call let's go to the next slide
169.04 - okay so for starters here the first the
172.24 - first one and you can see them here this
174.12 - is the total of everything so 45 days to
177.00 - expiration here's the 60 Delta 70 Delta
179.24 - 80 Delta 90 deltas and then using the
182.00 - underlying stock um and you can see that
187.36 - the bigger the Delta it's a marginal
189.48 - change but obviously if you buy the
191.40 - stock you're going to do a little tiny
192.56 - bit better and if you right where Tony
195.48 - said is right in the middle okay the
197.32 - average p&l virtually the same there's
199.48 - almost no difference across the board
201.12 - and then the average Capital requirement
203.04 - you know why would you use $188,000 when
205.04 - you're making the same amount of money
206.20 - with the same win percentage basically
208.76 - right and Tony said the 70 Delta is
211.44 - probably right where I would be as well
213.84 - because your average p&l is perfect 27
216.68 - and your capital is on the second to
219.08 - lowest number I mean I guess there's
220.96 - there's no wrong answer when it when it
222.44 - works there's no wrong answer no there's
224.68 - never been a wrong answer here it's just
226.52 - it's all about Capital efficiency and
228.24 - getting yourself to a decent number
230.16 - that's all it is the key here was that
231.80 - the rich man's covered call wasn't that
234.72 - much more impressive then so so what we
237.96 - did here is we looked at the long call
240.40 - and again we compare we're just
242.32 - comparing all of these across the board
244.40 - can you go back one slide John yeah this
246.48 - is the 45 days to expiration because I
248.80 - just I I didn't point that out and so
250.92 - the first slide is 45 days to expiration
253.44 - on the second slide it's all the same
255.44 - numbers but we went we did the 60 days
257.88 - to expiration on the long call so we
259.96 - just extended the duration on the long
261.84 - call a little bit to see if the numbers
263.20 - changed and the reality was it was
265.36 - basically all the same so we went and we
267.56 - took it a step further and go to the the
269.88 - next Slide John we went to the sixth
271.96 - month long call now this is when you
274.12 - start to get into what we call leaps the
276.08 - interesting thing here is that the wi
277.88 - percentages basically didn't change at
279.88 - all the average p&l did not change at
282.48 - all the capital requirements went up so
284.40 - the capital requirements were about half
286.60 - if you were at 45 or 60 days than they
289.00 - are if you were at 6 months but none of
291.84 - the other numbers I don't know if this
293.28 - is surprising to you or not none of the
294.76 - other numbers Chang at all yeah I
296.32 - wouldn't think so okay let's go to the
298.44 - next slide so here we went out one year
301.28 - and we wanted to see if the numbers
302.64 - changed and the win percentage did not
305.64 - change at all from one month from one
307.88 - year to 6 months to 60 days to 45 days
312.00 - nothing changes with the win percentages
314.08 - the average p&l surprisingly if you go
316.24 - out one year it doesn't change either
317.80 - not at all what does change oh go what
320.52 - does change is the capital required so
323.36 - again if you went 45 days it only
324.80 - required $800 if you went 60 days it was
327.28 - like $1,000 if you went six months it
329.88 - went up to like 1,500 and now at a year
333.08 - it's 2500 so and this is all using the
336.12 - 70 Delta long call so the difference
338.44 - here is the longer you go out in time
340.48 - the amount of money that you put up
342.32 - that's what changes the capital
343.88 - efficiency of the trade the rich man's
345.88 - number never changes it's just all the
348.12 - people using calls do you know why that
349.92 - is because you're paying more for the
351.72 - call the the actual the actual pricing
354.80 - model the the the buying power
356.52 - requirement model doesn't change one bit
359.28 - the difference is the option that you're
361.44 - buying is way more expensive if you go
363.20 - out a year you're going to pay you know
365.28 - 10 times what you're going to pay for 45
367.12 - days on the long call that's all it is
369.44 - understood there's nothing else to it
370.84 - you're just paying more money for the
371.76 - long call it's not like the the industry
373.84 - is charging you more money let's go to
375.28 - the next slide so some of the takeaways
377.20 - here um writing covered calls and spies
380.28 - generally been a successful strategy
382.00 - over the past decades sure it's
384.04 - basically worked into perpetuity because
385.72 - we've always had positive drift and the
387.00 - market goes higher Poor Man's coverage
388.60 - calls were able to recreate almost all
390.12 - the success of being long stock while
392.68 - requiring vastly less Capital when
394.60 - choosing a long call to form your poor
396.56 - man's covered call it was hard to go
398.52 - wrong but the 70 Delta and the 60 days
401.52 - to expiration provided a nice balance of
404.04 - capital efficiency without giving up
405.56 - profits or reliability compared to the
408.28 - rich man's covered call and then due to
410.16 - the length of the study expect current
413.04 - spy cost to be higher but the relative
415.64 - differences between the strikes and
417.28 - expirations um should remain there's a
420.08 - couple of really good takeaways from
422.24 - this that it it's just it's a wonderful
424.60 - piece the most important thing is if
426.32 - you're looking for what strike to sell
428.48 - it's around 30 Delta if you're looking
430.24 - for what strike to buy you can do the we
433.20 - use the 70 Delta and that made the most
435.24 - sense if you're looking for the perfect
437.88 - duration that is the most reasonable
440.44 - relative to the credit you collect from
442.40 - a capital usage standpoint it's 60 days
445.72 - if you go out to a year there's no
448.00 - difference it just uses more capital all
449.76 - the other numbers stay the same I think
451.60 - this was the first time we've did an
452.96 - in-depth study of the Poor Man's covered
454.52 - call this way and I mean for me
456.60 - personally is very helpful
