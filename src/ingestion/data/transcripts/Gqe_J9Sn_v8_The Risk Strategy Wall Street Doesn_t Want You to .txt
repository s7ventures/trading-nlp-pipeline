0.08 - risk parody portfolio allocation um this
3.64 - we're going back to well I put a lot
5.16 - more way to spoil the party risk I know
7.92 - right R all right I'll go on the
9.72 - internet we got Julia and Jacob back to
11.76 - back today way way to spoil the whole
14.36 - holiday hey I think this is a fun one I
17.00 - put a lot more pictures in this one
18.88 - compared to the one from last week yeah
20.92 - we got pictures this time uh and it's
23.12 - also this is a back of the envelope
24.76 - calculation which I think is kind of fun
26.48 - this is more for an equities portfolio
28.24 - it's a little bit more nuanced uh when
29.72 - you want apply something like this to
31.12 - options uh because you want to keep in
32.68 - mind obviously position size and you
34.32 - would want to me measure risk in a
36.04 - different way so this is kind of the
38.04 - classic one for an equities portfolio
39.64 - but I still think the concept's really
40.96 - interesting so I wanted to talk about it
43.68 - yeah okay let's do let's do it okay so
47.24 - um last week we Dove down this whole
49.24 - rabbit hole in a modern portfolio Theory
51.96 - as an approach to diversifying a
53.16 - portfolio this was the kind of
54.28 - continuation of that uh whole portfolio
56.88 - diversification portfolio allocation
58.92 - sort of series that we're talking
60.00 - talking about and today I wanted to talk
62.24 - about this method which can be used to
64.76 - um determine portfolio weights based on
66.60 - the allocation of risk rather than the
68.60 - allocation of capital which I think is a
70.40 - very interesting
72.00 - concept make sense okie dokie sure easy
75.64 - peasy right like nothing okay A little
78.00 - bit of background okay so portfolio
80.08 - allocation strategy they typically focus
81.92 - on allocations of capital um that are
84.20 - most likely to achieve a certain level
85.84 - of risk a certain level of reward a
87.80 - certain level of diversification so for
89.92 - for this kind of example let's just talk
91.88 - moderate growth equities portfolio 6040
94.48 - this is going to be kind of hybrid 60%
96.36 - stocks and 40% bonds and metals so to
98.64 - keep it simple our portfolio is going to
100.28 - have spy QQQ Apple TLT and gold 20%
103.32 - allocated to each right
107.36 - yeah yeah moderate growth equities
110.24 - portfolio Okay so when we take these
112.84 - five elements with equal Capital
114.56 - allocations to each our capital
116.44 - allocations on this chart are
117.72 - represented in red and you can see
119.04 - they're all even
120.52 - right um when you look at the risk
123.24 - contributions not exactly the same thing
124.96 - as volatility risk contributions a
126.68 - different calculation but when you look
128.20 - at the risk contributions of each of
130.12 - those components from 2015 to 2022 in
132.88 - white you can actually see that spy QQQ
135.76 - and apple have much greater risk
137.68 - contributions um compared to TLT and GLD
140.56 - which is what you would expect right
141.68 - they're much lower volatility assets so
143.12 - if you're allocating kind of 20% of your
144.72 - Capital to each you would kind of expect
146.48 - that Apple would you know as a more
147.84 - volatile asset contribute a lot more
149.92 - risk to this portfolio the total
151.88 - portfolio volatility is 13.7% the the
154.80 - risk contribution of apple is about 5%
157.24 - so a lot of that's coming from Apple and
158.60 - then you got um good amount coming from
160.20 - NASDAQ good amount coming from Spy and
161.60 - then very little coming from TLT and
163.16 - gold which is again expect like right
167.16 - right yes sure right okay so the idea of
169.96 - a risk parody portfolio is that we kind
172.92 - of want all of these components to sort
175.36 - of contribute equal amounts of risk to
177.44 - the portfolio overall and to figure out
179.56 - what weights we would need in order to
182.04 - achieve that and it really focuses on
183.88 - this idea of allocating risk rather than
185.68 - allocating capital and so this is a risk
188.40 - parity portfolio um an example of that
191.12 - and you can see those white bars those
192.52 - risk contributions are a lot more even
194.60 - this you know risk parody portfolio has
196.84 - you know a volatility of about 10% with
199.16 - about 2% coming from each and you can
201.52 - see there's a much greater emphasis on
203.24 - TLT and GLD when you do this risk parity
206.12 - approach and then much less allocated to
207.92 - Apple and the NASDAQ and spy right
211.72 - yes yes yes kind of makes sense yeah so
215.92 - the actual process of calculating the
218.40 - weights for a risk parody portfolio is
220.44 - actually a pretty intense numerical
222.64 - optimization problem that I'm going to
224.56 - dive into more on bad Trader because we
225.88 - got more time there but there's a nice
227.64 - like naive back of the envelope
229.40 - calculation um that I wanted to kind of
231.68 - cover it doesn't get as close to the
235.08 - true risk parody as I'd like but it gets
237.28 - you a little bit closer than the sort of
239.04 - original idea of just equal weight
241.56 - Capital allocation
244.24 - yeah okay so we're going to show some
246.92 - math but it's actually not as bad as it
248.48 - looks we'll go through a numerical
249.92 - example in a second um but when we look
252.40 - at naive risk parity allocation it's
254.32 - sometimes called inverse volatility
255.68 - waiting we the goal really is to give a
258.20 - higher waiting to lower volatility
260.00 - assets and vice versa so the risk
261.64 - contribution is a little bit more even
263.48 - it's a little roughly the same across
265.48 - assets although I'll show the actual
267.12 - results in a second it doesn't get as
268.48 - close as actual risk parity but it's you
270.28 - know for a back of the envelope
271.36 - calculation not that bad this is the
273.32 - equation I'll show again a numerical
275.12 - breakdown in a second but basically to
277.32 - determine the weight for each asset we
279.40 - want we want to take one over the
280.92 - volatility of the asset divided by the
283.00 - sum over one over the volatility of all
285.08 - the Assets in the portfolio that we're
286.32 - looking at um for n Assets in our
288.52 - portfolio is what this equation is kind
290.32 - of looking at does that make
293.24 - sense yeah that's how exactly how we we
296.60 - that's the back of the envelope I mean I
298.08 - don't know the formula but that's the
299.20 - back of the envelope approach we use
300.52 - right now sure yeah it's probably the
301.84 - back of the envelope thing that you do
302.92 - in your head although I will say um for
305.44 - options to be a little bit different CU
307.04 - here I'll show the example we don't we
308.84 - don't we don't do it with options I mean
310.80 - we do it with the underlying right so
313.92 - yeah so this I think has interesting
315.44 - applications and options but again this
317.04 - process is more for an equities
318.32 - portfolio because the way that you
319.36 - measure risk is obviously different with
321.12 - options and this kind of assumes a fully
323.48 - allocated portfolio whereas we want to
325.20 - control our position sizes um when it
327.24 - comes to options so there's more Nuance
328.84 - there uh but the equi scenario is a
330.80 - little bit more interesting and um so
333.76 - here for example we got our let's let's
335.88 - go back you know at our example
337.40 - portfolio spy QQQ Apple TLT and gold
340.16 - 2015 to 2022 we have all of our daily
342.60 - returns right during that period so
344.92 - first things first we're going to
345.80 - calculate our standard deviation of
347.52 - daily returns of that asset for so for
349.28 - spyes about 1.14% makes sense daily
352.00 - returns volatility about 1.14%
353.88 - historically QQ is 1.40 Apple 1.83 Etc
358.24 - um you can also use IV here in place of
360.40 - historical volatility which is actually
362.00 - kind of cool so if you don't want to
363.16 - calculate it yourself you can just pull
364.40 - it from a platform and then plug it into
366.40 - that formula that I showed but first
368.08 - things first we got to measure risk so
370.28 - for equities we would use um kind of
372.52 - returns standard deviation right make
374.44 - sense
375.60 - yeah and then once we have that we would
378.40 - just kind of plug those weights into
379.88 - that equation so for spy for example you
382.40 - would take one over the volatility for
384.08 - Spy 1 over 1.14 and then divide it by
387.52 - one o like the sum of one over all of
389.80 - the volatilities in portfolio so 1 over
392.04 - 1.14 plus 1 over 1.40 for the q's plus 1
396.24 - over 1.83 and so on and then you would
399.36 - get about 20% as your risk parity
401.96 - portfolio approximation waiting for spy
405.80 - yes
408.64 - okay you can use annualized volatility
411.08 - you can use daily volatility it kind of
412.56 - doesn't matter as long as all the
413.64 - volatilities are time scaled the same
415.40 - way so like IV is annualized as long as
417.32 - you use IV for all the assets um or as
420.00 - long as you use daily returns volatility
422.28 - as long as they're all the same um that
424.12 - can kind of work and why can't we just
425.64 - use notional times the volatility you
428.52 - can that that works too yeah okay but if
431.28 - you wanted to apply that to equities we
433.56 - want to be inclusive around here perhaps
435.56 - for all the different types of Traders
436.96 - this is the equity's approach but like
438.32 - you said it's actually very similar to
439.64 - some of the other types of you know
441.24 - strategies that options figes us it's
442.80 - just with different metric so if we now
445.32 - take this and we repeat this for all the
447.04 - different assets in the portfolio it
448.96 - gets us closer to risk parody why don't
451.64 - we do this again this back test from
453.28 - 2015 to 2022 now those white bars those
455.84 - risk contributions are a little bit
457.32 - closer to being even um and we can see
460.16 - that our weights as we would expect give
461.76 - much higher waiting to TLT and GLD with
464.00 - about 25% allocated to each and then
466.52 - closer to 12% allocated to Apple Apple
470.00 - Apple 20% allocated to spy and so on and
472.96 - then yeah those are more even risk
475.20 - contributions uh but it's not as close
478.24 - as even as the actual RIS parity can
480.56 - actually get you um but that being said
482.36 - um it is closer and for a back of the
484.04 - envelope calculation I think it's a
485.64 - pretty it's a pretty simple thing to do
487.60 - and it's pretty easy to understand um
490.24 - and it does get you a little bit closer
491.72 - but again true risk parity which like
493.96 - you probably wouldn't Implement yourself
495.28 - there's online tools that can be used to
497.72 - kind of do this calculation um but the
500.64 - back of the envelope way I think the
502.20 - process is
503.92 - interesting well it clearly looks a lot
506.28 - better than the equal weight yeah yeah
509.32 - right a little bit better um but that
511.76 - being said I think one of the drawbacks
513.24 - of doing this is that it really doesn't
515.32 - take like your expected returns goals
517.48 - into account we're really just trying to
519.04 - sort of yeah equalize sort of risk
521.12 - contributions to a portfolio and with
524.04 - the goal of maybe having a higher sharp
525.56 - ratio of having more stable returns over
527.72 - time um but depending on your goals as
530.36 - an investor um expected returns are
532.52 - obviously something you'd want to keep
533.76 - in mind so I wouldn't I would I don't
535.28 - use any of these diversification or
537.12 - weight techniques in a vacuum um you
539.92 - usually want to use it with a bunch of
541.12 - other stuff especially yeah for options
543.04 - like the way you measure risk is very
544.60 - different right so this isn't quite one
546.12 - to
547.32 - one got it true okay easy peasy
551.80 - interesting good it's a fun one right
554.16 - it's a fun we're going back to form a
555.92 - little bit um yeah and a lot more
557.72 - pictures this time but just to conclude
559.92 - risk parity portfolio allocation focuses
561.84 - on the allocation of risk rather than
563.32 - the allocation of capital with the goal
565.12 - of having each asset contribute roughly
566.76 - the same amount of risk to the portfolio
568.80 - overall and while true risk parity is a
571.04 - pretty complex optimization problem
573.28 - there's a naive approach that can
574.60 - approximate these weights with the back
575.92 - of the envelope calculation that places
578.08 - more emphasis on Lower volatility assets
579.96 - and vice versa and next week on bad
581.56 - Trader because again we have that's a
583.04 - live stream so we can just go into these
585.52 - crazy Dives we're going to go we're
586.96 - going to go into more of the methodology
588.88 - behind true risk parity and talk about
590.76 - our co-variance matrices and such um but
593.60 - this one was a bit of a a lighter
595.64 - version of that so I thought
