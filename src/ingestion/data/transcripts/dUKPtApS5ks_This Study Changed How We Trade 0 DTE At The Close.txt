0.08 - the last 15 minutes of the S&P 500
2.48 - performance I've got some interesting
4.16 - stats on top of all this when we're done
6.72 - with this segment so we got to move
8.08 - quickly let's go first Slide John the
10.56 - zero DT option sellers can benefit from
13.92 - uh benefit if the stock price stays
16.04 - within a specific range by the day's
17.88 - close so we analyze five minute bars
21.32 - this is based on lots of customer
23.84 - requests of near 4,000 trading
27.20 - days for 16 years
31.36 - and we looked at the final 15 minutes
33.72 - from 2:45 to basically 3:00 3:01 central
37.88 - time when when officially the Bell goes
40.48 - off at 301 the key findings the last
44.64 - 15minute range 85% of the time stays
48.48 - within a quarter of a percent 95% of the
52.92 - time stays within a half a percent and
57.08 - these are just you know these are kind
58.80 - of pretty straightforward statistics and
61.56 - 98.66% of the time stays within 34 of a
66.68 - percent okay now percent movees big yeah
70.40 - yeah especially in like the spy and the
72.00 - SPX so if you go onto the trading
73.52 - platform you'll see like a one to two
75.52 - standard deviation move is around 0.7 so
77.80 - we're just saying that everything
78.72 - clusters around that and the reason we
80.72 - use spy instead of SPX in the study is
82.92 - it's just easier to get spy data for us
84.84 - than SPX because you're dealing with
86.08 - smaller numbers so yeah that's the only
88.04 - thing to point out here you can multiply
89.68 - it by you can multiply it by 10 if you
91.84 - want the SPX yeah so this is the F the
94.40 - first chart is a normal distribution
96.28 - chart shows the range is currently tight
99.12 - 85% of the time it's around a quarter of
103.60 - um a quarter of a percent now just to
105.04 - put a quarter of a percent in
106.64 - perspective um a quarter of a percent is
110.12 - about 15 handles right so just to put
112.84 - some context it's around 15 Handles in
114.72 - the snps like this morning the S&P have
117.40 - moved half a percent that's the whole
119.36 - overnight that is correct we're talking
121.80 - about the last 15 minutes it's about 15
123.80 - handles now the way the markets are
125.56 - priced like yesterday I sold some calls
128.64 - that were 10 handles above so like you
132.00 - don't get a lot of premium for 15
133.88 - handles away I'm just telling you right
135.32 - now so it's not like there's a lot of
137.36 - juice there sure let's go next slide
139.32 - when you like talk about percentages uh
141.88 - it can get a little skewed the data but
144.00 - yeah yeah when you talk about
145.68 - percentages it sounds like oh I'm gonna
147.40 - collect a lot of money for this no no no
150.04 - if you go out to 15 you're going to
151.76 - collect about 30 cents and about 15
153.72 - handles away with 15 minutes to go you
155.72 - know 30 to 40 cents tops if you're going
158.28 - to go inside of that you're going to get
159.52 - maybe a buck so each each TW each
163.16 - quarter of a percent brings you in like
165.88 - another you know goes like goes like
167.88 - 3040 cents a dollar and then it goes
169.96 - like 250 so
172.52 - so believe me they have this down to a
175.72 - science for the last 15 minutes of the
178.56 - Spy um this is interesting so I'm not so
183.12 - sure that you would have guessed this
184.64 - Tony because I for sure thought it was
186.36 - the other way
187.44 - around agreed 48% of the time 48.3 we go
192.60 - higher in the last 15 minutes and 50.2
195.52 - we go lower seems like higher 100% of
198.00 - the time is what I would have said
199.40 - doesn't it yeah yeah I mean because I'm
201.72 - living it it depends on the years that
203.16 - you use actually before 2020 I think it
205.24 - was slightly like uh higher uh but now
208.36 - obviously because of we including 2020
210.68 - data and 2022 data into here it's uh it
212.92 - is actually uh closes a lot lower and
215.44 - the interesting part about here is that
216.72 - 1.5% of the time it was actually the
218.84 - same there was no change at all and I
220.80 - thought that number would be a lot lower
223.12 - because I thought there was always going
224.04 - to be change the last 15 minutes in the
225.64 - market so
227.08 - yeah I I'm actually in shock that over
230.24 - the last 16 years the last 15 minutes of
232.72 - the day has more lower days than higher
235.32 - days I'm surprised yeah it's very
237.12 - interesting so 4,000 days of 5 bars
240.20 - during the last 15 minutes shows that 95
243.44 - 5% of the time the Spy the last 15
246.32 - minutes Falls within a half a percent
248.12 - range now again half percent range is 30
250.64 - handles so that's big and there's not
254.40 - much juice in that but that's 95% yeah
256.88 - for this graph too especially you can
258.96 - see that the volatility increases so all
261.16 - of our tasty mechanics hold true even
263.12 - when you're talking about the last 15
264.28 - minutes uh of the trading day where the
266.60 - volatility increases towards the end of
268.24 - the trade just like in a normal 45 DT
270.60 - cycle where the volatility increases and
273.36 - like so you can even think about even
275.16 - though you would not do it uh too much
276.68 - over you can even think about managing
278.80 - just before closing and everything like
280.32 - that just to exit out of the volatility
281.88 - so on this slide we we we we basically
284.88 - take it up a notch so you can see here
287.68 - let's just see the calculation so what
289.68 - am I looking at here so this we just
291.76 - took a day like uh one of the days in
294.24 - January so yeah January 17 just to uh
297.20 - explain this point a little bit further
299.08 - the calcul is uh just math don't get too
302.68 - scared about it that 0.9975 and
305.76 - 1.25 number that we're multiplying by is
308.12 - just the to get the one standard
309.48 - deviation theoretical move so we're
311.24 - saying theoretically 85% of the time the
313.72 - one standard deviation which is plus or
315.12 - minus 0.25% it should be between 596 or
318.60 - 599 and we showed that on this specific
321.00 - day it was 597 which is a minus. 12%
324.48 - move so on this specific day it happened
326.28 - and on most of the days it'll happen
327.64 - like this so if you just pick any random
329.24 - day this is like an interesting chart
331.56 - that you can generate if you go through
333.12 - all the numbers that's really good I
335.80 - like that and this is that same
337.84 - information in table form so like your
340.52 - minimum and your maximum numbers are
342.80 - this is including all of the all of the
344.64 - data so obviously Min - 2 and 3% those
347.44 - two dates were from 2020 when you had
349.60 - the most uh volatility so uh and then
352.52 - your standard deviation your curtosis
354.48 - this is very interesting the curtosis is
356.84 - 41 and if you if you remember any of our
359.32 - studies that have talked about cytosis
361.36 - uh that means that it's uh the number is
363.28 - greater than three that means that the
365.36 - taals are going to be really really uh
367.52 - fat and what that basically means is
369.44 - you're going to have a lot of outlier
370.68 - moves obviously in the SPX throughout 16
372.88 - years of study it has had a lot of
374.60 - outlier moves so all of our stuff that
377.28 - we've talked about math stuff comes back
379.24 - into the study in this table yeah that's
381.16 - really good I like
383.08 - it like you were talking about yeah
385.64 - there's a lot of information here this
386.88 - is great so 2020 had the highest number
390.00 - of three standard deviation day outli
393.08 - three standard deviation outlier moves
396.00 - and since 2009 the medium count of
398.60 - outlier moves is five per year God that
402.20 - sounds like a lot to me yeah so this
404.32 - graph very important we're not dealing
406.16 - with percentages on this graph we're
407.60 - dealing with actual numbers counts
410.12 - because obviously the amount of times
411.28 - that you're going to be moving three
412.56 - standard deviation is very small and
414.36 - yeah 2020 had the most and un
416.88 - unfortunately we don't have 2008 data
418.40 - over here i' imagine that would also
419.68 - fairly High uh and then yeah the rest of
421.84 - the years are all grafted out too and
423.28 - some of the years you don't get any so
425.72 - well three standard deviation is a lot
427.20 - but um I'm still surprised five for a
429.44 - year that seems like crazy okay now I
431.56 - liveed that too and I would have said it
432.92 - was less yeah you Tred to take out all
435.96 - the bad information from your head yeah
437.64 - you're right you're right yeah you kind
439.48 - of for I would have said I would have
441.60 - said a th% it was less I feel like if we
444.64 - went back to your 2020 broadcast we
446.44 - would hear you guys talking about it
448.48 - every single day how it's moving so much
449.88 - but I'm bad with dates anyway I try to
451.32 - forget about everything but that's but
452.96 - that's why 2020 just skews this thing
454.92 - off well whatever that's that's all so
457.64 - yeah this is just going by the months
459.48 - yeah so this is outlier moves they
461.36 - happen most frequently in March and
463.16 - least frequently in uh July January and
465.16 - December so this is just going through
466.44 - months if you wanted to know that
468.08 - information this data is also a little
469.84 - slightly skewed because obviously March
471.56 - has more trading volume than something
473.12 - like January months that have more
474.72 - trading volume will also have more
476.24 - outlier moves than less but yeah it's
478.72 - interesting to note that right now uh in
480.64 - the January and December period uh do we
483.36 - should not expect too many Aller moves
484.76 - and then as we're heading into February
486.04 - and March we should expect more I think
488.16 - that historically we've had some of the
489.64 - biggest moves ever in March you know
492.48 - whether it's 2000 whether it's
495.12 - 2009 whe you know basically whether it
497.92 - was 2020 March has been you know March
501.16 - is the month no doubt about it I don't
502.84 - think they're going to wait till March
503.88 - this year Tuesday has the smallest mean
507.00 - and median percent move for the Spy the
508.96 - last 15 minutes that's crazy how's that
511.92 - possible you're learning a lot today s
514.16 - so this is just going by the days now so
516.08 - we're just going through all the
517.12 - different data points Monday and Friday
519.32 - uh so you would think from the last
520.64 - slide that Monday and Friday uh are you
522.56 - know they have the most trading Fridays
524.48 - the expiration dates uh they would have
526.60 - the most outlier moves but it's actually
528.16 - just Tuesday and it's uh the blue and
530.44 - the green is just highlighting the mean
531.96 - and the median how much the mean you
534.04 - know excuse the data and why we tend why
536.16 - we use median a lot of the times as well
537.68 - cu the bars between mean and median are
540.60 - uh they have a lot of difference to them
542.44 - but yeah just
543.76 - Tuesday you would never think that I
546.24 - would never never never in a million
548.40 - years let's go to next slide and you
550.32 - tell me this today I missed it now
551.80 - yesterday oh I
553.28 - yes yeah you're all by I have to wait a
555.52 - whole week now we're off by day because
558.00 - of Monday okay that's right that's right
560.72 - takeaways tight trading range spy tends
563.20 - to trade within a smaller range during
564.60 - the last 15 minutes of the trading day
566.56 - Tuesday has the smallest Range on
568.28 - average all right bet Tuesdays we sell
570.64 - on Tuesdays Tuesday we let them have it
572.64 - sell that's right give them with both
574.76 - hands outlier moves are rare and large
578.32 - so three standard deviation moves are
580.68 - very rare um upside outliers are more
584.52 - painful than downside outliers and March
587.20 - has the most outliers huh and then high
590.92 - probability range targets betting that
592.84 - the Spy trades within plus or minus a
595.56 - half a percent of its 245 price was
598.24 - successful 95% the time there's not much
601.56 - juice in that but non-directional
602.88 - defined risk sellers can thrive in that
606.56 - time period mhm yeah and just remember
609.44 - like Tom was mentioning with all this
610.92 - stuff when you hear like 0.5% 0.72% when
614.20 - you're talking about something like spy
615.72 - or even the SPX like a 1% move in the
618.00 - SPX is 60 bucks right now so you are
620.24 - dealing with large dollar moves uh even
622.80 - if the percentages are small over here
624.32 - so yeah you're not gonna get a lot in
626.92 - the Spy I mean you're really gonna have
628.40 - to do you know
630.00 - SPX because the Spy the problem is you
632.68 - have too much uh assignment risk if
635.80 - something moves after hours it's got to
637.20 - be SPX
