0.20 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.36 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
3.92 - you today January 21st
7.84 - 2025 but first as we always do let's
10.52 - take a quick look at the market even &ps
13.40 - up 32 handles that's about where they
16.00 - were from most of the night 25 to up 30
19.04 - when we came on the show earlier this
20.96 - morning but you can see here they've had
22.60 - a big range of almost 80 plus points on
26.20 - the Emin snps up to around 78 just a few
30.28 - from where we are right now all the way
31.80 - down to under 6,000 NASDAQ doing the
34.68 - same with a big range up 46 Russell up
37.96 - 37 and the Dow up
40.20 - 443 volatility in by 66 cents you can
43.80 - see here trading near the lows this is
46.08 - what I look at SL VX that's the
49.08 - volatility Futures I think it's the best
51.60 - indicator for daily movement and
53.60 - volatility better than VI and better
55.84 - than anything else that's what I watch
58.16 - the vix Futures the vix Futures remain
61.16 - weak we typically get an extended move
63.88 - to the upside if volatility Futures seem
67.20 - to Rally or hold a little bit the up
69.88 - move seems to wne off and maybe you get
72.20 - a down move bonds up 23 ticks Bitcoin
76.28 - had a big range last night from under
78.88 - 100,000 to over 110,000 it sits
82.12 - mid-range at 106 and now I bring you to
85.16 - the product I'm going to trade that's
87.60 - right the world's worst commodity Trader
90.12 - is going into oil oil traded down to 75
93.72 - and change up to almost 78 it's sitting
97.40 - at mid range uh down a dollar and change
100.72 - at
102.92 - 7621 Ivy rank is pretty good at 28 and
106.48 - change it's been up ticking as you can
109.32 - see here down on the bottom it's at the
112.16 - higher end of its range so I am going to
114.44 - use an omnidirectional trade here to do
117.00 - something in oil you may ask why are you
118.76 - going into oil well when I take a look
120.80 - at my watch list here and I have the
122.40 - high option volume list and I've taken
124.36 - away all of the earnings just by
126.08 - clicking this button here I click all
128.80 - the earnings I put them in order you'll
130.64 - notice that there's not a lot of stocks
132.84 - with the ivx 5day change expanding and
137.24 - or IV rank very high matter of fact all
140.64 - of these stocks here are very difficult
143.40 - uh to trade especially with the low
145.96 - implied volatility that they have here
148.48 - so I am going into to CCL now I am the
152.24 - world's worst commodity Trader so take
154.72 - that with a grain of salt now I did do
157.00 - this trade when oil was down around
159.60 - 90ish cents so it may have moved a penny
162.56 - or two which is actually a decent size
165.88 - move on the option sides because these
168.72 - options are now $10 not one penny I'll
173.32 - explain that to you right now in a
174.84 - moment what options am I looking to use
177.16 - well I'm looking to use uh the March
179.56 - option options here now you U may need
182.96 - to decide what month you're going to go
185.44 - to I'll make it pretty easy for you if
188.28 - you look here on the Futures they're
189.96 - trading
191.44 - 7617 but as you go down a little bit
194.04 - further you'll see that these February
195.88 - options are really tied to a different
199.12 - month future on the tasty trade platform
202.32 - it's very easy for you because each one
204.80 - of the the options that are traded the
207.80 - clear it's clearly represented by the
210.04 - future that those options are
212.08 - represented so there's a little bit
213.76 - they're trading 76 and change the next
216.44 - month is trading 75 and change I'm going
218.88 - to go to these March options with 55
221.52 - days to go you say why not go to the
224.44 - options with 34 days to go and I said I
226.48 - would make it easy for you and I'll show
227.96 - you why I'm going to open up those
229.88 - options and you'll notice that there's
231.92 - no volume in these options the markets
234.96 - are also five or six cents wide which is
238.12 - 50 or 60
240.24 - doll wide not five or six cents wide
244.00 - I'll explain that to you in a moment
245.40 - when I when I get to the next page let's
247.76 - close that up and go to the um March
251.32 - options with the at the money being
253.52 - around $75 the March options you'll
256.76 - notice are very liquid good markets
260.36 - closer to two or three cents wide and
263.48 - plenty of volume on each side of the
266.72 - market so now that we know where we want
268.76 - to go we know what what the price of the
271.80 - O of the oil this is barrels of oil are
275.52 - trading 75 and change this line right
278.60 - here in the m is the at the money line
281.80 - so you'll notice that corresponds right
283.44 - to the Futures it's in between 75 and 75
287.04 - and a half I'm going to do a one by two
290.60 - ratio spread now you can do this trade
292.60 - in an IRA account to it's just going to
295.00 - take double the amount of buying power
298.12 - now just to prove a point here I'm going
300.60 - to show that you this option at a
303.32 - dollar it's actually
306.88 - ,000 $1 no it's moving sorry $1 in an
311.56 - option is
313.04 - ,000 in premium I know if you're on the
315.92 - equity side you're used to a dollar
318.32 - being a $100 well oil future options are
322.00 - 10 times the size so this is a very
324.92 - large trade even when you're making it
327.60 - small let me show you what I'm looking
329.36 - to here just like any other type of
332.00 - ratio spread I like to buy the strike
335.00 - that has a probability of at least being
337.48 - in the money so what am I doing here I'm
339.80 - going to go to somewhere around the
341.40 - 20ish option why let me explain I'm
344.36 - going to get rid of volume here for a
345.88 - moment and go to probability of a touch
349.08 - when you go to probability of a touch
350.68 - here you'll notice that these 20ish
352.68 - Delta options are around a 5050 chance
356.08 - of touching this number now I'm going to
359.28 - choose the 83 strike because I'm the
361.68 - world's worst commodity Trader and I
363.92 - don't want it to touch here even though
366.08 - 83 or above might be a better price at
370.80 - expiration for me I just want oil to go
374.32 - lower this is an omnidirectional
376.72 - slightly bearish trade in oil I'm going
379.52 - to buy the 83 call one time and I'm
383.16 - going to sell two of the 86 calls one by
387.96 - two I did this trade for a 32 Cent
391.20 - credit it's right there right now it's
393.36 - mid price when I place this trade I did
396.24 - have to get filled one tick under uh 32
400.32 - or one tick under the mid price my mid
403.32 - price was 33 the mid price is 32 I would
407.12 - leave it in there oil's been moving
408.80 - around maybe you'll get filled at 32
411.28 - also 32 is not
413.80 - 32 it's
417.12 - $320 in credit for the that almost
421.40 - $4,100 in buying power that you're using
425.28 - that's why you'll notice here your max
427.56 - profit is
431.20 - $3,320 because everything is 10 times
435.40 - what you're used to I'm long one of the
438.08 - 83 calls I'm short one of the 86 calls I
442.44 - know it says two just bear with me for a
444.36 - moment but if oil were to close at
446.80 - expiration at 86 I belong the 83 calls
450.84 - that would be worth $3 which is
453.96 - $3,000 plus the credit I received which
456.40 - is 32
460.56 - $3,320 is your max profit on that $4,000
465.20 - worth of buying power now if you were in
467.20 - an IRA account that buying power would
469.12 - be closer to $88,500 or
472.32 - $8,700 in buying power and please
475.36 - remember this buying power is subject to
478.28 - change remember this is not Equity
481.36 - options these are Futures options and
484.40 - they march by a different beat of the
486.96 - drum as you get closer to expiration and
490.92 - your options are closer to at the money
493.92 - this buying power will increase a a
497.24 - matter of fact will increase maybe
499.76 - sometimes as much as two times as much
502.60 - buying power so please if you make a
505.04 - trade like this realize that this buying
507.64 - power is going to change and want to
509.96 - have a lot of buying power on the
512.08 - sidelines your Theta Decay is $115 a day
516.52 - and this has an
518.16 - 89% pop high probability trade with a
521.72 - break even above 89 that's right your
526.16 - break even is 89 and change which only
528.96 - has about a 10% pop and about a 20%
532.64 - chance of a touch just rounding on both
535.80 - of those again
538.08 - $320 what's your reasonable expectation
541.64 - to look for risk and reward well for me
544.84 - I stick to the same dollar or two profit
547.96 - which means if I could buy this back at
550.24 - 22 or 12 I would make myself $200 and
554.76 - $100 respectfully remember your max
558.32 - profit
559.24 - $3,300 for that $4,000 of buying power
562.88 - to initiate this trade no risk to the
566.20 - downside that's why this green line goes
569.40 - all the way down to the bottom so if you
571.60 - don't think that oil is going to make
573.56 - new highs well this might be a trade for
576.80 - you but something I know you want to do
578.84 - regardless of your opinion on oil is
