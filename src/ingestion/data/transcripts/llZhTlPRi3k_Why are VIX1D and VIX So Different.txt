0.08 - I noticed early in the day that the vix
1.64 - was higher but the vix one day was lower
3.84 - how can that be one day implied
6.24 - volatility versus the monthly implied
9.20 - volatility with the vix is looking out
10.88 - 30 days and the one day only cares about
13.44 - here and now the next couple hours they
15.28 - really are very independent of one
17.00 - another on many days you'll find the vix
18.96 - one day significantly lower if nothing's
21.52 - going on
