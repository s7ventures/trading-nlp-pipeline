0.04 - today I wanted to talk about stock price
1.76 - simulations let's do it let's go girl
4.44 - yeah you want to get into it hell yeah
6.00 - okay so last week which Tom so rudely
9.08 - missed we talk about some historical uh
11.76 - popular metrics um and the pros and cons
14.00 - of each we talked about historical
15.24 - volatility beta and siar and today I
17.24 - wanted to look more about
18.08 - forward-looking risk metrics
19.76 - specifically ones from simulated stock
21.44 - prices um and kind of wanted to talk
23.36 - about the actual process of simulating a
25.60 - stock price because it's actually kind
28.04 - of cool and we use it all time and I
30.56 - think understanding where it comes from
31.84 - helps us understand the pitfalls a
33.28 - little bit more kind of neat let's go I
36.48 - want to see this hell yeah okay so um
39.72 - this was kind of an outline of some of
41.24 - the stuff that uh was part of this big
43.00 - risk um I don't know what you want to
44.84 - call it like Workshop that we kind of
46.08 - did and this is the simulated uh data
49.04 - part of it and of course that comes from
50.76 - of course that comes from geometric
52.12 - brownan Mo motion we all great things
54.24 - start do we remember our geometric
56.12 - brownan motion of course love a little
58.60 - geometric brownan motion we love a
60.72 - little geometric browny motion um we
62.88 - talk about this I think like a decent
65.12 - amount which is kind of cool you're
66.16 - going to sound super cool at parties now
67.72 - talking about your geometric brownan
69.20 - motion um assuming constant drift and
71.72 - volatility um there's some assumptions
74.20 - that come when we assert that this is
76.20 - what a stock price follows such as that
78.16 - stock prices are a continuous process
80.00 - they have normally distributed log
81.28 - returns they have constant drif in
82.32 - volatility and I'll get to it in a
84.72 - second but wanted to point out the cool
86.48 - graphic because what we have here that
88.72 - first little chart on the left we have
89.96 - have a particle actually undergoing
91.72 - Brownian motion in a fluid and what you
94.04 - actually look like is the horizontal
96.28 - displacement of that particle over time
98.16 - well you actually see something that
99.24 - kind of looks like a stock price Isn't
100.48 - that cool cool beans so we got our
102.60 - particle undergoing geometric Browning
104.24 - motion but we you know this assert that
106.36 - a stock price has certain
107.44 - characteristics have constant drift and
109.16 - volatility and okay we're going to show
111.04 - some math but it has dynamics that can
114.00 - be described by the following stochastic
116.12 - differential equation this is basically
118.32 - I'm not going to get into the math of
119.44 - where this comes from but if we kind of
121.60 - Wiggle our stock price a little bit what
123.64 - is the expected result and this is
126.16 - what's mathematically consistent with
127.68 - that um so we have this kind of change
129.96 - in stock price is equal to a couple
132.04 - different um aspects of the stock so you
134.20 - have your expected returns your standard
136.12 - deviation of returns the current
137.88 - location of the stock price as well as
140.04 - this change in geometric Brown and
141.40 - motion the actual like equation doesn't
144.64 - quite matter as much what's more
145.96 - interesting is what approximation we can
148.12 - use to solve this equation
150.64 - um there's a discrete time approximation
152.80 - for that given below and I'll give a
154.88 - translation of what that this means in
156.88 - in a minute but what I wanted to get
159.12 - away from this slide is that we can
160.96 - actually according to this model
162.68 - actually model changes in stock price
164.40 - projected stock prices using two
166.40 - components component one is called a
168.48 - deterministic component this is just
170.08 - made of the expected returns of the
171.68 - stock the standard deviation of returns
173.20 - of the stock it's called a deterministic
175.00 - component which means it's actually
176.52 - predictable right it's not random and
178.76 - then we simulate Market Randomness with
181.08 - this stochastic component and I'll get
182.88 - into that in a second but what we can
184.68 - kind of infer from this is that stock
186.68 - prices change with something that's
188.32 - predictable like it's not you know
189.76 - totally crazy it's not completely random
191.80 - but we add this little market Randomness
193.48 - to it um which I think is kind of cool
195.44 - is that kind of make sense so far I mean
197.00 - the formulas are too hard but everything
198.72 - else makes sense all that we need to
201.08 - like take away from this I think is that
202.80 - if we want to model stock prices there's
204.32 - a predictable part and then there's a
205.80 - random part that's at least how this
207.24 - model kind of uh kind of puts that
209.60 - together does that kind of make sense
210.80 - yeah that makes sense it's like you know
212.56 - a stock price can only change so much
214.08 - from its previous stock price day to day
216.04 - this is kind of saying that that when we
217.56 - look at that change it's not like
218.80 - completely random there's like a
220.16 - deterministic component a predictable
221.80 - component and then an unpredictable
223.92 - wiggle I guess what you can call it can
226.40 - of make sense yeah sure and we're saying
229.96 - in this that this random component the
232.12 - stochastic component is driven by a
234.28 - standard normal random variable ZT which
236.36 - you guys already know because that's
237.84 - just a normal distribution with me of
240.08 - zero and variance of one so effectively
242.76 - what the stochastic component is doing
244.56 - to simulate Randomness is in this
246.92 - calculation we're taking this stuff from
248.92 - you know calculated from the historical
250.56 - performance of the stock and then we're
252.32 - just kind of randomly you know grabbing
254.56 - a value from a distribution and that's
256.56 - how we simulate our Market Randomness as
258.40 - a stock price evolves in
261.08 - time that kind of make sense sure yeah
264.52 - that's kind of how we we also back into
267.00 - expected
268.52 - move um well I mean it it's all kind of
271.40 - driven from the same sort of assumption
273.60 - which is like this normal distribution
275.12 - assumption right so we're saying that
277.04 - like if a stock price is randomly
278.52 - evolving in time it's not like you know
280.12 - completely random there's a
281.08 - deterministic part of it but if we want
282.76 - to simulate Randomness I'll actually
284.24 - show a numeric example in a minute which
286.16 - might give some intuition but in order
288.08 - to kind of simulate this random process
289.72 - we're literally just pulling random
291.44 - values from a specific type of
293.12 - distribution that's consistent with the
294.68 - black schs form formalism this geometric
297.12 - brandan motion kind of yeah
300.68 - got it sure right well so the
302.88 - translation of that is that each time
305.40 - you know a stock price evolves like I
307.24 - said there's this kind of deterministic
309.60 - component that's calculated from the
311.72 - expected daily returns of the stock um
314.24 - the standard deviation of returns of the
315.76 - stock and then this sort of yeah random
317.64 - component which is driven by this uh you
320.68 - know or that's pulled rather from this
322.56 - distribution that's again consistent
324.12 - with the black shs formalism that's what
326.16 - I'm kind of trying to show here yeah
328.76 - yeah that we understand yeah okay let's
331.08 - look at a numerical example because we
333.12 - we like numbers around here so if we
334.72 - have a stock it's trading at $100
336.88 - annualized expected return of 5%
338.96 - standard annualized uh volatility of 20%
341.60 - we can understand that right yes okay so
344.40 - if we want to simulate this right snot's
346.68 - going to be $100 that's where it's
347.92 - starting from mu right and is going to
350.24 - be that expected returns it's going to
351.84 - be five or0 5% that Sigma term is going
355.04 - to be 0.2 and then if we try to simulate
358.08 - daily stock price movements um again
360.80 - this is kind of coming from the
361.64 - formalism what we need to know is that
363.04 - delta T term in this equation is 1 over
365.16 - 252 it's uh how we're just going to you
367.44 - know time step each day basically again
370.04 - just we're just taking these values and
371.40 - plugging them into this equation kind of
373.00 - make sense so far so far so far right
376.68 - the numerics hopefully make it a bit
378.32 - easier um so we're going to take all
380.68 - those values we're going to plug it into
382.28 - this formula and then for each um each
386.00 - time step we're going to pull from this
387.92 - random distribution that's going to be
389.76 - represented here with ZT so each time
392.00 - we're going to pull from this Rand we're
393.16 - just going to plug it into the equation
394.84 - and that's actually going to evolve
396.92 - randomly in the simulation the stock
399.24 - price in time
402.04 - yeah yeah so what are you saying here
407.32 - the um what I can't read what the move
410.92 - so those are the prices so these are the
414.04 - values that we're plugging into that
415.56 - equation I got that and each yeah and
418.04 - the prices on the end are the are the
420.52 - expected move the prices are the actual
423.80 - movements of the stock price if we want
425.48 - to calculate like an expected move cone
428.32 - like if we evolve this over time then we
430.88 - can actually simulate over time the you
433.12 - know the the simulated stock price and
436.64 - then from this simulation we can
438.92 - calculate certain statistics kind of
441.56 - make sense yeah kind of I mean kind of
446.56 - yeah kind of well this well hopefully a
449.68 - little bit I'm kind of it's um there's
452.04 - some stuff in here but it's the the
454.24 - backend process of some of these
455.68 - statistics because well so if we do this
457.88 - once if we simulate this over a year now
459.92 - we have one year's worth of data right
462.44 - and then we can repeat this a couple of
464.40 - different times now we have a Monte
466.36 - Carlo right this is how we do a Monte
468.20 - Carlo we repeat this a couple of
469.84 - different times we project stock prices
471.36 - over a year and now we have a
473.80 - distribution of different possible
475.96 - outcomes and we can measure those
477.60 - statistics we can look at things like
479.12 - pop for example we can look at things
480.80 - like sear for example we can look at
483.04 - other historical risk measures using
485.28 - this you know spread of possible
487.80 - outcomes you can do this with portfolios
490.32 - you can do this with simulations of
491.64 - individual stocks you can do this with
493.48 - you can plug options in here you can
495.04 - plug a bunch of different lugs in here
496.36 - and then look at different distributions
498.24 - it's actually kind of
500.24 - cool I
503.48 - think yes uh
507.92 - cool very cool
510.00 - it's a good way to get to the Monte
511.60 - Carlo simulation for sure well we gota
514.60 - we gota to do a Monte Carlo we got to
516.60 - know how to get there and I think the
519.16 - well the real reason the real reason I
521.56 - think the most useful reason about
523.36 - understanding how this is done is then
525.64 - understanding what the limitations are
528.24 - um because like right we assumed this
531.04 - all came from the black schs model and
532.64 - if you remember those assumptions we
533.88 - assumed that stock prices are continuous
536.20 - um which like you know with the earnings
537.88 - when you have these really big disc
539.52 - continuous jumps we know okay so there
541.20 - might be a limitation there if we use
543.04 - simulations to then you know use that
545.64 - for a stock that might be having
546.88 - earnings that are coming up right um
548.64 - they have normally distributed log
550.00 - returns so if for you know like heavily
551.60 - skewed distributions we might run into
553.52 - problems they have constant drift and
554.92 - volatility we know that volatility
556.64 - changes all the time um so that kind of
559.52 - means that you know we want to take some
561.08 - of these simulation results like pop
562.76 - like C or that kind of stuff with a
564.08 - grain of salt um but what this also
566.68 - tells us is that we can maybe account
568.16 - for some of these other factors with
569.48 - more complex price models because a lot
571.20 - of these limitations are fundamentally
572.72 - rooted in how we simulate a stock price
575.44 - that was nice and
577.72 - light it was a it was a fun little fun
580.40 - little stock price simulation think
582.80 - that's kind of cool it was I wasn't I
584.48 - didn't think that's where you're going
585.48 - with simulation but that's good I didn't
587.36 - know that's how well that's how you do
588.80 - with Monte Carlo I know maybe I should
590.92 - start with the punchline next time how
592.52 - about that now I know now I know how you
595.08 - get to a Monte Carlo got it it's one of
597.32 - many ways to do a Monte Carlo um it's a
599.68 - pretty cool um way to do it um like I
601.80 - said we do a lot of platforms this is
603.48 - how you know like if you don't have
604.72 - historical data to use for your you know
606.64 - option back testing that kind of stuff
609.32 - um then simulations are actually a
610.88 - pretty cool way to actually look at
612.48 - different outcomes probabilistically
614.00 - over time and um this is something that
616.72 - you can actually do with a spreadsheet
618.32 - maybe we'll talk about that next week
619.84 - actually that was one of the first uh
621.56 - like one of the segments we did a couple
623.04 - weeks back was showing a spreadsheet
624.60 - that kind of did all these simulations
626.40 - which is a really good example like in a
628.56 - in a you know Google sheet this is a
630.12 - very good example of a tool that can
631.44 - technically do something that isn't at
632.92 - all built for it but um if you
635.52 - understand the process if you have this
636.92 - model for Randomness if you have like a
638.96 - model for stock price and MX then you
640.60 - can actually kind of do it yourself as
642.08 - well which is kind of cool
