0.12 - presidential terms and Market volatility
2.56 - let's take a look at where the team went
3.84 - with this our last election piece we
6.40 - looked at 2016 to 2020 and 2020 to 2024
11.20 - we looked at spy short strangles because
14.32 - we're looking for stuff to do today we
16.12 - looked at the success rate the premium
17.68 - collected everything else we compared
19.08 - the results across the last two
21.12 - presidential terms the four years of
23.32 - trump and the four years of Biden we use
25.20 - the implied volatility rank to gauge
26.80 - option prices it
28.96 - reports expensive options near a 35%
32.00 - reading when IV is near its highest
34.04 - level of the year in this study we aim
36.08 - to explore how varying volatility levels
37.96 - have influenced market conditions across
40.84 - past presidential terms
43.92 - interesting this table shows the
45.96 - frequency of each volatility level now
49.00 - again we're looking at uh one year 23 to
52.52 - 24 then 2016 to 2020 and 20 to 24 so I'm
56.64 - covering all the bases here and the
58.96 - amount of the percentage of time that
60.68 - vix was in you know different ranges in
63.68 - the Trump Administration the first one
65.12 - it was weird we got down to a seven we
67.28 - got down 7% of the time that vix was
69.04 - under 10 never happened under Biden
72.00 - never happened the last year of course
74.28 - um and the funny thing is that when you
77.96 - look at the rest of the numbers they're
80.40 - not they're not that crazy volatility
83.20 - has been a little bit higher since the
85.40 - pandemic um you know a lot of people
87.52 - think that under Trump we had these
89.64 - crazy czy volatile times and all this
91.20 - other stuff but the reality is we didn't
93.60 - really no was business as usual just
95.44 - like every other president right most of
97.20 - the time 63% of the time volatility was
100.52 - in the crapper you know it only rallied
102.20 - a couple times under Trump 2020 we did
104.64 - have the pandemic built into there so
106.96 - when you look at 2023 to 2024 87% of the
110.92 - time we did nothing was kind of a very
113.56 - weird slow you know slow time and then
116.36 - in 2020 to 2024 you know the whole
118.56 - picture it kind of broadened out things
120.36 - a little bit more and um you can see
122.80 - over the last eight years we have not
124.72 - had you know 1% of the time or sorry
128.16 - 1.8% of the time total in the last eight
131.80 - years the volatility has been over 40
133.72 - and only 133% of the time it's been over
135.44 - 30 you know this is where we live most
137.64 - of the time in recent years implied
140.24 - volatility of the S&P 500 has ranged
142.24 - between 10 and 30 that's very fair this
144.92 - period has been marked by relatively low
146.96 - volatility which suggests that selling
148.44 - options when the ivy rank is low may not
150.72 - be ideal waiting for High V rank over 30
153.76 - to initiate trades Also may not be
155.92 - practical as we've observed IV can
157.80 - decline remain low for extended periods
159.80 - given this should we consider a more
161.56 - aggressive approach so this shows the
163.72 - results across different ivr
165.20 - environments for four years from 16 to
167.84 - 20 and we focus on the 0 to 30 range as
170.28 - it appeared more frequently in recent
171.84 - years and it serves as a useful
173.68 - comparison so the success rates don't
177.00 - really change that much between 10 and
179.92 - 20 20 and 30 the average p&l obviously
184.28 - surprises me because I think that it it
187.16 - it should have been better and the
188.92 - return on investment is between 10 and
191.76 - 20 just because we stayed there most of
193.16 - the time I think that's the real reason
195.04 - but none of these numbers like that the
196.88 - success rate's good the numbers don't
198.76 - jump off the screen at me as anything
200.80 - much let's look at a different time
202.52 - period so we look at 20 to 24 um this is
206.72 - a lot more interesting because we
209.12 - actually had SL higher volatility as you
210.96 - remember the success rate's a little
213.04 - higher the average p&l is dramatically
215.84 - higher the um the return on investment
219.72 - is dramatically higher the premium is
221.92 - much higher and the buying power
223.68 - required is also higher these numbers
225.48 - are a lot more interesting and the
227.40 - takeaway from this is that we had much
230.56 - higher volatility post pandemic I don't
233.28 - think it mattered that it was Trump or
234.96 - Biden I think it mattered that it was
237.00 - post pandemic and there was just there
238.88 - was it took follow through for a couple
241.08 - of years but you can see I agree I wish
243.16 - you could point to I wish you could
244.28 - point to Administration and say that
245.68 - there was V to one or the other but
246.80 - there really wasn't no I think this was
248.52 - more of a meme stock thing and then a
250.60 - and then a pandemic thing than anything
252.60 - else so I think I guess the kind of some
255.88 - of the takeaways here is it's hard to
257.36 - predict based on a certain candidate how
259.64 - high volatility is going to be like
261.40 - because I don't I just don't think it's
262.52 - that easy and again and it's hard to
264.84 - predict what kind of you know unknown
266.96 - events are going to happen but higher
268.48 - volatility def definitely leads to
270.36 - better returns in comparing the two
272.60 - different terms we observe the following
275.48 - impacts the average profit and loss
277.48 - increased by more than three times on
278.96 - average in the second term the premium
281.76 - collected was up two times the return
284.00 - investment rose up to three and a half
285.52 - times and the buying power only
287.48 - increased by 1.5 times so just making
290.64 - the argument not making the argument
292.72 - that trading is better under a
294.88 - democratic Administration making the
296.52 - argument that trading is better under
298.60 - higher volatility and trying to say that
300.52 - it really has nothing to do with who is
302.40 - the president has to do with you know
304.16 - what happens and where's the volatility
306.00 - so some of the takeaways when we look at
307.92 - these two presidential terms the last
309.48 - two presidential terms High ivr presents
312.92 - ideal opportunity for selling options
315.16 - however reaching those extreme levels is
316.88 - very rare recognizing that volatility
319.64 - often clusters at lower levels we should
322.16 - consider being more proactive sometimes
324.72 - okay not always but sometimes during the
327.20 - last two presidential CHS we generally
328.72 - saw low volatility lels by adopting a
331.24 - more aggressive approach and managing
332.56 - positions early we're able to increase
333.96 - profits and collect more premiums and
336.48 - that was kind of that was an a across
338.16 - theboard message that's that's generally
339.96 - the case when volatility is low
