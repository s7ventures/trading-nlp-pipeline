0.04 - the vix behavior in Bull and bare
2.96 - markets we're going to take a look and
4.28 - see what the vix does it has this the
6.28 - vix has this inverse relationship to
8.32 - whatever happens in um Market the snps
12.84 - and we're going to see and take a look
14.44 - and see how that kind of plays out over
16.32 - time so on average the vix has a very
19.00 - strong negative correlation with the S&P
20.72 - 500 but we also know that in Market
22.96 - downturns the magnitude of the moves in
24.92 - the market and the vix increase so what
27.16 - is the difference in magnitudes of moves
29.20 - in different Market environments and
31.32 - what can Traders do with this info
33.68 - because sometimes it works and sometimes
35.92 - it don'tuh okay most of the time it does
39.64 - but how much of the time doesn't it
41.52 - actually work and how confusing is that
43.72 - and all that kind of stuff we're going
44.64 - to take a look at everything today so we
46.24 - looked at the last five years because I
47.88 - think for the vix and the snps five
49.92 - years is a little more relevant and we
51.64 - computed the average and go time the
54.16 - less relevant it is yeah yeah yeah I
55.60 - mean the last 5 years we've had plenty
57.16 - of moves we've had a pandemic we've had
58.88 - crazy you know record highs Felts like
61.52 - every year we've had one selloff in 2022
64.72 - so we computed the average and the
66.60 - standard deviation of average vix moves
68.80 - during spy up days and down days and we
70.68 - did it separately and then we computed
72.60 - the conditional probabilities of the vix
74.20 - and the Spy movements you're going to
75.44 - see some fun little stats here so the
77.40 - average move magnitude in the vix is 45%
81.28 - more when the Spy is down and it has a
83.32 - 75% higher variance of moves so when the
86.40 - Spy is up let's say today the Spy is up
88.64 - a little bit the vix tends to move less
91.36 - with a tighter range of moves I don't
93.60 - think that would surprise anybody no
95.44 - when Market's
97.12 - up the vix moves less and it contracts
100.56 - when it's down the vix um has a greater
105.60 - magnitude of the move so we'll take a
107.96 - look here so any vix move on any day um
112.24 - and we looked at up days and then spy
114.72 - down days which I think is pretty fair
118.16 - um 3 point three and per on up dayss and
121.68 - 5.1% on down days that's the mean vix
124.60 - move and then the volatility of vix
126.72 - moves is significantly higher on down
129.16 - days than up days and on any day it's
131.56 - plus or minus 88.5% what's really
134.16 - interesting about this is it it just
137.60 - explains why there's put skew in the
140.52 - index products and it also explains why
143.04 - we spend so much time talking about hey
145.44 - when you have a beta weighted position
146.72 - we like to keep a little bit of short
148.60 - Delta because if protects against those
152.44 - um the volatility in the market on those
156.88 - on those down days that's all it is the
159.16 - Market's more volatile than those down
160.48 - dayss gives you a little bit more
161.52 - protection that's that's that's it
163.48 - that's all it does a little bit of short
164.84 - when you're following the market right
166.28 - sometimes a lot of NASDAQ stocks that
167.64 - you trade the volatility actually go up
169.76 - as the stock goes higher too so you know
171.56 - you got to be a little careful make sure
172.60 - you're in the product I know we're
173.44 - talking about S&P right here yeah we're
174.96 - talking about S&P right now using
176.48 - conditional probabilities we can expand
177.92 - on this concept and say that there's a
180.08 - 21% chance that when the market is up
183.20 - the vix is also up and a 27% chance that
186.64 - when the market is down the vix is also
189.08 - down this is what confuses people
191.48 - because how can the market be up when
193.60 - the vix is up and how can the vix be up
195.40 - with the Market's up and how can the vix
197.28 - be down when the Market's down so there
199.28 - are those times this is what we call
201.52 - keeping people
203.72 - honest okay that this is what does it
206.56 - keeps you honest like well today is
209.32 - probably
210.64 - today's today's a tough one because it's
213.16 - Market's basically Market's mix you got
216.40 - &p Mi vix is only down a couple pennies
218.84 - and the Market's up a little but a
220.40 - minute ago it was down so it's hard it's
222.04 - kind of hard to say um but I just wanted
225.56 - to point this out because sometimes like
227.32 - we'll sit here and we'll go why is the
228.72 - market down and the vix is down or why
230.60 - is the market up and the vix is up well
233.32 - 21 and 27% of the time that's going to
236.24 - happen so let's just say 23 24 % of the
240.28 - time you know just under one quarter of
242.20 - the time that's going to happen so it's
243.80 - not that weird is my point so the
246.48 - probability that the vix goes down when
248.12 - the market goes down is actually the
250.64 - same as the probability that vix goes up
253.28 - when the market goes up this is another
255.12 - reason why we like to be short of little
256.52 - Delta to hedge against the down moves
257.88 - the market what I said before since the
260.32 - chance of a double whammy vix up and
262.24 - Market up it's 21% and the chance of
264.88 - both going in our favor is 27% our hedge
267.60 - will work the same amount if it doesn't
269.32 - but it serves to reduce overall risk in
270.96 - a portfolio it's a crazy way to look at
273.56 - how to keep and track your overall
275.56 - position because all you're trying to do
277.56 - is take advantage of a very small
280.12 - mechanical edge with the vix being down
282.80 - chance of them both going in our favor
284.60 - vix down marketown as opposed to vix up
287.52 - market up and what to expect too like
289.76 - you know if the market goes lower and
292.16 - you have a position like this and you
294.92 - make money having a little bit of long
297.24 - Delta on it it's because volatility raed
300.12 - or expanded to fit your position so you
302.80 - know it's not always about the Delta
304.32 - it's also about the volatility right but
305.96 - what what what what these guys are
307.48 - saying researchers here is that it's 21
310.80 - vers
311.60 - 27% so there's a little tiny bit of edge
314.44 - to keeping maintaining a little bit of
315.80 - short Delta that's all it is because 27%
318.40 - of the time as opposed to 21% of the
319.76 - time it works in your favor I'll take
322.00 - whatever Edge I can get let's go to the
323.84 - next slide so some of the takeaways on
327.16 - average when the market goes up the vix
328.68 - goes down but with less magnitude than
331.00 - when the market moves down and the vix
332.36 - moves up I there's a lot of offsetting
335.32 - stuff here but since the probability of
337.88 - Vick's going down when the Spy goes down
339.72 - is larger than the probability of Vick's
341.00 - going up when the Spy goes up our short
342.92 - Delta hedge will work around the same
344.24 - amount of time as it doesn't the the
347.00 - difference is that we have to remember
348.64 - is that the market goes up more than it
349.88 - goes down so you you you have way more
353.08 - three% of the time is that the number
354.52 - well no it's higher than that now higher
356.48 - it's higher than that it's every day now
358.28 - I mean but I'm just going over to time
360.20 - well it's higher than that for the last
361.52 - couple years it's been closer to like 60
363.88 - 40 MH or 58 42 whatever it is but so so
368.56 - that's what offsets it because there's
370.00 - always something symmetrical that comes
371.40 - out but anyway that's why we maintain a
373.16 - little bit of short Delta that was
374.28 - always our thought process and know now
376.48 - you know why we now you know why we kind
378.56 - of wrote The Mechanics the way we we
380.56 - built the mechanics the way we did them
382.56 - would you skew at Eliz a little bit for
384.36 - stocks that don't have have an inverse
386.20 - relationship to the market
