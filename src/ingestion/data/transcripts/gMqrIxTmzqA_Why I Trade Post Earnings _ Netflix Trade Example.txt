0.80 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
3.44 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
5.12 - you today January 23rd 2025 but first I
9.76 - got to give a big shout out to one of my
12.40 - mentors in trading when I was just an
14.80 - 18-year-old kid Kenny Weiss happy
17.92 - birthday to you my friend thank you for
20.00 - getting me started in this business 83
23.40 - years young I wish you all health and
26.52 - success you can have but anyway right
28.24 - now let's take a quick look at the
30.36 - market even &ps what are they doing
33.28 - they're up
36.28 - $9.75 uh NASDAQ futures are up I'm sorry
40.32 - down $55 and the Russell is up two and
43.68 - change the Dow which has been the
45.68 - strongest of the of the group is up
49.84 - 244 today so far volatility in by 31
53.20 - cents remember his volatility goes lower
55.24 - gives a little bit of um legs to the
57.52 - market usually lifts the market up a
59.64 - little bit higher remember yesterday
61.52 - volatility was a little bit expanded
63.00 - maybe because some of those numbers that
64.32 - were coming out that probably affected
66.24 - the bonds more than anything else but I
68.44 - think kept a little volatility in the
70.84 - market it's now being taken out all
73.32 - right what are we going to do as I
74.48 - always do or I always I typically do I
76.76 - go to my watch list and I look for
78.36 - something uh to trade I usually take out
81.36 - earnings because I don't want to have
83.04 - earnings inside uh my trade so I just
86.20 - click on this earnings and put them in
88.52 - order and you'll see that the earnings
90.00 - start here I'm not going to look at
91.20 - those options when you go through this
93.36 - there's not going to be a lot of options
95.36 - as a lot of stocks here as you can see
97.52 - that have an ivx 5day change that's the
100.72 - implied volatility of each op of each
103.00 - stocks uh implied volatility move over
105.72 - the last 5 days you'll notice Delta
107.96 - Airlines might be a nice C uh nice
110.20 - candidate here uh implied volatility
113.12 - over the last five days is actually
114.88 - expanded uh by 2% with the other stocks
117.96 - like American Airlines that came out
119.44 - with with earnings and other stocks uh
121.92 - in its field coming out with earnings
123.72 - Delta Airlines doesn't have earnings
125.72 - until after uh I think April expiration
130.24 - so that might be a nice candate let's
132.20 - take a quick look at it uh with a with
134.64 - an ivy rank of 36 or 37 the stock has
137.92 - been nothing but straight up maybe a
140.56 - little bit of a fade here maybe a skewed
142.88 - iron Condor we'll go into March options
145.88 - and I look here and you say oh no it
148.48 - does have a good I rank uh sorry implied
151.72 - volatility of 39 we already discussed
153.76 - the IV rank of 36 is good the implied
155.96 - volatility of 39 must be good because
158.72 - the IV rank is good relative to this
161.40 - stocks move with only a $6 expected move
164.92 - when you go about $6 higher uh on on
168.84 - this stock you're you're getting a
170.36 - couple you know you're getting basically
172.48 - dollar options here meaning I'm going to
174.96 - go to the 72 A5 or 75 I like to go to
178.52 - the 15ish delta I guess I would default
180.76 - to the 23 is Delta here and if I go down
183.84 - by the same uh $6 or so trying to go
187.12 - outside that expect to move at 60 or 61
189.88 - 62 is going to be a little bit
192.32 - uh maybe a little bit too close uh
195.08 - probably profit of only 59 or 60 I would
198.20 - probably have to go out another strike
200.52 - here uh to to get that higher pop that I
203.16 - want I want to have that
205.24 - 65 or above pop I'd have to do something
208.96 - like this and for me selling options
210.92 - that are under a dollar uh even though
213.16 - it does use a limited amount of buying
215.12 - power just about $700 or just under
218.64 - $25 for me to get 50% of that to even
222.08 - take a profit of a dollar well it just
224.88 - doesn't seem a good use of capital but I
227.08 - get it it does have the mechanics it
229.36 - does fit um it's basically a delta
232.44 - neutral trade here short five maybe in a
234.88 - smaller account that's something you
236.20 - might want to do that you think is Delta
238.28 - Airlines a little bit more neutral
240.44 - um I also looked at at maybe um a
243.92 - reverse uh Jade lizard uh I looked at
247.20 - maybe selling a put spread I like to
249.76 - sell I collect onethird the width of the
251.52 - strikes so I might have to go to right
253.36 - at the money here what you're noticing
254.96 - here is this low IV or monthly implied
258.00 - volatility or low expected move on the
260.80 - stock doesn't give you a lot of options
262.64 - when I do a reverse Jade lizard which is
264.56 - selling a puts spread and selling a
267.44 - naked call I can't collect $5 here
271.00 - unless I'm going really right at the
272.92 - money a very tight tight um spread here
276.80 - and I don't even collect $5 so I threw
278.88 - out uh Delta Airlines and I decided to
281.72 - go to a post earnings trade in Netflix
285.28 - let me put Netflix up there for you uh
287.68 - Netflix already had earnings you'll
289.56 - notice that the implied volatility the
291.80 - IV rank is relatively low um at
296.04 - 177% very very low something we wouldn't
298.88 - look to sell premium in so I'm going to
300.60 - change my strategy a little bit here uh
303.12 - ivx 5day change obviously after earnings
306.36 - the stocks imply volatility is going to
308.08 - go lower it's 18 down by 18% so you got
312.32 - a applied volatility low you got a
314.48 - relatively low uh monthly implied
316.64 - volatility you got the stock after
318.92 - earnings that's the only positive it had
321.04 - this big pop which leads me to kind of
324.40 - think about trying to fade it I put this
327.00 - trade on when the stock was up $17 you
329.72 - you'll probably be able to put it on
331.40 - better with the stock up $24 right now
334.32 - let's take a look this trade does have
337.12 - um some hidden uh risk to it which I'll
340.12 - explain to you right now I'm going to do
342.28 - a broken wing butterfly in here and I'll
344.76 - explain to you why when you look at a
347.00 - stock like Netflix option pricing one
350.16 - thing if you've been trading or watching
351.84 - this podcast for a long time you should
353.68 - learn is to look for or recognize uh
357.64 - skew if there's put skew or call skew
360.68 - usually in like a product like an ETF
362.96 - like spy there's going to be put skew
366.36 - and usually in a product like a
368.12 - highflying stock like Netflix and Tesla
371.12 - and even Apple they'll usually have call
374.00 - skew if a stock has call skew call
378.00 - spreads trade
380.48 - cheap and naked options trade
385.12 - expensive call spreads trade cheap and
389.60 - naked calls trade expensive when you're
392.68 - looking to sell Naked calls they trade
394.52 - expensive you get a lot of premium for
395.96 - them and when you're looking to buy call
397.84 - spreads they trade cheap you don't pay a
400.08 - lot for them because the expected move
402.88 - is so large let me show you what skew
405.16 - looks like for those who don't if I go
407.08 - to the 980 which is basically the at the
409.52 - money right now and I go up by $100 to
412.96 - 1,080 you'll notice these calls are
415.36 - offered at around
416.80 - $12 if I go to 980 and I go down to 880
421.76 - I'm just going equal distance away
423.96 - you'll notice that these puts are
425.52 - offered at around
427.72 - $825 calls are trading at at um at $12
433.64 - just about $112 and the puts are trading
436.92 - uh just about $8 $4
440.44 - $3.50 in call skew equal distance away a
444.80 - $100 expected move there's an $80
447.60 - expected move in March with 57 days I'm
450.92 - going to march with 57 days because
453.68 - February the monthly options uh in
456.32 - February um with 29 days are too short
459.56 - dated meaning I'm going to have to roll
462.88 - cancel close this trade with 21 days
466.92 - being optimal so I'm going to give
468.48 - myself a little bit of time to be right
470.28 - I'm going to buy one call spread and I'd
473.20 - like to sell a naked option but it's
474.84 - going to use too much buying power for
476.68 - most people's account so I am going to
478.92 - change it and do a broken wing butterfly
482.04 - so I'm going to buy one spread and sell
485.28 - another I've done many of these on this
487.52 - podcast um but I'm going to do one in
490.16 - Netflix right now so I have up here for
492.72 - you to see Delta and probability of
495.80 - touch so when I'm looking to buy a
498.72 - spread I want to have a high probability
503.24 - of touching that number and high for me
507.12 - is about 50% like I want a 50/50 shot
511.48 - that the in the that the spread that I'm
513.28 - buying has a chance to be in the money
515.68 - so let's go to the 1040 calls I'm going
518.88 - to buy one of those even though it only
521.88 - has a 30 Delta there's almost a 60%
524.52 - chance that we will be at 1040 in the
527.92 - next 57 days at some time during the
531.44 - life of this trade you'll notice here
533.88 - and you should be careful these spreads
536.08 - are $20 wide between the two strikes
539.60 - 1040 1060 1080 1100 1120 they're not $10
545.68 - wide as you see here um at a th000 1,000
549.80 - 1,10 th20 th30 1,40 so be careful make
553.64 - sure you're going equal distance away or
556.16 - imbalanced to the amount of strikes that
558.52 - you want to I'm going to when I do a
560.80 - broken wing butterfly I like to buy a
564.68 - $20 um uh $20 wide spread and sell twice
569.84 - as much or double a $40 spread so I'm
573.56 - buying let's do this for for for first
576.44 - I'm buying the 1040 1060 $20 wide spread
582.44 - I'm buying that one one time and now I'm
585.52 - going to sell another
589.80 - 1060 and buy not the 1080 that would be
593.48 - a regular butterfly with a very low
596.16 - probability of success 10% of basically
598.88 - nailing this at 1060 I'm going to go all
602.36 - the way to
603.80 - 1,00 so I'm buying the 1040s one time
606.88 - I'm selling two of the 1060s and I'm
609.32 - buying one of the
611.28 - 1140s I'm $20 wide by $40 wide I'm
617.16 - risking two to make
620.60 - one I'm risking two $40 to make
624.80 - $120 because my Max profit is $2,000 and
628.76 - change 2,000 and whatever you sell this
631.84 - spread for I actually sold it for
634.64 - a157 you could do better than me yes the
637.40 - markets are a little bit wider here I
639.16 - did mine when the stock was up around
641.80 - $19 I got filled just around mid price
645.36 - how did I get filled around mid price I
647.48 - watched as the stock was moving and
649.80 - seeing what the mid price is and I went
651.88 - above if I was looking at this right now
654.08 - with the stock up $24 half dollars I
656.48 - wouldn't expect to get filled at $2 but
659.64 - I would put it in at $2 and then walk it
662.72 - down maybe go down to$ 195 go down to
665.48 - the mid price of 188 and change and then
668.52 - go 5 seven8 cents below mid price if I
672.00 - don't get filled I let it sit right
674.76 - there I got filled at
676.84 - a157 Max profit here on the trade that
679.64 - you're looking at uh is
682.72 - $2,177 that's the credit you received uh
686.12 - plus the width of these strikes so for
688.40 - the18 $0000 in buying power you're using
691.88 - you do have a Max profit of
694.92 - $21.80 but as I showed you that pin of
698.64 - 1060 is relatively small at 10% we can
703.36 - look at what the probability of pinning
705.96 - that
707.08 - $2,000 is by just looking at a butterfly
710.68 - a regular butterfly equal distance $20
713.88 - $20 $20 away to give us what our
717.12 - probability is of having a Max profit of
719.60 - $2,100 so that's not what I'm looking to
721.88 - do what do I really want to happen here
724.72 - with my break even um at around
729.20 - 1,080 uh which is right at that standard
732.52 - uh deviation line that we see here
734.96 - that's dotted line um what's my
737.52 - expectation here well I'm looking to
739.40 - make a dollar maybe a dollar or more on
741.88 - this trade how can I make that dollar a
744.00 - dollar more well you'll notice here this
746.12 - green line there is no risk to the
748.68 - downside side there's no risk to the
750.68 - downside because we are long one spread
753.68 - short another spread defined risk trade
756.32 - my defined risk is $18 $100 and it's all
760.84 - to the upside right at a standard
762.92 - deviation what do I want to happen I
765.20 - want the stock to slowly climb or sit or
769.16 - go down slowly climb sit or go down I
774.00 - want time to go by or I want the stock
776.44 - to go lower or I want the stock to
778.52 - slowly climb up so this out of the money
781.40 - spread that I'm sure it loses some value
783.96 - and this in the money spread um gains a
787.16 - little value volatility can also go
789.84 - lower and this spread would go higher
792.56 - I'm sorry this spread would go lower
794.04 - also but you know what with Ivy rank so
796.96 - low I'm not going to play for that or
799.16 - look to expect for that to happen in
801.68 - this trade why did I say this has a
803.84 - little bit of extra kind of risk to it
806.68 - well a stock is wrapped around $1,000
809.52 - and in this market a lot of stocks have
812.16 - started to uh split one by 10 or uh or
817.56 - 2x5 some split and if we do split this
821.60 - stock that's usually slightly bullish it
824.00 - does play up to our one standard
825.48 - deviation move which can be nice but it
827.84 - will increase the number of contracts
830.20 - you have after the split so if this
833.68 - stock were to split in the next 57 days
836.28 - and it split 10 for one you would have a
838.72 - 10 by 20 by 10 spread when you came in
842.48 - for about 19 cents for where it's
845.20 - trading right now it would still be the
847.16 - same $1.90 in credit it would still be
849.76 - the same amount of buying power nothing
851.88 - would change except for the number of
853.88 - credits that you have all right ladies
856.72 - and gentlemen I hope you enjoyed a
858.24 - couple of hidden lessons in there too
861.24 - some of the reasons why I didn't make a
862.76 - trade some of the reasons why I picked
864.36 - the trade I made and maybe some of the
866.36 - Hidden pitfalls that might even be in
