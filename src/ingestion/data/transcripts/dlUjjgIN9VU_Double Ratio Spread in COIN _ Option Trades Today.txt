0.48 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.76 - Baptist and I have a trade idea for you
4.96 - November 26th 2024 but first as we
8.76 - always do let's take a quick look at the
10.40 - market even the snps are up 20 handles
13.96 - yeah the highs of the day you can see
15.52 - here they trade up to
17.44 - 6,028 or
19.72 - 6,026 right now nzc up 79 Russell down
23.72 - 13 and the Dow down 146 mixed bag of
27.32 - tricks with the Russell and the Dow
29.16 - lower by an equal amount that the &ps
32.32 - and NASDAQ are higher volatility in by
34.72 - 25 cents and you can see volatility
37.08 - getting creamed here the last three or
38.80 - four days good for our existing
40.80 - positions harder to put on new positions
44.44 - so let's take a look at some of those
47.48 - stocks that we might want to put a
48.88 - position on I'm going to go and save you
51.00 - a little bit of trouble here I'm going
52.24 - to show you the stock that I'm going to
54.28 - I'm going back into coin cuz I closed my
57.72 - 1 by two call ratio spread for about a
60.88 - dollar uh profit today when coin was a
63.80 - little bit lower than it is right now at
65.52 - down
66.32 - $6.7 but I do want to show you something
68.76 - here because as you can see here I've
71.20 - set it up as the ivx 5day change from uh
75.32 - the biggest change to any that might be
78.20 - higher today I'm going to go through
79.40 - this list for you and I'm going to show
81.36 - you these are the high option volume
83.36 - list there's really nothing that I like
85.64 - to trade that has ivx that's the
88.52 - five-day implied volatility change going
91.76 - higher um over the last 5 days you can
94.32 - see here all of these stocks here either
96.36 - have earnings or they're just not stocks
98.60 - that I like to trade you know $8 stocks
100.76 - $4 stocks that kind of thing so I'm
103.60 - going to change this now from ivx 5day
106.20 - change to IV rank I'm going to put it in
109.88 - order for you from high to low I'm going
112.32 - to go here and click on it twice and
114.36 - you'll notice that coin pops up here
116.80 - pretty significantly um at the high end
119.36 - of the range now it is down by 18% today
123.44 - the ivx 5day changes not the perfect
126.24 - setup for any type of trade sell premium
129.76 - except that the implied volatility is
132.48 - high so for that reason alone I'm going
135.24 - to take a trade in coin today now you
137.68 - can see how it has significantly dropped
140.28 - here so again it's not the perfect setup
142.80 - but when you look at the IV rank of
144.40 - around 60 it's still at the higher end
148.16 - of where coin typically trades and
151.24 - you'll notice that the stock is at the
153.12 - higher end too so I'm gonna put on a
156.44 - double ratio spread in coin I don't want
159.52 - to put on a 1 by two ratio spread like I
161.88 - had on uh last month because the stock
164.48 - isn't really near its highs I want to
166.76 - give myself a little bit of room to be
168.24 - right I'm going to go on both sides here
170.08 - I'm going to go to January because 45
173.00 - days is optimal 24 days uh to put on a
176.36 - trade in December uh just not uh enough
179.12 - time so I'm going to go to to January on
180.84 - this and I'm going to show you something
182.28 - here I'm going to be
184.56 - um different widths on each one of of
188.24 - these spreads that I'm putting on
189.48 - remember ratio spread is buying one and
192.20 - selling two buying one and selling two
195.24 - it's like a a butterfly buying one
197.60 - selling two buying one but without
199.88 - buying that one that's where you get
201.20 - that extra credit for so I'm going to go
203.08 - $15 wide and I'm going to go all the way
205.64 - down uh to the option that has around a
208.88 - 78 10 Delta on it I'm going to go to the
212.16 - 200 puts I'm going to buy one of those
215.68 - I'm going to sell two of the 15 puts now
221.04 - you'll notice here that I'm getting
222.16 - around a$1 40ish $1 50ish because these
225.24 - markets are quite wide here um on this
228.24 - spread but I'm $15 wide let's look at as
231.44 - a a standalone trade Standalone trade is
233.80 - a 94% pop I mean if you're slightly
236.40 - bullish because this does have long
237.80 - Delta and has a positive data dec of uh
240.76 - $77 a day max profit of $1,600 because
245.00 - remember we're long one of the 200 puts
248.12 - if the stock were to go right down to
249.64 - 185 in the next 52 days and sit right
252.92 - there these 185 puts would be worth zero
255.80 - these 200 puts be worth 15 bucks plus
258.44 - the credit you received on this overall
260.84 - spread um gives you that Max profit of
265.48 - $1,625 buying power $3,800 so it's a
268.32 - standalone trade I I'm well outside the
271.12 - expected move the expected move here or
272.88 - the one standard deviation move is down
274.88 - at this dotted line I'm well outside of
277.28 - that to the downside my break even on
280.16 - this trade is going to be $15 away from
283.36 - the 170 so just under 170 by the amount
287.00 - of credit that I get here all right so
288.84 - that's good Standalone trade I'm going
290.96 - to put on the other side of this
293.40 - remember you got around a125 or so in
296.20 - credit for that put spread now remember
299.36 - I'm going to go a little bit I'm going
300.92 - to be able to go because it call skue
302.96 - much further away from the money
305.00 - remember I'm only $100 away with my long
308.00 - uh being a 200 put
310.56 - $16 away I'm going to go all the way up
313.28 - to the 540 calls I'm going to go around
316.32 - that sameish area you know that 781
319.56 - Delta I'm going to buy one of the 540
323.44 - calls let me unclick this so it'll uh
326.28 - just give me one I'm going to buy one of
328.72 - the 540 calls has around that 789 10
332.32 - Delta and I'm going to go $20 wide here
335.52 - cuz we have $10 wide strikes here we
337.40 - don't have any 545s 555s 565 so I'm
341.68 - going to go $20 wide and I'm going to
345.68 - sell two of the 560 calls now you'll
350.36 - notice um the credit now is about $4 for
353.92 - this call spread maybe even
356.08 - $410 because we got
358.08 - a125 for the put spread $410 for the
361.96 - call spread and we're much further away
364.40 - we're
367.24 - 235 away with our um uh call that we're
373.40 - buying that is definitely a great
376.20 - example of call skew now I'm getting a
379.36 - lot more credit for this making uh
382.08 - making it probably advantageous to maybe
384.04 - if you're a little bit bearish on on the
386.16 - overall position just doing the call
389.20 - side like we had previously done in coin
391.76 - just a few days ago where were able to
393.44 - make a buck pretty quickly on a down
395.32 - move I'm a little bit more neutral-ish
397.16 - now that coin has had down a move but
399.84 - you'll notice I do have a ne5 Delta on
402.56 - here my probably profit is 92% I only
406.20 - got
407.80 - $530 for this spread maybe you'll be
409.84 - able to get a little bit more you'll
410.84 - notice the markets get a little bit wide
412.48 - up here so please take your time uh
415.96 - filling this order going above the mid
417.92 - price even the mid price right now 547
420.60 - go in at 555 or 560 and walk it down by
424.64 - you know 2 three cents each time until
426.44 - you get filled uh possibly as close to
428.64 - Mid price as you could remember as the
430.96 - stock goes higher since this has short
433.44 - Delta to it this price is going to go
435.96 - higher and the better higher credit you
438.72 - get on Entry the better it off it is for
441.24 - you you'll notice that it does take
442.88 - twice as much buying power uh as it did
445.52 - for just selling the put spread a moment
447.20 - ago it uses $6,200 but but my Max profit
450.40 - on the upside now is $20 wide plus the
453.44 - full credit we receive from the put
455.56 - spread and the call spread which is in
457.84 - my case was
459.00 - $530 brings my break even all the way up
462.48 - to
465.12 - $585 and change
467.40 - $585 in change on the upside $160 or a
471.64 - little bit lower on the downside a very
474.32 - high probability trade of 92 uh percent
477.88 - let's take a look at where we'd have to
479.92 - go to the upside I can't even show you
481.52 - because it's just so far away but again
484.24 - my break even
486.00 - $585 I think that Bitcoin has probably
489.52 - run its course uh going into the end of
493.00 - the year so I'm thinking that maybe coin
496.04 - kind of goes sideways we get a little
498.16 - Decay on both sides my break even to the
500.28 - downside like I said is 160ish that's
503.48 - down near its most recent lows made back
506.08 - in
507.16 - September all right ladies and gentlemen
509.28 - that that's my trade for today it use a
511.44 - little bit more buying power than I like
513.08 - to use but you know what it's a very
514.72 - high probability trade with an extremely
516.60 - high amount of credit too at least in my
518.44 - opinion you know what else gives you a
519.96 - lot of high uh probability trades and a
