0.04 - what we asked the research team to do
2.32 - was to look at different streaks in Zer
4.92 - TT trades and I actually put that
8.24 - question in our research uh then let's
10.52 - take a look let's go bth let's take a
11.80 - look nice good for them so the efficient
14.20 - market hypothesis says that information
16.92 - from recent Market action should already
18.60 - be incorporated into current market
20.96 - prices we believe that despite this we
25.40 - recently observed that following losing
28.48 - 45 DT premium position short premium
31.20 - positions with the long premium position
33.12 - could improve performance over long
34.52 - periods just to mess everything up does
37.72 - this hold up when looking at some of the
39.44 - most efficient and liquid assets out
41.60 - there like the zero DT SPX options let's
45.16 - go to next
46.52 - slide so we did a study and this time
49.56 - we're going to 20 months of zero DT
51.72 - option data We examined the 20 Delta
54.72 - strangles that short strangles at the
57.00 - market open with winners Clos at 25% of
59.24 - the initial price and losers left alone
61.88 - we examine the results from four
63.88 - approaches always selling strangles okay
67.44 - mhm always buying strangles okay okay
71.60 - following a winning short strangle with
73.64 - another one but following a losing short
76.84 - with a long
78.04 - strangle so we called that you flipping
80.24 - the cards no no no we're calling that
82.68 - what worked yesterday oh okay all right
85.40 - that's fair enough whatever worked
86.60 - yesterday you do next today okay and
89.68 - then
90.44 - the opposite is reversing that just
91.92 - being contrari okay okay I bet there's
95.12 - going to be some big swings in this I
96.44 - haven't seen it let's let's just go
98.08 - through these one more time so everybody
99.12 - knows what we're looking at this is fun
100.76 - oh no no no Beth go back oh Beth you
103.12 - ruined
104.96 - everything everything you showed us what
108.08 - cup the ball was under always selling
112.92 - when you need them go ahead always
114.76 - selling strangles always buying
117.04 - strangles following we're calling this
119.40 - what we yesterday following short
121.96 - strangles winning short strangles with
123.80 - another one or following losing short
125.96 - strangles with a long strangle so
127.16 - flipping it over or reversing that and
130.08 - following winnings with winning short
132.20 - strangles with a long strangle and win
135.32 - and losing um and losing long strangles
139.08 - with a short strangle okay so just the
141.32 - complete opposite and then all trades it
144.00 - got out no there no wings on this trade
145.76 - if you want to do Wings subtract a
147.12 - little money let's let's next slide and
150.48 - see where we we ended up okay 20 Delta
153.84 - short
155.44 - strangles if all you did was sell
157.68 - strangles 93% winners and we haven't
160.64 - done the streaks yet if all the
163.80 - strangles were bought 66% winners how
167.80 - could that be the answer is because
170.36 - remember we're only taking profits of
171.60 - 25% that's true so you can take a 25%
174.24 - profit on the short strangle and you can
175.96 - also make money in the long strangle
178.20 - potentially later on the day whatever
179.84 - ever at
180.68 - 25% so they're doing this
183.52 - intraday these are zero DTS these are
185.92 - all zero DTS I no no no but I mean this
187.52 - flip not flipping the Cards doing
189.20 - whatever happened yesterday they're
191.20 - waiting till the day to close and then
192.44 - doing it right the next day no no
193.88 - closing at 25% it's not waiting to the
195.56 - end of the day so whatever if you close
196.80 - the 25% that you just do got so the next
198.92 - one is what worked yesterday it's
200.52 - actually just what worked okay and that
203.80 - came out at 90% if you did the opposite
205.60 - it came out at 66% 69% here's the crazy
208.76 - thing everything got
211.24 - paid I know but I don't want to put that
213.48 - message out there that's a that's a
215.64 - strong that's a strong message you know
217.16 - what this message is the message is you
219.00 - got to manage 25% that is the message it
221.52 - almost doesn't matter what you do if you
223.08 - manage 25% because short strangles long
226.40 - strangles flipping over doing whatever
229.68 - worked yesterday and doing the opposite
231.60 - of what worked yesterday everything
233.36 - worked crazy that's we need start
235.36 - trading more more zero days which I've
237.00 - told you in the past
240.52 - okay let's go to the next
244.32 - slide so here now we get into a little
247.24 - bit different choosing high probability
249.68 - trades means mostly seeing winners with
253.00 - a few losers sprinkled in but how
255.92 - frequently do we get a winner every day
258.08 - of the week more importantly how often
261.44 - do losers follow
263.96 - losers so next we're going to look at
266.04 - how frequently our short and long
268.32 - positions with managed
270.76 - winners acred one two or
274.56 - three or more consecutive winning
278.76 - days and that's kind of a weird way to
281.48 - look at it but let's have short and long
283.48 - positions with managed winners occurred
285.92 - one two three yeah how often do losers
288.28 - follow Lo how often do losers follow
291.12 - losers follow
292.96 - losers and we're doing what worked
295.16 - yesterday and it's another how often do
296.88 - winners follow because this is streaks
299.12 - okay so we're going to look at these and
300.76 - and crewing them consecutive days let's
302.68 - go to next slide
304.16 - be okay so this slide here because it's
307.20 - the hell am I looking at here okay it's
308.84 - hard to look at but the top says short
311.88 - strangles right
313.64 - Beth yes Tom okay and in the left
317.72 - hand um because I can't read it from
320.04 - where I'm sitting says frequency says
322.08 - frequency and the bottom consecutive
325.28 - winners okay so the left side says
328.40 - frequency and the bottom access
332.96 - says consistent winners maybe
336.24 - consecutive winners consecutive I
337.76 - couldn't see it thank you that's pretty
339.72 - impressive in the short
342.00 - strangle
343.68 - um you definitely take more risk oh I
346.64 - got it it's on my screen now perfect so
349.84 - cons uh short
351.48 - strangles the frequency and then the
353.60 - consecutive winners yeah that's a that's
355.52 - a very interesting way to look at this
359.20 - and
360.16 - you take more risk because you're short
361.96 - the strangles and so you get this pretty
365.52 - impressive reward let's go to the next
368.52 - slide now this one is long
373.16 - strangles very different but it's still
377.96 - positive okay and you can see the
380.56 - frequency and you can see the
382.24 - consecutive winners basically what this
384.64 - is saying is that regardless of the
387.88 - strategy you select if as long as you
390.36 - manage early because these are all
392.40 - managed early you're going to be in the
393.60 - fight you're going to be in the fight
395.28 - yep exactly yep you're going to be in
396.96 - the fight at if you go to the next slide
398.88 - for nearly the past two years let's see
401.64 - if they come up with the same thing that
403.12 - we came up with zero DT strangles trade
405.72 - at the market opening have been
406.84 - profitable for retail Traders short
409.36 - strangles were more frequently
411.56 - profitable with nearly 50% of two we
415.00 - periods being 10 out of 10 winners let's
418.52 - go back to slides for a second
420.92 - Beth these are short strangles and you
423.92 - can see
426.08 - frequency let's see where is 50% yeah
428.72 - you can see that's kind of like right at
430.52 - the mid access and these are these are
434.56 - like 10 out of 10 winners you can see
437.16 - that and so go back to the last slide
439.64 - seven out of
441.12 - seven um so for short strangles they're
444.44 - more frequently profitable with nearly
446.92 - 50% of the twoe periods being 10 out 10
448.80 - winners long strangles on the other
452.04 - hand that's that one perfect go back to
455.92 - the last slide long strangles on the
457.68 - other hand rarely went a week without a
459.76 - loss but had far gentler bad losses as
463.64 - me measured by siar so whichever side
466.68 - you took as long as you're willing to
469.00 - capture profits
470.56 - rapidly net profits were surprisingly
473.32 - close that's exactly what that was our
475.24 - same observation as long as you're
477.32 - willing to capture profits so it looks
479.60 - like everything falls apart if you hold
481.68 - everything too long when genius fails
484.00 - yes think something going to happen it's
486.40 - going to reverse it's going to do this
487.92 - when you try to squeeze everything yes
491.20 - very good
