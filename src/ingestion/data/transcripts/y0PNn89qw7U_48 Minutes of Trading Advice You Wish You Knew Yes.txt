0.04 - so for today I'm going to talk about
2.04 - monitoring your positions how to set
4.44 - that up how to do that adjusting your
7.12 - positions closing and rolling those
10.32 - positions and redeploying capital okay
15.00 - for starters I think you know this
17.20 - sounds this is going to sound a little
19.36 - beginner likee but you wouldn't believe
23.40 - how many questions we get about
26.20 - practical watch lists and acable
28.20 - actionable watch lists in fact until
30.76 - we've kind of re-engineered the way
33.84 - people look at Futures and and equities
37.84 - I don't think most people understand
39.84 - kind of or I don't think most people
41.36 - that trade really understand the role of
43.96 - kind of like what where your ey should
45.96 - focus on so the first thing when
47.60 - building um when when looking at your
49.92 - platform and deciding hey how am I going
52.80 - to manage my positions well I think it's
56.36 - super important to build a watch list
59.16 - every platform has a watch list on it
61.12 - the problem that most people make with
62.28 - watch lists are they follow the stocks
63.92 - that they like and on a day like today
66.12 - you might find some NASDAQ stocks lower
68.04 - you might find some other stocks higher
69.80 - but you're not really sure what's going
71.16 - on so watch list should start with the
74.40 - front month index Futures in descending
77.48 - order so and I I know I'm being very
80.92 - specific here and very particular but
83.68 - you have to understand what drives
85.84 - markets and what moves markets are the
88.56 - index Futures as that's the largest most
91.64 - liquid pool of liquidity in the world
94.08 - and it's and when we say it's it's the
95.88 - most Capital efficient pool of liquidity
98.04 - so big money will flow into
100.68 - institutional money retail money
102.04 - whatever it is it will flow into index
103.92 - Futures which will move the market and
105.60 - the stocks will follow so on your watch
107.96 - list and also Futures are
109.96 - 245 so from Sunday night at 5 o'clock
113.36 - till Friday night basically at 5:00
115.56 - we're talking about um the Futures
117.68 - markets are open and what's important
119.56 - about that is it gives you a really good
121.04 - idea of what is driving the equity
123.44 - markets so what I do is I start with for
125.84 - example es which are the S&P 500s NQ
128.68 - which are the NASDAQ you know ym which
130.84 - is the Dow or rty which is the Russell
133.84 - start with those four and then list
135.40 - other liquid Futures below that that's
137.44 - how you start to build a watch list and
140.76 - then following that you want to put all
144.64 - your liquid equities Now liquid equities
148.16 - mean that the options are probably liid
150.32 - sometimes you'll find an option
151.68 - Marketplace that's super liquid when the
153.56 - equity itself or the index isn't really
155.32 - that liquid but it's rare So what I do
158.28 - is following in descending order
161.32 - following my
162.48 - Futures okay I will then and I will list
164.64 - them in groups like you know I will put
166.64 - gold silver next to gold I'll put 10e
169.28 - notes next to bonds that kind of thing
171.16 - but then following that I will list
173.12 - equities most liquid equities first like
175.48 - you'll probably start off with you know
177.36 - the top seven or eight most actively
179.20 - traded under L and then all the way down
181.56 - to let's call it the first I don't know
183.56 - could be 75 to 200 it doesn't really
185.88 - matter on a separate tab you should also
189.56 - have your positions if you're on a
191.00 - platform that doesn't support watch
193.52 - lists that include you know that that
195.56 - have give you the flexibility to set
197.28 - these up and have Futures followed by
200.28 - equities and then also a separate one
202.12 - with positions then you really need to
204.80 - consider a different trading platform
207.24 - because you it's almost imp possible in
210.76 - 2024 to trade without understanding what
214.28 - the Futures markets are doing and
216.28 - understanding you know how the option
217.88 - markets relate to the Futures markets
219.28 - being able to follow it all with make
221.28 - eye contact with that and then also
223.40 - being able to flip quickly to your
224.88 - position to a list of all your positions
227.60 - and then what's super important and
230.56 - what's something that that I I'm excited
233.16 - about the way technology has developed
235.40 - since the early days of you know the
237.24 - early days of when we were building
238.32 - thinkers some to where we are today with
239.80 - tasty um we we've come a long way and we
244.56 - now can take our watch list and sort
246.32 - watch lists by just you know pretty much
248.72 - 50 or 60 different different things and
251.60 - if you learn to sort by ivr and
254.32 - liquidity it really helps and what I
256.48 - posted here on the first slide was just
258.64 - an example of sorting by ivr and
260.72 - liquidity so for example these are um
264.48 - seven different stocks which I have some
266.68 - positions in Boeing meta smci Google AMD
269.80 - Nvidia and mu but what I did was I
272.76 - sorted these not by an alphabetical
275.40 - order or anything like that but I sorted
277.20 - these by IV Rank and then I also
279.80 - included the next column over by
281.28 - liquidity so you can see like some have
283.32 - a two star liquidity some have three
284.68 - star some have four star liquidity you
286.36 - know Google and AMD with fourstar
287.76 - liquidity I would argue right now Nvidia
289.72 - easily has four-star liquidity but some
292.00 - like smci might have two star liquidity
294.24 - what's interesting about this is on
296.40 - different platforms now you can sort by
298.12 - liquidity if you want but I always sort
300.20 - by IV rank because I want to know where
304.20 - implied volatility is relative to itself
307.16 - when I am a holding positions or B
310.76 - putting on new positions because today's
313.04 - segment is on managing existing
315.12 - positions managing your portfolio what I
317.28 - want to know is in my open in my list of
320.32 - open positions which has the highest
323.52 - implied volatility rank because those
325.08 - are the ones I'm going to roll forward
326.96 - so if I looked at this for example I
328.28 - look at Boeing I say okay definitely
330.04 - rolling that forward now all of these
331.36 - are high so they're all plus 50 so all
333.76 - of these I'm going to roll forward but
336.60 - sometimes you'll find one where the IV
338.24 - rank is in single digits like you might
340.04 - have a spy position on where the IV rank
341.68 - is eight or you might have another
343.40 - position on like bonds where the IV rank
346.12 - is one in those cases you're probably
349.28 - not going to roll those positions
350.68 - forward you might close those positions
353.32 - being able to set your watch lifts up
357.24 - and to be able to sort it by ivr lets
359.96 - you immediately know which stocks in
363.20 - your portfolio you are going to roll and
366.12 - which stocks you are going to
369.16 - close and you know it can also give you
371.48 - an idea based on liquidity can also give
372.88 - you an idea based on p&l but IV rank is
375.76 - the simplest and most consistent and we
378.16 - are we are fighting today for
380.88 - consistency this is all about
382.84 - consistency now a lot of these slides
384.72 - are a little heavy because I included a
386.52 - ton of information on these especially
387.88 - the first few so just be with me if
390.20 - these are if it's new to you or it's or
392.88 - it's a little difficult don't worry
394.76 - everything we do is designed to be
396.36 - challenging but I think if you once you
398.96 - see it enough and there's enough
400.00 - repetition it will make a lot of sense
403.60 - so the next thing I want when you're
405.60 - when you're deciding how you're going to
407.00 - manage your position you've got to do a
409.28 - quick scan of the individual Greeks
411.48 - whether you have on and your pnls
413.92 - whether you have on one position five
416.80 - positions 10 positions or 80 positions
419.20 - it does doesn't matter so what we do is
421.72 - we use native Greeks the those are
424.88 - non-ba weighted for Equity options
428.56 - Equity option positions and our Equity
430.96 - index positions I'll get to Futures in
433.24 - one second but we use native Greeks that
435.72 - means non-ba weighted for Equity options
438.08 - indexes this is not our total this is
440.44 - just our individual positions now the
442.56 - reason I'm telling you this is because
443.92 - people get very confused when they beta
445.84 - weight everything to the Spy and they
447.72 - get very confused when they when
449.56 - individual positions are beta weighted
451.20 - to the Spy because it looks a little
452.48 - weird but that's why we use the native
455.28 - Greeks non-ba weighted for Equity
457.48 - options ETFs and indexes if possible and
461.32 - this is not available on every platform
462.96 - but it is available on tasty we use ETF
466.20 - Greeks for all Futures positions and all
469.16 - Futures options positions so we allow
471.52 - you to compare apples to apples I feel
474.08 - this was an very important adjustment we
476.32 - made to the platform and what it allows
478.68 - you to do is have a position on in
480.84 - Nvidia have a position on in IBM have a
484.08 - position on for example in let's just
486.84 - say in Reddit and compare that to a
489.92 - position in the snps and a position in
492.32 - crude oil because everything is set to
496.32 - an equity equivalent because Futures on
499.44 - their own get very complicated when you
501.76 - take a Futures Greek because it has
504.08 - different multipliers so if you want to
506.92 - normalize Futures and make them a part
509.08 - of your portfolio which I think is
511.32 - incredibly important a for Capital
513.68 - efficiency which is the main thing but
516.28 - it's it's Capital efficiency and also
519.20 - because they are non-correlated so we'
521.48 - love you to do is to include Futures and
524.32 - Futures options positions along with
527.52 - your Equity positions but in order to
529.40 - compare apples to apples what we do is
532.52 - we normalize everything by using native
535.32 - non-ba weighted Greeks for for
537.88 - individual equities and then for futures
540.56 - we convert everything to their Equity
544.64 - equivalent so for example es would be
546.92 - converted to spy but as you see below
549.44 - fruit oil is converted to
551.16 - Uso because then we can con we can
553.92 - convert Uso to spy in in the big picture
556.72 - and it's much simpler now for p&l and
559.52 - this is what also confused a lot of
561.04 - people and I know I'm kind of going over
562.52 - stuff that you like thinking wow I've
564.44 - never heard this before because nobody
565.80 - really covers this stuff but for p&l you
569.08 - should default to a daily p&l for your
571.20 - individual underlyings your overall
573.44 - totals you're always going to use daily
575.16 - p&l but for individual underlyings I
577.20 - also use daily p&l a lot of people look
579.52 - at open p&l and a lot of people look at
582.04 - different other kinds of p&l like could
584.36 - be individual position pnl stuff like
586.08 - that what you should look at is daily
587.64 - p&l for the individual positions daily
589.88 - p&l for individual underlying because it
591.44 - quickly tells you if a position you have
593.20 - on is out of whack meaning the Deltas
595.64 - are too far off because you're losing
596.72 - more money you should or you're making
598.08 - more money whatever it is but if you
600.80 - have a p&l number that looks out of
602.32 - whack compared to everything else then
604.56 - you'll know it immediately by looking at
606.04 - your p&l you can also tell by looking at
607.68 - your Greeks and your Delta and maybe
609.96 - your Theta but your Delta for sure but
611.88 - your p&l will confirm everything it
613.96 - gives you kind of that instant
615.44 - confirmation also you need to develop
619.44 - consistent comfortable guidelines for
622.28 - managing your daily risk because some
624.56 - people will look at it all day long some
626.04 - people will log on 10 times a day some
627.84 - people look at it once a day some people
629.08 - look at once a week and whatever that is
632.80 - okay you have to be consistent and you
634.68 - have to have guidelines and manageable
636.12 - positions that fit within that on the
638.80 - right hand side of this page you see I
640.52 - put a couple of symbols coinbase for
642.52 - example my p&l let's just say today is
644.84 - $125 plus and the position Delta it's an
648.84 - individual position Delta those are coin
650.76 - Deltas those those are not converted to
653.00 - spy is 15 Del long 15 Deltas in the yes
657.12 - my p&l is down $50 now those converted
660.80 - to spy equals 30 spy Deltas not es
663.04 - Deltas but spy Deltas CL which is crude
666.20 - oil I converted those with a plus 100
669.20 - p&l I converted those to Uso Deltas to
671.88 - make it simple because you understand
673.40 - that and Nvidia the same thing to 35
676.56 - individual Nvidia Deltas now you'll see
678.52 - what we do with those in a second but
680.08 - this gives you some background for
681.80 - developing again first thing I want to
684.00 - do is make sure you do the watch list
685.44 - right second thing make sure you set up
687.16 - your Greeks right and you're looking at
689.00 - the thing which is your daily p&l and
691.52 - everything is is set up and converted to
694.84 - what it should look like so that you are
696.36 - comparing Apples to
698.12 - Apples so on the next slide we're going
701.04 - to now start looking at your overall
702.96 - account risk because you don't know what
706.04 - to monitor in your positions until you
708.96 - know how your overall account risk is
711.12 - looking and how you're doing so here's
713.12 - where we combine all the position Greeks
716.08 - and we beta weight everything to the Spy
718.68 - now could you beta weight to the to the
720.92 - es or the mees or could you beta weight
723.16 - to the SPX and the answer is yes but we
726.36 - don't we don't for consistency we don't
729.48 - because otherwise people get really
731.52 - confused and when people say hey my
733.32 - position is X or my position is why it's
736.28 - because everybody's been beta weighted
737.84 - to different things so to simplify
739.76 - everything we just beta weight
740.76 - everything to the Spy it makes it
742.60 - normalizes everything it commoditized
744.96 - everything but you need to know the
746.92 - relationship between the spy and the SPX
749.92 - the Spy is one10 the size of the SPX you
752.40 - need to know the relationship between
755.44 - the spy and Es the es is 1/ half the
758.68 - size of the SPX so the es is one5 the
761.80 - size is I'm sorry the es is five times
763.52 - the size of spy and the mees is one10
766.76 - the size of the es once you understand
769.36 - those they're all the same product so
771.60 - before we go off and and think oh my God
773.40 - these are all different no they're not
774.48 - they're all the same product the spy and
776.44 - the SPX I mean they all have their
777.88 - little nuances they all might have a
779.84 - different they might have a different
781.64 - like one has dividends one doesn't one
783.68 - has the carry cost built in one doesn't
786.28 - one has a different kind of settlement
788.68 - than the other one all that kind of
789.84 - stuff but the reality is they're all the
791.60 - same they're all S&P 500 and once you
794.16 - understand that the SPX is 10 times the
795.56 - size of the Spy the es is five times the
797.56 - size of the spy and the mees is one1 the
800.80 - size of the es or the equivalent Mees is
804.00 - the equivalent of 50 shares of spy so
806.96 - two Mees equal one spy that that allows
809.68 - you to normalize your portfolio risk
811.96 - because you can convert it into anything
813.20 - you want then what we do is we look at
815.40 - our Theta number we're not going to get
816.68 - into all the Greeks we're just going to
818.52 - look at Delta because you have your beta
820.48 - weighted Deltas now everything is beta
821.96 - weighted to the Spy and then we're going
823.60 - to look and we're going to see and and
825.28 - we're going to understand a reasonable
827.96 - daily Theta to net lick ratio you can't
830.64 - manage a portfolio unless you know what
832.96 - you're looking for so I'm going to get
834.64 - into that in one second and then also we
836.96 - want to make sure that your Deltas are
838.36 - in line with your Market Marketplace
839.48 - assumptions so for example if you are
842.16 - bullish and you are short Deltas your
845.00 - Deltas are not in line with your
846.28 - Marketplace assumption if you are
848.04 - bearish and you are long Deltas your
850.12 - Deltas are not in line with your
851.44 - Marketplace assumption so what you want
853.44 - to do is make sure your Deltas are in
855.32 - line with your Marketplace assumptions
857.00 - and then make sure that your daily data
860.08 - to your net lick not to your buying
862.04 - power not to something else but to your
864.12 - net lick because that's the easiest way
865.28 - to do it and to make it consistent is
867.88 - going to be some reasonable number what
869.56 - is a reasonable number well it's hard to
871.44 - tell based on different account sizes
873.76 - but what we've come up with in all our
875.60 - modeling is that the total portfolio
878.92 - Theta um divided by net lick or relative
882.40 - to net lick should be 1110th to onethird
885.92 - or 10 to 30 basis points of your net
889.24 - lick okay so if you're at 1% if your net
892.60 - lick for example is
894.24 - $100,000 and you have a $100,000 and you
897.16 - have $1,000 of daily decay you have way
899.40 - too big a position but if you have $200
902.32 - of daily Decay on a $100,000 position
904.92 - you're right dead smack in the middle of
906.56 - where we think you should
907.92 - be now again these are generalizations
911.12 - but this comes from 13 years worth of
912.88 - research so we feel pretty confident in
916.12 - our numbers and all the stuff that we
917.76 - study we're going to talk a little bit
919.28 - later about what your expectations
920.52 - should be around that but from 1110th to
923.40 - 1/3 is kind of a reasonable Theta to net
926.80 - lick expectation or where you should be
931.04 - and the last piece here be mechanical
933.52 - take a disciplined approach to managing
935.92 - your positions like don't overthink this
938.48 - don't say oh this stock's down so I'm
940.76 - not going to adjust my position because
942.08 - I think it's going to Rally back up
943.72 - that's how you get in a lot of trouble
945.12 - or this Stock's up and I think it's
946.76 - going to go back down so I'm not going
947.84 - to roll up my puts or do whatever that's
949.68 - how you get in trouble so don't do that
951.56 - just be mechanical you have to take a
952.96 - discipline approach and you have to kind
954.56 - of clear your head but you always need
957.16 - to know your next step so one of the
959.12 - keys to managing a portfolio is knowing
961.04 - what you're going to do next don't sit
963.56 - there and think oh man oh man let me go
965.48 - back and rewatch this this video go let
968.52 - me go back and rewatch this webinar you
970.56 - need to know what your next step is you
971.92 - need to know based on what strike you
973.72 - already have what your next strike is
975.20 - you need to know based on what
976.12 - expiration you're in are you going to
977.40 - stay in that same expiration are you
978.52 - going to roll to another expiration our
981.08 - default adjustment you've heard me say
982.68 - this many times before our default
984.80 - adjustment is always earlier is better
988.92 - earlier is better there is never a time
991.52 - when later is better now of course
994.16 - sometimes I shouldn't say never because
995.80 - sometimes if you wait sure you get lucky
997.40 - things like that but the default should
999.56 - always be ear if you're if you're
1000.88 - undecided earlier is better and assume
1005.00 - you will meet risk expectations or
1007.76 - reduce you know or you have to reduce
1010.08 - your position size now down below what
1012.28 - we did is we put just together a little
1014.00 - example showing what happens when you
1015.64 - manage early verse what happens when you
1017.88 - hold to expiration and you can see the
1019.84 - pop is higher a little bit higher one
1021.56 - one or two% when you hold to expiration
1023.64 - but the average daily p&l is actually
1025.24 - higher when you manage your trades early
1026.96 - and your p&l volatility is a third and
1029.88 - your SAR which is your outlier risk
1032.48 - drops by
1033.64 - 2/3 what do we care about when we're
1035.84 - trading and managing a portfolio we care
1037.92 - about our outlier risk we care about our
1041.00 - three our two standard deviation risk
1042.64 - which is basically what your crar is
1044.08 - that's conditional value of risk we care
1046.08 - about the volatility of your portfolio
1048.64 - which which is how big are your intraday
1050.16 - swings if you can reduce your intraday
1051.96 - swings by 2/3 and your outlier Risk by
1054.24 - 2/3 you manage early and increase your
1056.72 - daily p&l you manage early that's it
1059.84 - Case Closed there is no other argument
1061.88 - to be made here for this I'm going to
1064.12 - keep moving ahead so I keep this keep us
1065.84 - on pace so the next piece and again if
1069.04 - you have any questions I'm Tom at
1071.08 - tasty.com and there are three people on
1073.28 - answering questions today and I'll give
1075.08 - you some other information at the end of
1076.88 - the event okay the next piece is called
1080.28 - adjusting your positions right we're
1082.84 - going to adjust positions
1085.32 - so this is where sometimes it gets a
1088.16 - little confusing and and listen this is
1089.84 - why we're doing a two-hour and 45 minute
1091.40 - show with six different speakers and the
1094.04 - six speakers are Nikki Batista Mike
1096.60 - Butler Katie mcgo um Jamal Chandler
1099.88 - myself and uh Pete mad so this is like
1103.36 - you know this is as good as we've got so
1106.44 - I think you know you're going to get
1107.44 - lots of different perspectives and you
1109.92 - know I would do my best to get out and
1112.12 - make it to one of these events um the
1114.60 - first thing the don't forget the three
1117.60 - Rs roll up or down the untested side to
1121.00 - reduce Delta so when you're going
1122.24 - through your positions you look at the
1123.96 - market just opened and you're looking at
1125.76 - your positions and you see that your
1127.64 - Deltas are a little out of whack in one
1129.72 - underline like you think you should be
1131.20 - flat but now all of a sudden you're
1132.76 - short 200 Deltas then what you're going
1134.64 - to do is and assuming you have a put end
1136.52 - call position on you're G to take that
1138.80 - put position whether it's a spread or
1140.56 - whether it's a naked put and you're
1142.12 - going to roll it up we call that rolling
1145.00 - up the untested side the tested side is
1147.36 - the side that's being challenged that's
1148.96 - creating the Deltas but you're going to
1150.12 - touch that you're only going to touch
1151.52 - the untested side if we're going down
1154.08 - and you're picking up too many long
1156.00 - Deltas you're going to take your call
1157.84 - side and roll your calls side down we
1159.36 - call that rolling down the next thing we
1161.36 - do is if we get a little bit too close
1163.72 - after a couple of rolls we call this
1166.24 - reentering which is done to reduce Delta
1169.12 - and to lower your gamma risk what that
1171.20 - is is you buy the guts that's the that's
1173.76 - the that's the two nearest to at the
1176.12 - money strikes and then you buy those
1178.48 - back in a single click you sell out the
1180.60 - wings if your platform doesn't support
1183.12 - that functionality in a single click
1185.48 - change your platform because that's old
1187.64 - technology that doesn't that's not even
1189.76 - viable in 2024 and the next thing is
1193.56 - rolling out in time so rolling out in
1195.68 - time means going from the current month
1197.88 - to the next month now all of these apply
1200.68 - to listed options ETFs
1204.04 - indexes Futures options okay same thing
1207.64 - there is no difference if you're trading
1209.44 - crude oil es options NQ options if
1213.28 - you're trading natural gas options if
1215.60 - you're trading uh copper options or if
1217.96 - you're trading soybeans or bonds or or
1221.28 - node options they're all the same thing
1223.36 - you roll up or down the untested side
1225.52 - you reenter with one click buy the guts
1228.08 - and sell the wing or you roll out in
1230.24 - time calendar if we call that
1232.24 - calendarize the trade so you move the
1234.24 - trade out to the next cycle in the
1235.80 - future's world we call it moving to the
1237.20 - active month in the listed world we call
1239.68 - it we call it calendarized the trade
1241.76 - that reduces your risk by about 30%
1244.84 - calendarized a trade reduces Risk by 30%
1247.84 - so again the three Rs rolling up or down
1250.16 - the untested side reentering and then
1252.28 - rolling out in time and remember the
1254.88 - rules of thumb always get comfortable
1257.52 - doing this early and always be
1259.84 - comfortable taking profits and do not
1262.96 - add to losing positions one of the
1265.00 - things we we get our we have egos and
1267.40 - our egos get in the way a lot and our
1268.72 - egos sometimes tell us hey you know what
1271.44 - I love this position but I just can't
1273.12 - believe it's going against me so I'm
1274.04 - going to do more unless you've done it
1275.80 - really small the first time and you have
1277.64 - a lot more room to go don't add to
1279.04 - losing positions you'll hang around this
1280.92 - business forever if you don't add to
1282.12 - losing positions soon as you start
1283.52 - adding losing positions it's over
1286.24 - because you can't recover from that so
1288.80 - um get comfortable taking profits manage
1290.96 - early don't add to losing positions and
1292.96 - don't forget the three
1294.80 - Rs so the next piece is don't
1298.28 - personalize the
1299.92 - mechanics what that means is and this is
1302.20 - a new kind of saying for us stay
1304.60 - disciplined and consistent honor the
1306.84 - research honor the discussions that
1308.72 - we're having today at least trust them I
1311.56 - shouldn't say honor I should have said
1312.92 - trust it well next time we say it's
1314.52 - trust the research but the reason for
1317.20 - that is because again we have these egos
1320.08 - we have we all have a very similar
1322.48 - personality Traders have this kind of
1324.72 - alpha like personality and it makes us
1328.20 - pigheaded and you must stay consistent
1331.92 - and you must trust the research so if
1334.80 - the suggestion is hey roll off the
1336.20 - onesti side roll off the onesti side if
1338.36 - it's roll down the onesti side roll down
1340.32 - the onesti side no no legging okay we
1343.52 - generally don't leg I mean if you leg
1345.32 - one time out of 10 fine if you leg one
1347.72 - time out of 20 one time out of a 100
1349.80 - fine I don't care of course we don't
1351.12 - care but if you get in the habit of
1353.08 - starting to leg every trade you're dead
1355.52 - dead meat it's not going to work and
1357.76 - don't get cute okay that means that
1360.28 - means don't say okay I'll do this first
1362.20 - and I'll leg into this side or I'll do
1363.92 - this and that you know like this is not
1366.56 - you don't get paid for being cute and
1368.44 - nobody cares how how you know if you
1370.92 - saved a penny or something so we call
1372.84 - that no hero stuff change the word my my
1376.28 - the word stuff you I usually was is n
1378.76 - that nice I changed it to a nice word so
1382.68 - don't get cute and no hero stuff and we
1385.28 - don't lag and then remember strategic
1389.00 - optimization works trust the research
1392.24 - the reason I do this the reason I do
1395.08 - this after all these years decades
1397.48 - whatever it is is because I want my
1400.40 - legacy to be that we have
1404.08 - created a platform of strategic
1407.80 - mechanics of strategic optimization that
1411.12 - allows individual investors
1413.48 - self-directed traders to compete with
1416.76 - anybody any time in any
1419.76 - Marketplace the world the the the world
1422.36 - of open outcry gone the world of
1424.20 - traditional quote professional traders
1426.08 - gone yeah sure there's high frequency
1427.76 - machines and everything else I don't
1429.12 - care about that the the world of of
1432.88 - self-direct investing self-directed
1434.56 - trading it's all about strategic
1436.60 - optimization you must optimize your
1439.32 - knowhow that is your true differentiator
1441.80 - so trust the
1444.80 - research so the next thing is to get
1447.08 - comfortable being
1448.60 - counterintuitive okay that's why we do
1450.80 - not adjust the test inside that's why we
1453.76 - focus on the untested side because it's
1457.28 - counterintuitive we focus on Capital
1459.84 - efficiency not always what seems like
1463.12 - the maybe the the best potential move
1466.24 - but the most Capital efficient move so
1468.56 - you're not throwing in good money after
1470.16 - bad we also always focus and this is
1473.28 - really important when you are managing
1475.04 - your positions and you're managing your
1476.68 - portfolio we focus on increasing the
1479.32 - credits and lowering Delta whenever it's
1482.36 - possible like I know positions go
1484.68 - against us I get it trust me I've had
1487.24 - millions of losing positions literally
1489.48 - millions of losing positions so I get
1491.32 - this increase credits whenever you can
1494.36 - which reduces risk and lower Delta when
1497.00 - you can and then don't add money or
1500.12 - contracts to trades that are not working
1502.56 - if something's not working okay it's not
1504.60 - working doesn't mean you have to close
1505.80 - it you can stay in you can fight the
1507.68 - good fight you can stay in you can
1509.76 - battle to The Bitter End but you're not
1511.76 - GNA add money to the trade which is how
1513.84 - which is you do that by increasing
1515.20 - credits not not not paying debits and
1518.00 - you do that by lowering Delta as much as
1519.60 - you can sometimes the stock wins
1522.72 - sometimes trades don't work so focus on
1525.16 - Capital efficiency be comfortable being
1527.80 - counter intuitive try not to adjust the
1530.28 - tested side ever now here's a nice
1532.96 - little slide here it shows that we're
1534.96 - looking at Short puts and we did it in
1537.52 - the spy and the es and this is what
1540.64 - capital efficiency is all about now I'm
1542.72 - never going to tell you hey just trade
1544.52 - spy or just trade es we trade it all we
1547.80 - love the fact that this event being
1549.56 - sponsored by both the CME which is which
1553.04 - is our primary Futures exchange and the
1556.08 - sibo which our primary option Exchange
1558.44 - is because everybody has certain
1560.48 - benefits there are great products at
1562.32 - both exchanges everybody has different
1564.08 - benefits in the case of Futures options
1566.60 - it's about Capital efficiency you can
1568.48 - see here for the same amount of money
1571.00 - you can make almost seven times as much
1574.00 - money so for the same $7,000 putting up
1577.48 - you know 52 days in the Spire or 63 days
1580.04 - in the es there is 226 in Max profit
1583.32 - vers $1,400 in Max profit that's one of
1585.88 - the advantage of understanding Capital
1587.44 - efficiency the are the same products
1589.28 - does that mean we only trade es options
1591.00 - of course not we trade spy all the time
1592.96 - for lots of different reasons but I'm
1595.36 - just showing you that is what we call
1597.08 - Nuance knowhow that is understanding
1599.76 - that your max profit could be as much as
1601.44 - six times greater that's what we talk
1602.96 - about with capital efficiency let's go
1605.16 - to next slide oops sorry here we go
1609.80 - so I call this do the right thing and do
1613.28 - the right thing is understanding that
1617.20 - sometimes the stock
1619.04 - wins sometimes you do everything right
1622.64 - everything freaking right you did you
1624.96 - made the right adjustments you rolled
1626.24 - out at all the right times you
1627.72 - neutralize your Delta and you know what
1629.76 - that damn stock won that damn future won
1633.12 - that commodity won you know what that
1635.52 - ETF one that index one sometimes they
1637.68 - win they gotta win everybody's got to
1640.28 - get their wins in there okay you have to
1643.32 - do the right thing you have to make the
1645.20 - painful defensive individual Delta
1648.40 - adjustments I I think I know better than
1650.52 - anybody when I'm short something and a
1652.20 - Stock's going up for me to make a
1654.56 - defensive Delta adjustment which means
1657.32 - which means to roll up puts is painful
1661.36 - but I've done it enough times to know
1663.92 - hey that is just the nature of this game
1667.16 - do not be afraid on the other hand to
1669.72 - make offensive adjustments you have a
1672.20 - good position on the IV rank is super
1674.88 - high you do not want to take the
1677.08 - position off you want to make an
1678.96 - offensive adjustment by for example
1681.24 - rolling down the calls you want to make
1683.28 - an offensive adjustment by rolling out
1685.44 - to the next month and keeping the
1686.52 - position on there is absolutely on a
1689.40 - position that you have going your way
1690.92 - there is absolutely nothing wrong with
1693.04 - making an offensive
1694.64 - adjustment now here's the key to this
1697.60 - though be careful when trying to hedge
1700.16 - because most people don't realize this
1703.08 - and people get really confused by the
1704.56 - term hedge hedging is extremely
1707.12 - difficult HED hedging is something I
1709.12 - rarely talk about because hedging you
1711.80 - pay a massive premium for hedging
1714.56 - hedging is like an insurance policy and
1716.72 - you pay a very rich premium for
1718.84 - insurance which doesn't come into play
1720.80 - very often so be careful be conservative
1724.16 - about your Hedges if you're hedging
1725.80 - something offensively go for it I'm
1728.36 - totally fine with that but if you're
1729.68 - hedging something defensively be careful
1732.68 - okay because you're probably going to
1734.00 - overpay so again just a quick little
1736.08 - reminder here sometimes a stock wins
1738.28 - just get that through your head make the
1740.32 - painful defensive individual Delta
1742.72 - adjustments it's something every Trader
1744.84 - has to do don't be afraid to make
1747.36 - offensive adjustments when you feel like
1749.16 - hey you're in a strong position and the
1751.36 - position is going your way and be
1753.16 - careful when trying to hedge be
1754.80 - reluctant to hedge unless you really
1756.60 - need to all right the next segment and
1759.56 - I'm moving along at a fast pace and I
1761.52 - hope you all are enjoying this I hope
1763.16 - you're all getting a lot out of this
1764.64 - like I said I just finished writing this
1766.40 - this past weekend so none of this I've
1768.28 - ever covered before in this kind of a
1769.64 - webinar so it's all new and I think it's
1771.60 - going to be really valuable and then
1773.40 - we're doing the bigger series all about
1775.40 - this I'm calling this segment closing
1777.84 - and rolling so when you have a position
1779.72 - on and you're trying to decide should I
1781.52 - close the position should I roll the
1783.32 - position should I roll it out to the
1784.88 - next month or should I close it what do
1786.64 - I do at 21dt what what what what what
1789.12 - what what what what what do I do closing
1791.52 - and
1792.56 - rolling okay so first of all why close a
1795.64 - position so let's say you're at the
1798.44 - optimal point in the Decay curve which
1800.68 - means you have all the factors working
1802.64 - for you that's why you close let's say
1805.56 - you've made the most on a daily basis of
1808.80 - what you can make and now the risk
1810.60 - reward is going to flip-flop a little
1813.24 - bit and you're going to take more risk
1814.80 - for Less reward why close the implied
1818.56 - volatility rank which when you put the
1820.64 - position on was quite high is now low
1823.60 - because the ibr has dropped because the
1825.84 - underlying has either moved or it did
1827.36 - what was going to do or had its earnings
1829.00 - whatever it was so the ivr's dro so it's
1831.04 - no longer an attractive
1832.60 - play why close it's a better use of
1836.12 - capital to redeploy it somewhere else
1839.24 - because for whatever reason it's just an
1840.80 - inefficient use of capital for example
1843.12 - I'm using spy now I can use es or Mees
1845.76 - whatever it is or I'm using Uso now I
1848.20 - can use CL for options there's just a
1850.52 - better use of capital somewhere else or
1852.04 - it's a different underlying altogether
1853.60 - I'm using CL options I want to go to
1855.20 - natural gas I'm using Bond options I
1857.68 - want to go to notes I'm using IBM
1860.28 - options I want to go to Qualcomm
1863.36 - whatever it
1864.60 - is and then lastly why close because the
1867.84 - underlying is no longer part of your
1869.96 - current assumption you were bearish now
1872.04 - you're bullish you were bearish now
1873.88 - you're neutral you were bullish now
1876.04 - you're neutral okay so or or the
1879.00 - underlying has reached whatever your
1881.08 - target was what is your target well it
1883.08 - should be at the expected move so when
1885.52 - you put a position on you know the
1886.76 - expected move is $10 if the underlying
1888.28 - move is $10 then you have to re-evaluate
1890.28 - hey went to the expected move I should
1892.20 - take my
1893.92 - profits so the next piece I wrote was
1896.80 - about why roll give yourself time to be
1900.60 - right that's why we roll we extend
1903.12 - duration we're always right but
1905.60 - sometimes we're like super early like
1908.28 - years days months weeks whatever it is
1911.88 - but you roll because you give yourself
1913.52 - time to be right we call that extending
1915.60 - duration rolling is the strong
1918.48 - defense without adding more Capital to a
1921.72 - position rolling reduces your risk buys
1925.68 - time and and doesn't require that you
1928.44 - add more Capital that's why you roll we
1931.20 - also roll because it reduces the
1933.24 - volatility of your portfolio by as much
1935.24 - as a third so when your portfolio let's
1937.64 - say has a $100 of risk a day if you roll
1940.08 - forward you reduce that risk because
1941.80 - you're adding duration by as much as $30
1945.04 - or as much as
1946.52 - 30% and then rolling and this is the
1949.24 - real key here it virtually eliminates
1952.68 - all outlier risk can't eliminate you
1955.08 - know okay I'll take out the word
1956.92 - virtually it eliminates most of your
1959.12 - outlier risk in the case of the Spy
1961.64 - almost all of it but in the case of
1962.92 - individual equities a lot of it as you
1965.32 - can see here um when we we put a little
1969.72 - example at the bottom these are 20 Delta
1971.12 - strangles in the Spy the win rates are
1973.44 - about the same the wind rates never
1974.92 - change but the difference is that you
1977.88 - make more money and when you have 20
1981.60 - Delta strangles um well this actually
1983.80 - they didn't put that they didn't put
1984.92 - probably the best numbers in here for
1986.28 - you see but the the the the generally
1989.00 - speaking your outlier risk goes way down
1992.08 - you make more money your outlier risk
1993.72 - goes
1995.44 - down so does trade duration matter in
1999.88 - the process well for optimizing
2002.32 - mechanics the simple answer is yes for
2006.00 - theoretical Edge the answer there's no
2008.40 - so what does that mean does trade
2010.32 - duration matter and that means if you do
2013.44 - a trade that's one day out three days
2015.56 - out seven days out 14 days out 21 days
2017.88 - out or 45 days out there is no
2020.32 - difference in theoretical Edge you are
2022.44 - going to have the same the same let's
2024.88 - call it Penny round fair value in all
2027.16 - those cases there is no difference in
2028.92 - theoretical Edge the difference is with
2031.84 - optimization of mechanics the difference
2034.16 - is that you are at a better point in the
2036.72 - Decay curve when you give yourself
2039.28 - different levels of me of mechanics it's
2041.32 - very hard to manage a trade with one day
2043.92 - to go it's very hard to manage a trade
2046.72 - with one week to go it is a lot easier
2048.36 - to manage a trade with 45 days to go and
2050.52 - you live in a certain part of Decay
2051.80 - curve which is much more powerful for
2054.64 - you over
2056.24 - time also duration matters
2059.76 - because the Deltas move slower and hence
2063.84 - you have fewer adjustments when you have
2066.56 - longer durations when you have short
2068.32 - durations Delta moves really fast and
2070.40 - you have to make lots of different
2071.48 - changes when you move when you have
2073.48 - really longer durations Delta moves
2075.68 - really slow both your gamma risk and
2079.04 - your outlier risk are reduced I wouldn't
2081.96 - say they're reduced to nothing but
2083.40 - they're down they're they become minimal
2086.20 - if you if you add duration and then
2088.20 - adding duration this is a cool thing
2089.92 - adding duration synthetically increases
2093.08 - implied volatility in the longer dated
2094.80 - months so if you're looking around and
2096.32 - all the implied volatility underly
2097.76 - really want to trade is low you add
2099.60 - duration to it and it synthetically
2101.48 - increases the implied
2103.24 - volatility it's kind of crazy but that's
2105.20 - just the way the modeling works because
2106.80 - nobody knows what's going to happen in
2107.88 - the long term so those options will have
2109.52 - a tendency to stay higher and if you
2111.08 - look on the right hand side of the pat
2112.24 - here you can see with the 16 Delta put
2113.68 - 53 days to go the gamma is
2116.52 - 0.93 and then the gamma risk goes up by
2119.52 - 5x when you go down to three three days
2121.84 - to go so there's five times less gamma
2125.24 - risk in from you know from 3 days to 53
2129.12 - days and that's just the whole argument
2131.16 - here you don't have to do everything at
2132.52 - 45 or 50 or 60 or 30 or 40 days whatever
2135.72 - it is but just understanding that having
2138.36 - a diversified portfolio of underlyings
2140.60 - if you're trying to manage your
2141.56 - portfolio you're trying to manage all
2143.12 - positions with with one three and 7-Day
2145.40 - risk man you're in for a you are not in
2148.24 - for this that's no party but if you are
2150.56 - managing positions that are all over the
2152.40 - place you could have a three day you
2153.36 - could have a 7day you could have a 21
2154.56 - day you could have a bunch of 45 days
2156.36 - it's a lot easier to manage those
2160.80 - positions and then how critical is
2164.04 - timing because we know we can't time
2166.44 - what the Market's going to do so what is
2169.36 - what part of timing is critical well
2173.20 - you're attention to what you're doing
2176.64 - that's that timing piece is critical
2179.48 - your mechanics your timing with respect
2181.60 - to your mechanics that's critical what
2184.60 - what you what you can't do is time the
2187.16 - market
2188.12 - what you can do is time the amount of
2190.80 - attention you spend on something and
2192.72 - time the amount of attention you spend
2195.00 - to the
2196.56 - mechanics timing is synonymous with risk
2199.84 - reduction discipline because if you if
2203.36 - you want to be that risk disciplined
2207.08 - person okay then you have to have this
2209.72 - sense of timing attention to all that
2212.68 - stuff timing contributes to longevity
2216.60 - this is kind of a cool thing timing
2218.36 - contributes to longevity and Longevity
2221.24 - is the largest contributor to overall
2223.32 - success I do an entire um speech on this
2227.60 - which I love to give about
2229.00 - entrepreneurship there is a minuscule
2232.68 - difference between success on every
2236.04 - single level in every single industry
2238.08 - there is not a huge difference between
2240.56 - person number one on the on the depth
2243.16 - chart and person number 100 person
2245.92 - number 100 has a lot of C catching up to
2248.00 - do but most of it is based on your
2250.44 - ability to survive it's based on
2253.08 - longevity it's based on being able to
2255.68 - hang around for three four five decades
2257.88 - it's based on being able to there's
2259.68 - almost no such thing as overnight
2261.16 - success and trading is the same thing
2264.44 - trading success in the investment World
2266.64 - success in the trading world it's all
2268.92 - about longevity so you're your ability
2272.32 - to be attentive your ability to time the
2277.12 - amount time spent with respect to
2279.04 - mechanics your timing is synonymous with
2282.12 - risk reduction and success it's
2284.52 - synonymous with longevity and overall
2289.68 - success okay and I'm going to go into
2291.96 - the last piece here this is called
2294.68 - redeploying Capital so you have a
2297.04 - position on you have this entire
2298.88 - portfolio you've been managing you've
2300.84 - been doing everything you know we were
2302.36 - talking about it three different
2303.36 - sections you've been doing everything
2305.08 - according to the book man you're
2306.28 - mechanical as hell now and but now what
2308.96 - do you do what's the next step so how
2312.88 - active should you be meaning you know
2315.56 - like how aggressive should I be well be
2317.04 - as active as you like there's no such
2319.48 - thing as being too active or too
2321.40 - aggressive there is such thing as not
2324.36 - being active
2328.12 - enough but there's no such thing as
2330.48 - being too active or too aggressive is
2331.64 - there such thing as overtrading I don't
2333.28 - know maybe some people think I I'm I'm
2335.80 - an over Trader so it's hard for me to
2337.08 - agree with that but I'm also a very
2339.00 - aggressive Trader um so I like people
2342.00 - that are active and aggressive I'm fine
2343.72 - with it but some form of daily daily
2347.16 - engagement even if it's just a position
2349.56 - review some form of daily engagement
2351.72 - where it's just like hey you know what
2353.72 - um I just G to check my positions you
2355.08 - don't even have to make a trade but just
2357.40 - hey I'm gonna check my Deltas I'm gonna
2358.80 - check my p&l I'm gonna check my
2360.92 - portfolio Theta I'm going to check my
2362.52 - portfolio p&l all right what's going on
2365.08 - today why am I losing this much money
2366.60 - why am I making this much money what's
2367.96 - going on I'm just going to check the
2369.04 - Futures really quick you know what some
2371.04 - form of daily engagement I don't care
2372.84 - where you are in the world there's
2374.20 - nowhere you can be in the world today
2376.72 - where you can't do this I mean maybe I
2379.12 - don't know maybe on top of some Mountain
2380.84 - somewhere who knows but for the most
2382.32 - part there's almost nowhere you can pay
2385.00 - and then monetary markets or just
2388.12 - talking shop is really valuable one of
2390.56 - the reasons that we do Live Events one
2392.40 - of the reasons we do this kind of event
2393.72 - one of the reasons we have chats one of
2394.92 - the reasons we do all this interaction
2397.40 - on our Network and everything else is
2399.08 - because trading can be very lonely when
2401.00 - you're sitting in a room by yourself or
2402.12 - you're not around other people and all
2403.08 - this kind of stuff and investing is the
2404.64 - same thing being able to talk shop at
2407.80 - one of our Live Events or doing
2409.04 - something like that is incredibly
2410.60 - valuable being able to articulate your
2412.92 - thoughts about trading being able to
2415.20 - talk to somebody else about markets I do
2417.44 - it all day long I mean I've been doing
2420.00 - it all day long my whole life so it
2421.64 - seems like that's all I have to you know
2424.84 - at the Thanksgiving table we always or
2427.20 - at at some holiday table at my house
2429.20 - it's not a question of let's you know
2432.44 - don't don't read your phone or don't
2434.16 - watch TV it's always like hey no talk no
2437.08 - Market talk today that's how that's how
2440.12 - wacky my family is and then remember and
2443.44 - this is so important for me Product
2445.92 - indifference and capital efficiency
2448.20 - allow for more activity if you're all
2450.64 - locked up in equities there's you're
2452.68 - trapped like a rat if you're all in
2454.56 - certain Commodities you're tra you you
2456.32 - need to be in in products that are in
2460.12 - you need to be in products that are some
2461.96 - are capital efficient more Capital
2463.16 - efficient than others you need to be in
2464.76 - different true product the great thing
2467.24 - about Futures and Futures options is
2469.76 - they are almost all not correlated to
2472.16 - equities except the except the indexes
2474.56 - they're almost all not correlated that
2476.56 - gives you all these other choices and
2477.92 - all of them are capital efficient so
2481.32 - again in your head be agnostic be
2485.04 - product agnostic be product IND
2487.88 - be
2488.60 - strategically indifferent be Capital
2491.68 - efficient all of those allow for more
2497.76 - activity this is a um correlation graph
2502.04 - and I put spy Q's iwm TLT gldd Uso un
2508.24 - and fxc all of these have an underlying
2511.04 - Futures product spy is es Q's is NQ iwm
2515.76 - is rty CLT is uh ZB GLD GLD is GC Uso is
2522.44 - is CL un is NG and fxe is 6E okay they
2527.92 - all have a Futures equivalent and
2530.68 - they're all the exact same these are the
2532.68 - these are the ETFs that we use and you
2535.04 - can look on here and you can see that
2536.84 - when you go to the bottom of the page
2538.16 - and you take a look at um remember the
2540.28 - Spy is the is the one across the board
2542.64 - and you look at bonds and gold and Uso
2545.36 - and and un you you'll see that there's
2548.60 - virtually no
2551.48 - correlation fascinating when you start
2553.28 - to look at all this stuff and you see
2554.52 - kind of the the beauty of
2556.64 - non-correlation or uncorrelated
2560.88 - markets so how important is redeploying
2564.76 - your capital and the number of
2566.00 - occurrences well in order for this stuff
2569.16 - everything we're talking about today to
2570.92 - be worthwhile for you in order for
2572.56 - everything that we're doing here to make
2574.76 - sense for you in the long run in order
2576.92 - for to work in order for you to have
2579.96 - some form of predictable outcome you
2582.88 - have to have a reasonable number of
2584.48 - occurrences so increasing the number of
2586.92 - occurrences the number of stuff you do
2588.16 - something whether you just log on
2590.16 - whether you adjust a position whether
2591.52 - you close something or reopen whatever
2593.08 - it is the more occurrences you have to a
2596.20 - reasonable number will allow for more
2597.84 - predictable outcomes redeploying Capital
2601.16 - taking your position redeploying the
2602.68 - capital keeps your Capital
2605.04 - optimized so again basis reduction high
2609.32 - pop are the foundations of a successful
2612.20 - portfolio that allow you to redeploy
2614.72 - your Capital which optimizes your
2616.40 - Capital which makes your results much
2618.64 - more predictable what you see on the
2620.92 - right hand side of the page is what
2623.40 - happens when you create lots of outcomes
2626.48 - when you only have a couple you can see
2628.24 - at the bottom say number of Trades
2629.76 - sampled when you only have between zero
2631.64 - and 200 there's lots of there's girth
2634.56 - there there's lots of width when you
2636.12 - start to get down between five 600 800
2639.56 - or 1,000 trades everything starts to
2641.72 - narrow and there's very little outlier
2643.20 - moves when you get even more than that
2645.36 - 2,000 to 5,000 trades it becomes a very
2648.00 - narrow line that's what this is all
2651.52 - about creating a currenc allows for a
2654.88 - more predictable outcome redeploying
2657.24 - capital and keeping your Capital
2658.20 - optimized gives you the capital to do
2659.68 - what you need to do and then again it's
2661.92 - all about basis reduction and high
2665.60 - pop so
2667.56 - what are some reasonable return
2669.92 - expectations because everybody asks me
2671.96 - this all the time so on your portfolio
2674.92 - what should you be what's your objective
2677.16 - so the minimum objective in my opinion
2679.88 - should be three
2681.60 - times um risk- free rates risk-free
2684.40 - rates right now are about 5% you are not
2687.00 - going to do all this work for 6% or for
2690.00 - 7% or for 8% in my mind with the amount
2693.92 - of work that it takes the resources and
2695.80 - everything else your OB objective
2697.40 - doesn't mean you have to hit it but your
2699.36 - objective could be 7x could be 35% okay
2703.40 - could be 3% a month if you have a
2705.24 - smaller account it's easier to hit
2706.48 - higher numbers but my point is I don't
2709.08 - care what it is what the max is I care
2711.64 - what the Min is and the minimum of your
2714.32 - objective should be around three times
2716.08 - the risk-free rates so we're talking
2718.20 - let's call it wrapped right around 15
2720.60 - 18% on the minimum side because that
2722.72 - makes all this worth
2724.28 - it you should average a approximately
2727.64 - 25% of your daily Theta keeping it so if
2731.80 - your daily Theta let's give it back to
2733.56 - that example I used earlier which was
2735.72 - let's say you had a $100,000 account you
2737.40 - had Thea which you collected $200 a day
2740.24 - which is 210 of 1% and let's say there's
2743.00 - 30 days in a month okay so you collect
2745.48 - $6,000 of theta then in that case in
2749.08 - $6,000 of theta you're keeping 25% of it
2751.40 - which is $1,500 you then take your
2754.56 - $1,500 okay and you look at that and you
2757.00 - say okay what is that on a monthly
2758.32 - return well lo and behold that's 1.5%
2760.88 - that's 18% annualized just exactly where
2763.52 - this is see how beautiful that works how
2765.72 - the numbers work
2767.48 - out this should
2769.80 - significantly if you understand the math
2773.00 - and the objective here if you understand
2775.20 - what managing a portfolio is and
2776.56 - sticking to the mechanics and being
2778.44 - disciplined and doing some things that
2780.40 - sometimes are counterintuitive but they
2781.92 - stick to your discipline and trusting
2784.64 - the research and honoring that research
2787.68 - you should significantly improve all
2790.00 - other aspects of investing that means
2792.36 - even for non-traditional Investments and
2794.96 - all their aspects of risk-taking and or
2796.92 - business entrepreneurship businesses a
2798.92 - lot of you own your own businesses risk
2800.52 - taking and everything else like there
2802.72 - should be 50,000 people 100,000 people
2805.28 - listening to this discussion today
2806.80 - because this is the kind of thing that
2808.48 - changes lives this is the kind of thing
2810.48 - that makes a difference in everything
2812.48 - else that you do just understanding you
2814.44 - know what is a reasonable objective
2816.60 - what's the minimum objective how high
2818.60 - could I shoot for what is a reasonable
2820.56 - amount of money to keep based on the
2822.20 - risk that I'm taking and how much will
2824.64 - this impact everything else I do it
2826.00 - could be as much as 10x look at me I I
2829.04 - thought I was
2830.28 - done once you prove concept and you
2833.88 - prove
2835.36 - repeatability what I'm talking about
2837.44 - today here is very scalable that goes
2839.40 - back to that whole longevity thing
2840.72 - forgot about how important this slide is
2843.24 - how scalable is trading an active
2845.04 - portfolio well you need to prove concept
2848.72 - before you scale up you need to prove
2850.68 - concept you need to prove that you can
2852.76 - repeat this then it is very scalable the
2856.28 - general rule of thumb is scaling
2858.80 - Investments is about 10x the
2862.36 - speed of wealth
2865.12 - creation I know that sounds like just
2867.20 - think about it but I wrote this we we
2869.92 - try we've kind of tried to come up with
2871.60 - a model but as a general rule of thumb
2874.92 - scaling Investments is about about 10
2877.28 - times the speed of wealth creation
2879.32 - wealth creation takes a really long time
2881.96 - if you learn how to scale you can speed
2884.84 - that up 10x there's a lot of studies on
2887.32 - this not just done by us but there's
2888.96 - some University of Chicago studies
2890.36 - there's lots of studies about about you
2893.16 - know studies on kind of economic
2895.28 - Foundation economic bias and all this
2896.96 - kind of stuff and about basically how
2899.76 - how scaling Investments improves the
2903.68 - speed of wealth creation which is all
2905.20 - what this is about but again first you
2907.60 - have to prove concept first you have to
2909.64 - prove prove repeatability then it
2912.64 - becomes scalable and then you take
2914.44 - things to another level
