0.08 - currency gains Market pains we we never
3.96 - cover currencies either at our um uh
7.80 - during our Market measures so this is a
9.68 - fun but here is the thing that they were
11.96 - going for traditionally Traders believe
14.08 - that a strong currency would have a
17.08 - negative impact on the stock market
18.80 - which is obviously not has not really
20.68 - been the case because the US dollar has
22.92 - been super strong and the stock markets
24.40 - just off of record highs so the
27.20 - correlation between the you between the
29.48 - US Stock market and US currency has not
33.08 - been um inversely or positively
36.28 - correlated it's basically been it hasn't
37.96 - been much of anything over time it's
40.32 - really been no correlation that's why we
42.48 - look at at currency plays as being very
45.36 - indifferent I like currency plays
47.48 - because they're some they're they're
49.08 - just a different type of trade to have
50.52 - on um so far they haven't worked if
53.20 - you've been short short dollars and I've
55.84 - pretty much been short dollars which
56.96 - means I'm L on the currencies yes yes so
61.00 - what we're trying to say here is that if
63.56 - the US Dollar's value is rising the
65.56 - stock market generally expected to Trend
67.64 - downward and that hasn't been the case
69.32 - until the last three
70.76 - days um but let's see let's see what's
75.20 - really happened over the last X number
78.32 - of years let's go next slide I don't
80.08 - know how many years they're doing here
81.16 - total so first a little macro background
84.84 - a strong dollar combined with high
86.28 - interest rates could potentially slow
87.64 - economic
88.56 - growth um concerns about the Slowdown
91.04 - can lead to reduced investor confidence
94.60 - reduced competitivness of companies with
97.96 - global exposure sure because everything
99.60 - costs more in the US um a strong dollar
103.60 - means that foreign revenues translate
105.80 - into fewer dollars which can reduce
107.68 - overall reported earnings and the
110.12 - investment yield shift Capital may be
111.88 - attracted to the bond markets or to
113.88 - other high yield investment vehicles
115.60 - instead of equities due to the high
117.52 - yields available in the debt Market all
119.28 - these things are reasons why you know
121.64 - reasons to invest in anything but the
123.68 - underlying stock hence lower stock
126.36 - prices strong dollar lower stock price
128.68 - that's always what's what thought what's
130.24 - been thought let's go next slide we I've
133.16 - always treated these as two very
135.52 - independent you know non-correlated
137.96 - assets but currently the US dollar is at
140.96 - its strongest point of the last two
142.52 - decades it's nearing its highest level
145.16 - against the Yen it's reached its second
146.60 - highest level against the Euro surpassed
149.12 - only by levels in September of last year
152.08 - but as you can see the Euro's basically
154.72 - close to 100 and the yen is is wherever
158.72 - the end is now 64 63 so here are some
162.28 - relevant facts interest rates not only
165.00 - is the dollar strong but the US Treasury
167.32 - yield has reached its highest level
169.12 - since 2007 higher than in most developed
173.40 - countries and we put it up on the screen
175.36 - for you us interest rates are this is
177.56 - the 10-year of 4.5 s and then down the
181.24 - road you can see all the other ones the
182.76 - the UK is very similar but the other
184.52 - countries are all much lower with Japan
186.64 - has been in that one that 1% range for
189.96 - forever we call this International
192.04 - exposure this slide so foreign revenues
193.72 - make up 28% of the S&P 500's total
196.64 - revenues more than 3,000 us companies
199.84 - engage in foreign production including
202.64 - 99 of the nation's 100 largest
206.28 - industrial corporations America's
208.40 - largest P public company generate 41% of
211.12 - their revenue outside of the US and many
213.36 - large scale multinational corporations
216.08 - have more than half their sales outside
217.80 - the US for example Intel generates 78%
222.00 - of its sales internationally by
223.92 - Coca-Cola while Coca-Cola is 68% do you
226.52 - know what tasty is O I do not know
229.68 - Traders trading from all around the
231.32 - world using tasty trade generate around
235.08 - 20 I think it's around 22% of our
237.52 - Revenue wow maybe 23 % something like
240.60 - that but it's a bigger number than I
242.20 - thought yeah me too so given this
244.24 - logical framework we wanted to analyze
246.36 - whether the market supports the theory
248.72 - that a strong dollar negatively impacts
251.16 - stocks so to explore this we track the
254.60 - US dollar Index USDX which is calculated
258.44 - based on the exchange rates between the
259.88 - US dollar and a basket of six major
261.80 - currencies and you can see we put the
263.52 - waiting um to the the now s off if if
266.84 - that question was given to you prior to
269.92 - this year I I mean I I would have said
273.56 - yeah for sure a strong dollar is bad for
275.64 - the market would you would you agree yes
277.52 - I would have agreed but not prior to
279.16 - this year prior to the last couple years
281.36 - yeah yeah right yep absolutely so we
284.16 - look at this here's the long-term
286.00 - correlation between the S&P this is
288.08 - longterm and the US dollar which is
291.00 - point which is negative
293.24 - .17 so that is a nothing correlation now
298.84 - we've known this for at Tasty we've
301.16 - known this because we've talked about
303.08 - the positions in in um currencies being
306.80 - non-correlated so this is not like a
309.12 - surprise to us but right negative .17 is
313.20 - no correlation at all that's the S&P to
316.08 - the US dollar rolling three-month
317.76 - correlation now we're going to examine
319.92 - the five strongest and five weakest
321.96 - years for the dollar to determin whether
324.08 - its value significantly impacts the
325.68 - stock market in extreme environments
328.96 - going all the way back to 1990 it's a
331.40 - pretty extensive study so in the
333.84 - strongest years for the dollar the daily
335.76 - correlation with market performance is
338.08 - weak contrary to Theory the market is
340.88 - more likely to see positive returns with
344.32 - a strong dollar than it is negative
348.08 - returns like look at you know 97 2005
351.92 - 2014
353.52 - 1992 and you know you can even argue
356.20 - 2000 it's nothing but I guess my point
359.00 - here is is that the correlation in all
361.60 - these cases is negligible it's almost
364.48 - nothing so you're talking about a
365.84 - nothing correlation dollar up stock
368.32 - market up right right in the weakest
371.76 - years for the dollar the correlation is
373.16 - slightly stronger but still weak to
374.64 - moderate combined with the previous
376.32 - analysis there's no strong pattern
378.36 - between dollar value and stock market
380.72 - performance over the long term stock
382.76 - market just goes up all the time S&P is
384.40 - up you know whatever but the US dollar
386.92 - down US dollar down US dollar down US
388.68 - dollar down us down in all those in all
391.04 - those examples and the stock market's up
393.04 - in well it's up in two of those cases
395.32 - and and the correlation is still 0. 2
397.00 - or3 it's not it's nothing yeah that's
399.36 - what I need this year is the US dollar
401.04 - down 16% and the stock market unchanged
403.64 - make that happen please do my best for
406.48 - you I'll do your at least for a day or
408.48 - two give you a chance so the takeaway is
410.88 - from this traditional beliefs that the
412.84 - US Dollar's value should negatively
415.08 - impact the overall Market is outdated
418.48 - because we have looked at the best five
421.12 - years and the worst five years for the
422.76 - US dollar and the correlation is
426.80 - negligible and the the stock market's um
431.68 - returns are also mixed and completely
435.00 - random so however the evidence shows a
437.04 - weak correlation between them over the
439.24 - long term and that is correct there is a
442.08 - very weak correlation between the US
444.16 - dollar and stock market returns and
446.96 - those returns are so random that there's
449.32 - no no possible takeaway that we could
451.08 - say that if the US dollar actually
452.72 - starts to sell off that the that that
455.20 - currencies are going to go significantly
456.96 - higher I I'm sorry the stock market's
458.56 - gonna go higher or lower can't make
460.64 - can't make an assumption one way or the
461.84 - other correct yes exactly
