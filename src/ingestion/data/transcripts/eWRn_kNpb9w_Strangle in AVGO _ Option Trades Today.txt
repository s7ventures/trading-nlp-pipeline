0.16 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.24 - the B Batista and I have a trade idea
3.72 - for you today October 15th 2024 and I'm
7.80 - right here in downtown Chicago right
9.48 - here in the Batcave but like I always do
11.96 - let's take a look at the market see
13.20 - what's going on before we find this
14.52 - trade even the S&P is down
17.68 - $19.50 you can see they're about $10 10
20.56 - handles or 10 points off of their lows
24.84 - well off of their highs obviously NASDAQ
26.88 - down 200 and you got the Dow down19
30.16 - those are the three indices that are
31.28 - down you can see the NASDAQ is the
33.16 - weakest of the group and you've got the
34.80 - Russell up 11 bucking it to the upside
38.92 - volatility up 45 cents just off of his
41.80 - highs of 1910 uh by about 1520 cents
45.56 - volatility creeping and staying bid
47.64 - maybe it's the election season maybe
50.00 - volatility is percolating because the
51.40 - Market's gotten a little bit too frothy
53.68 - let's take a look at what's going on for
55.04 - the next couple of days and see what
56.36 - happens bonds finally catch a bid
58.16 - they're up 105 good volatility in the
61.00 - bonds if you're looking to do something
62.56 - and selling premium uh in there what am
65.24 - I going to look at today well like I
67.12 - always do or like I usually do I like to
69.36 - go to the ivx 5day change what is this
72.60 - you ask I'm glad you asked this is the
75.60 - volatility of each product's net change
79.76 - over the last 5 days meaning their
82.12 - implied volatility so you'll notice spy
85.24 - has an IV rank it's implied volatility
88.24 - it's monthly implied volatility that
90.48 - would be this number right here in the
93.68 - uh right hand side this number when
96.24 - compared to itself gives you a little
98.72 - bit of a rank let's go back to spy from
101.24 - a scale of 1 to 100 this volatility in
104.48 - spy being around well let's just call it
107.24 - uh 18
108.48 - 1920 uh is about on a scale of 0 to 100
112.80 - about the 35 percentile meaning uh good
116.88 - high not the best at least in this kind
120.08 - of Market environment you'll notice here
121.88 - there are many stocks that have higher
123.28 - implied volatility many of them are
125.76 - going to have earnings looming I like to
128.96 - get rid of the earnings and not see that
131.48 - a stock that I found and just to save
133.36 - you from dragging along avgo when I go
137.44 - down here to the bottom the very very
140.16 - bottom has
141.88 - earnings coming but not until after
145.36 - expiration you'll see them here on Def
148.32 - December 5th you'll notice here that
151.24 - avgo its IV rank is 44 higher than the
155.52 - market I'm talking about spy and then
158.64 - the ivx 5day change is actually up 1%
162.80 - over the last 5 days when volatility has
165.96 - been going lower as of late when you
168.08 - look at the volatility overall Market
169.84 - you can see over the last 5 days even
172.04 - though it's catching a bid today it's
173.88 - been going lower so let's take a look at
176.28 - avgo if you want to you know it as
179.08 - broadcom I know it is avgo it's had its
182.16 - first down tick today down around $7 and
185.24 - change and you can notice here uh
187.84 - volatility again creeping up just
189.76 - another way to look at it you can get
191.60 - this on your own uh platform on tasty
194.44 - trade uh by going into the uh settings
197.24 - and changing to the ivr high low that's
200.36 - what I have there the high being 47 for
202.76 - the day the low being 41 presently it's
205.96 - 44 let's take a look at avj avgo and
209.40 - what we're going to do here I'm going to
210.68 - play this straight by the numbers now
212.20 - November 31 days we like to go 45 days
216.24 - to expiration that's the kind of the
218.36 - optimal time frame you might say well
220.28 - there's options with 45 days and has
222.68 - earnings on December 5th that's that
224.60 - line This is November 29th options why
227.48 - don't we go to these well when you go to
229.28 - these you'll notice that there's markets
230.92 - are 20 cents wide 30 cents wide not a
234.16 - lot of volume when you look at the uh
236.40 - not a lot of open interest on these
238.44 - options I like to trade things that have
240.64 - a higher uh open interest a much better
243.80 - bid ask Market let's see in avgo what it
246.76 - would be like in November because I
248.52 - can't trade December you know what with
250.44 - 45 days to go um December's on the board
254.08 - for me November's still on the board but
256.64 - a year about a day or two away from
258.64 - going off the board in November so I'm
260.56 - going to put this trade in November for
262.40 - today another interesting thing I saw
264.72 - November has a 45% monthly implied
268.60 - volatility December which would be
271.44 - affected by the earnings the December
273.20 - 20th options with earnings coming on
275.20 - December 5th has a 46 and a half
278.88 - 46.7% uh monthly imply volatility all
282.00 - things being equal with no earnings risk
284.16 - this volatility is elevated in November
286.60 - at least when I compare it to December
288.68 - and an earnings event give me more and
290.40 - more reason why I wanted to stay in
292.56 - November well because I'm not having
295.76 - time on my side that's almost like a
297.40 - double negative but since I don't have
299.08 - time on my side 31 days usually these
302.44 - positions Take 2 to 3 weeks to come to
304.76 - fruition meaning making 25 to 50% uh on
308.48 - the on the overall spread I'm going to
309.92 - go a little further out give myself a
311.64 - little bit more room to be right you'll
313.68 - notice here that the open interest is in
315.00 - the thousands across all the lines um in
318.84 - avgo much better than what we saw with
321.08 - the 45 days so I'm going to go to the
323.24 - 152 puts that's basically a standard
326.52 - deviation that line right here is a
328.56 - standard Dev Dev ation or you can go to
331.36 - the Delta the Delta's you know between
333.52 - 13 and 15 is a standard deviation I'm
336.12 - going to sell the 152 puts just going
338.64 - right to the math model just going to
340.40 - the standard deviation here I'm going to
342.24 - go up to that line I'm going to the
345.88 - 198 call I'm doing this whole spread wow
349.32 - it's already moved pretty good I did it
351.24 - for
353.12 - $355 uh maybe if you had the tasty trade
357.20 - platform and you had been watching you
359.44 - can you go down to the follow page and
361.32 - you'll notice I have this trade already
363.64 - in here I'm going to go to Bob the
365.28 - trader because that's me I did this at
367.36 - 10:13 uh when the stock was right here
369.64 - it really hasn't moved uh the ivr has
371.92 - moved down by only a point but yet it's
374.08 - moved this spread significantly I did
376.44 - this spread at
377.40 - $3.55 and I'm explaining to you here
379.72 - that it's just a strangle at one
381.36 - standard deviation but maybe volatility
383.64 - expand a little bit in here where the
385.48 - stock will move a little bit and you'll
386.68 - be able to get filled at a similar price
388.76 - anyway three
390.28 - $55 for me let's take a look at this
392.76 - overall trade it has a good pop of
395.96 - 75% my Theta Decay for the risk I'm
398.84 - taking now this is in an IRA account I
401.20 - wanted to to show you that an IRA
403.64 - account you could do this type of trade
405.36 - even though it's going to use
406.32 - significantly more buying power
409.00 - $155,000 now in a margin account it's
411.88 - going to use significantly less probably
413.88 - closer to
414.92 - $22,000 in a margin account but yes in
418.24 - tasty trade you can do this trade you
421.16 - can have a naked call option as long as
423.92 - you have the buying power which is
426.00 - basically fully margined at $155,000
429.16 - again if you're in a margin account
431.12 - it'll be significantly less more like
433.12 - one10 the size let's call it $2500 to
436.44 - $3,000 in buying power $16 in Theta
440.20 - Decay it has a little bit of short Delta
442.40 - 5 because I went to the one standard
444.60 - deviation I did not and you could if you
447.16 - wanted to go to the same uh delta
450.04 - neutral type tra trade go up to the 200
452.60 - or the 205 I'm sticking with the 198s
456.12 - I'm just going with that one standard
458.00 - deviation on the overall Market plus
460.20 - with volatility percolating a little bit
462.08 - and the stock taking a little bit of a
463.32 - breather to the downside today I think
465.40 - it's nice to stay at that one standard
467.68 - deviation you'll notice here that this
470.12 - line this uh brownish line is the
474.04 - expected move the expected move so I'm
476.80 - outside well outside the expected move
478.84 - to one standard deviation I got filled
481.00 - at
481.80 - $3.55 it looks like it's
485.28 - $347 right now I wouldn't press this
487.96 - trade I would wait for volatility to
489.44 - expand in avgo there are good markets in
492.56 - avgo and has good implied volatility
494.88 - matter of fact let's see if uh it's
496.48 - changed at all down here no it's still
498.40 - 1% uh move in avgo all right that's my
502.24 - trade for you guys today be careful out
