0.12 - how best can we hedge against a Black
1.72 - Swan event this is the age-old question
4.04 - I mean I think if you stick to the
5.56 - mechanics being in positions with 45
8.00 - days on Entry closing around 21 days or
10.32 - rolling around 21 days giving yourself
12.48 - time to be right there's one way to
14.24 - hedge and that's to stay small that's it
16.44 - there's no way to get short enough Delta
19.24 - there's no way to have enough puts
21.36 - there's no way to know when to get out
22.64 - of that stuff so the answer is Tony's
24.84 - right there's nothing you can do to
27.04 - hedge against the Black Swan event that
28.96 - doesn't even exist anybody that thinks
30.72 - that that exists it's just you're living
32.48 - in la la land it does not exist but if
34.88 - you keep your position size small you're
36.68 - hedging against a black SW event
