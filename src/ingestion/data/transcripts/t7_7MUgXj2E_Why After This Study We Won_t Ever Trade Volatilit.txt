0.32 - separating reality from
3.36 - Fear fix expansion separating reality
6.28 - from Fear so selling premium and high
8.40 - implied volatility is ideal because the
10.56 - trader will likely benefit from a
12.16 - volatility contraction volatility as we
14.96 - talked about yesterday and many other
16.84 - times is mean reverting so when it goes
20.12 - up it's at some point it's going to come
23.32 - down sometimes it stays high for a long
25.80 - time like 2008 to 2009 stayed high for
29.36 - almost I want to
31.92 - say almost two 300 days or something but
35.88 - usually it's five or six days and
39.56 - volatility goes gets high and then it
42.04 - contracts but when selling low
43.84 - volatility there's the risk of implied
46.08 - volatility
47.64 - expansion that's volatility going up how
50.88 - serious has this risk been over time
54.40 - because we know that volatility goes up
56.56 - um I mean we know when volatility goes
58.44 - up it goes up really fast and we know
60.80 - when it comes down it's like H it could
62.96 - be torture sometimes but sure how much
65.64 - of a risk is volatility exploding what
67.76 - do you think let's go to next slide and
69.52 - we'll give tony some more I don't know I
70.80 - got a percentage let's give let's give
72.36 - him some I'm gonna give him some more
73.84 - information before I ask cont y so we're
77.12 - going to look at the Spy we're going to
78.40 - look at Tesla the reason we chose Tesla
80.72 - is because of all the stocks that are
83.52 - out there um that's consistently been in
86.56 - the top of the um
90.96 - most actively traded ones like right now
93.40 - it probably be I think Nvidia is the
96.88 - most actively
98.28 - traded options you know um yeah it's
101.56 - always been the one with some of the
102.56 - most volume but Tesla's number two right
104.56 - now and Tesla's always been one or two I
106.84 - want to say for the last like five years
108.96 - so we're using spy and Tesla they've
110.48 - been one and two for the longest period
111.76 - of time we're selling 16 Delta triangle
114.68 - 45 days to expiration manag in 21 days
117.48 - and we compared
120.00 - when the vix range is when it's below 15
123.56 - between 15 and 30 which it is right now
127.40 - and then above 30 which it is a very
130.64 - small percent of the time in fact I want
132.16 - to say based on the research we did
133.72 - yesterday that I kind of remember that
135.56 - number to be like around 7% of the time
139.72 - I I don't know if that's right Tony but
141.04 - I think we're above 30 about 7% of the
143.24 - time we're between 15 and 30
147.92 - um we're between 15 and 30
151.68 - probably
153.44 - about about 40 to 50% of the time and
156.48 - then obviously the balance below 50 um
159.32 - yeah in the last calendar year from
161.24 - February to February it's probably even
163.20 - less than that it's only three or four
164.80 - times in the whole year yeah Beth
166.60 - there's a it says b o l o I'm sorry b o
171.04 - l w just change that to an E so we so we
173.92 - don't so we look perfect thank you let's
176.76 - go next
178.84 - slide so for example when the price of
181.88 - the Spy 16 Delta strangle will be higher
185.16 - when implied volatility is higher
186.76 - resulting in a loss seller okay
188.40 - obviously when when volatility goes up
190.60 - premium sellers lose money so implied
193.04 - volatility is 15% you collect 335 if
196.48 - it's 25% you collect um 505 and if it's
199.84 - 35% you collect 7 uh 35 so it's it's
203.16 - obviously when when volatility goes up
205.60 - proportionately the amount of Premium
207.80 - goes up the other thing is when you're
210.12 - selling 16 Delta strangles when
212.28 - volatility is cheap um you don't make a
214.88 - lot of money when volatility is
216.80 - expensive or at least higher you make
218.88 - money so that's the most important
221.16 - takeaway from this entire slide it's
223.72 - it's not it's that the return on
226.20 - investment is a negative number when
228.64 - volatility is low that's why we use IV
232.04 - rank to tell us when to get into
233.52 - positions and all that kind of stuff
235.28 - because we don't do well unless implied
238.00 - volatility is on the higher end of its
239.28 - range we're talking about IV this is
241.52 - we're talking about straight fix but but
244.00 - we use ivr to help us with individual
246.40 - stocks to put context around everything
248.56 - um you can see the higher the implied
250.84 - volatility the better that we do the
253.12 - buying power the probability of profit
255.08 - everything's going to be kind of the
256.24 - same um but we just the average p&l and
259.56 - the return on investment is better when
261.52 - volatility is higher let's go next
264.76 - slide so to put context around
267.04 - volatility expansion risk we examine the
268.96 - frequency at and the magnitude of
270.64 - expansions we recorded the vix on day 1
273.08 - and day 45 and computed the difference
275.40 - this was done every trading day since
277.92 - 2017 you can imagine the amount of data
280.36 - in here this is almost eight years worth
282.04 - of stuff let's go next
285.84 - slide so for spy in very low implied
289.56 - volatility 75% of the 45-day periods saw
293.08 - vix change of less than 3.7 points so it
296.88 - was fairly rare to see a significant
298.88 - change at the end of the period yes and
302.24 - I think this is the important thing you
305.48 - can't and and and I can't tell you how
308.04 - many times we stressed this you cannot
311.48 - time a vix
314.24 - expansion it's that's why it's so
317.20 - difficult to inventory long vix because
319.76 - you know at some point it's going higher
322.68 - but you cannot inventory it because it's
327.20 - untable if that's actually a word to
330.24 - hold if your timing is off yeah you
333.16 - cannot time
334.76 - it
336.80 - so what happens here is that you can see
340.48 - that that the the biggest risk to the
343.68 - upside is when the vix is below 15 and
347.28 - the least amount of risk to the upside
348.88 - in the vix is when the vix is above
351.00 - 30 um but you know again it's a very
355.72 - difficult thing to
357.08 - time you have almost no risk I shouldn't
360.08 - say no risk but longterm when the vix is
363.72 - above 30 it contracts longterm when the
366.96 - vix is between 15 and 30 it also
370.44 - contracts but when the vix is below 15
373.52 - it expands let's go to next
378.20 - slide even for individual stocks such as
382.20 - Tesla when the implied volatility is
384.56 - very low 75% of the 45-day periods
388.56 - experienced the vix Exchange of less
389.88 - than 3.8 points very similar to the Spy
392.76 - almost a tenth of a point difference but
395.16 - as a result the significant changes by
396.72 - the end of these periods were relatively
398.96 - rare So if you're betting on implied
401.40 - volatility going higher in Tesla again
404.60 - it only happens from very low levels of
406.72 - implied volatility it does not happen
409.96 - when the vix is above
413.80 - 30 it's interesting to see how close the
416.88 - vix and the Spy are to each other when
419.96 - you just look at this stuff let's go
421.60 - next
423.84 - slide so the other main factors that
426.68 - drive p&l of a short premium trade are
428.56 - Delta and Theta trade p&l often comes
431.64 - from time Decay Theta and from Price
433.76 - movement Delta more than it does
435.76 - volatility that's a very fair statement
438.08 - um you know we're volatility sellers so
440.12 - we're more dependent on volatility
442.68 - contraction um
444.80 - but you know there's a good little good
448.00 - little slide let's go next next
451.84 - slide as shown in our previous studies
454.04 - selling premium in low implied
455.96 - volatility low ivr can be profitable
459.60 - even if it can be minimum though it's
462.60 - reasonable to
464.16 - mitigate um IV expansion so again when
468.16 - IV is really low reduce the number of
469.68 - contracts in overall size and maintain
471.88 - some short Delta to offset the vager
474.12 - risk the vager risk is just that
475.56 - volatility
477.00 - expands and that's mostly going to
478.80 - happen in down mod
480.00 - let's go to the last slide
