0.12 - what percentage of my portfolio would be
2.52 - appropriate to put in crypto crypto is
5.08 - one of the best performing assets of
6.60 - 2024 I was underweighted in crypto by a
9.44 - lot 1% or or less I don't have a lot for
12.48 - me it's a small percentage of my
14.28 - portfolio you know we did a study on
15.84 - this years ago when crypto wasn't at the
18.12 - time we said one 2 or 3% gave you
21.72 - virtually no downside and nothing but
24.20 - upside based on the implied volatility
26.32 - of crypto and the asymmetric upside and
28.16 - everything else it made sense to have
29.60 - one two or 3% like if I asked my son
32.28 - who's 32 he would say he's 50% you know
35.20 - so really I think it depends a little on
37.04 - what your age is what you know how you
38.52 - think about markets things like that a
40.04 - couple of percent is an absolute
41.96 - no-brainer I mean the only reason we
43.60 - have less than 1% is because we've been
45.56 - a seller on the way up cuz I guess we
47.16 - were in early
