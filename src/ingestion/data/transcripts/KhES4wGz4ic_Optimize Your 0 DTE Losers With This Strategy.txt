0.04 - so zero DT options this is recovery
1.96 - rates for zero DTS zero DT option
4.56 - markets are some of the fastest and most
7.16 - liquid available for option Traders so
9.44 - far research has been encouraging for
12.00 - approaches based on premium selling and
13.64 - capturing profits aggressively and
16.20 - actually our research was even positive
18.20 - when you did the opposite in bought
19.64 - options you just had to be fast
21.12 - everything is fast like you got a couple
23.12 - of you got a couple of minutes to a
24.76 - couple of hours you don't have all day
26.40 - on the Zero DTS but one of the things we
28.96 - don't talk about is how do you handle
30.72 - losers for the research we've been
32.72 - letting losers go all day is there a
34.32 - better way to do it and when a zero DT
37.16 - short premium trade is looking bad what
40.80 - have been the costs and benefits to
42.20 - holding on hoping for an improvement
44.44 - verse closing the trade and accepting
46.80 - defeat Tony and I just so you know first
50.00 - move we make is we try to make an
52.20 - adjustment defensive first move is
54.24 - defensive second move we accept defeat
57.20 - we are not going to fight this before
59.16 - noon 1:00 hopefully before before the
61.64 - few first vrs like we will we will make
64.76 - one attempt or two attempts to fight
66.44 - selling premium also yeah we're premium
67.96 - sellers we'll make one or two attempts
70.24 - to fight it and then we will accept
72.92 - defeat we're not going to let it go to
75.32 - to hell you know in the afternoon 18
77.84 - months worth of research looking at uh
80.64 - selling strangles 35 Deltas 25 deltas
84.52 - and 15 Delta
86.24 - strikes um we checked at these positions
88.96 - at this are central time so 10:00 a.m.
91.80 - hour and a half after the opening noon
94.00 - and 2:
95.28 - p.m. um we isolated those trades that
98.36 - were down and those trades that were
99.92 - down by at least 10% and 25% of initial
103.40 - cost so you sell something for $5 25% it
108.24 - goes to 10% is 550 25% is 625 We
112.52 - examined how those losing trades
114.04 - performed when they were
116.20 - inspected um and the close was it better
119.04 - to exit a loser or give it a chance to
120.60 - turn around all the trades were assumed
123.28 - to close at Mid price which is a little
125.84 - bit misleading because you're probably
127.28 - going to want to do it you're probably
128.96 - going to have to do it a tick or two
130.08 - worse and also just to save on March Mis
133.16 - leading but that's the way that the only
134.24 - way not misleading but the only way for
135.68 - us to figure it out so just take off
137.48 - another nickel or so and also if you
139.96 - want to buy the wings which most people
141.32 - do you have to take off about another
142.92 - dime the whole process so all right
147.96 - better to exit loser or give it a chance
151.04 - to turn around what's Your Gut I mean I
153.48 - exit a loser so I exit a loser too right
157.24 - so um let's hoping that wins I'd be I'd
159.96 - be okay if it doesn't though I'd be fine
161.88 - yeah let's go next slide and obviously s
164.76 - don't didn't know how many slides there
165.68 - are so we haven't looked at this prior
167.32 - so go ahead no no we've been busy and we
170.32 - we've been you know too busy trying to
174.16 - too busy trying to fix trying to disrupt
176.08 - all Victor Jones theories on the world
178.32 - on life um okay so these are 10 a.m.
184.64 - losers at greater than 25% of the
188.32 - initial credit 10 am. losers at greater
191.32 - than 25% of the initial credit so um and
196.40 - and we have it in three categories here
198.40 - so the Improvement percentage the
201.16 - average p&l change if left on to the
203.68 - close and the sear of holding through
207.16 - the close now the carar is what's going
209.20 - to happen you're wor wor 5% of all cases
211.88 - conditional value yeah conditional but
213.24 - it's worst 5% of all cases the middle
215.92 - column the 25 Delta strangles is
218.28 - probably the one that fits us most live
220.72 - in the area that we live in the most so
224.80 - if you improving the position it's about
228.04 - a 55 you know this is at 10 a.m. and
231.20 - this is when you have a a loss greater
232.88 - than okay so the Improvement is about
236.08 - 55% um I I if if the average pen change
240.20 - if you leave it onto the close is about
242.40 - $37 it's
245.00 - positive that's okay not too bad no not
248.36 - too shitty okay let's go to the next
252.28 - slide so this
254.52 - one this
257.48 - is this is if you had Losers of just
260.40 - greater than 10% so it's not quite as
262.84 - bad you know and this one you can see
265.48 - the Improvement numbers are you know
267.20 - about the same the average p&l change
270.04 - which this makes more sense to me
271.32 - because it's kind of more in line is
273.04 - still a positive number if you left on
274.36 - the close and the cab bars are always
276.36 - going to be high significantly higher
279.80 - now go to the next slide
283.76 - Beth and this is if you lost by any
288.24 - amount so this is if you you you weren't
290.96 - able to control you know just you had no
293.72 - control of what's going on and so this
295.92 - one the average p&l changes if you left
297.72 - on till the close these numbers are all
299.36 - going to be negative so if you you know
303.04 - if you're if you're able to improve the
304.84 - trade you you actually put yourself in a
307.12 - pretty good position you're able to make
308.72 - an adjustment you're able to approve the
309.92 - trade you put yourself in at least a
312.04 - decent position where most the outcomes
314.36 - are fairly positive that I think is the
317.04 - main takeaway from this if you go to the
319.48 - next slide there's just a lot of data in
321.48 - here I don't want to spend too much time
322.72 - on it so this is if you wait to noon if
326.56 - you wait to noon the numbers the
328.48 - Improvement numbers drop trtic
330.16 - atically and the p&l numbers all go from
333.60 - all positive to all negative no bueno no
336.92 - bueno so this suggests that if you take
341.52 - advantage if you take your losses
343.80 - quickly you improve and then take your
345.88 - losses quickly you're okay or you
347.80 - improve on it right away
350.40 - but I if you wait until noon and you're
353.56 - not do anything o gets to be tough let's
356.00 - go next slide
358.32 - 10% new losers at 10% so at this number
362.76 - all the hold on to the close is still a
365.28 - negative number so whether you have a
366.96 - small loser or a big loser if you wait
369.20 - till noon to deal with it it's not going
371.72 - to help you that much let's go to next
374.24 - slide
375.88 - Beth and this is for noon losers at any
378.64 - amount you can see that the average
379.84 - penal change left onto the close is a
381.96 - very negative number so there is no good
384.64 - scenario here no no good scenario
387.00 - okay let's go to the next slide and this
390.12 - is if you wait till 2:00 and my guess is
392.00 - that this is going to be the worst of
393.16 - them all based on the way this
395.80 - everything's setting up so the
397.40 - Improvement numbers are down the average
399.12 - PE numbers get really ugly the SAR isn't
402.00 - as bad because you've lost more money on
404.00 - the trade um and these numbers are all
407.60 - bad go to the next slide and this is at
410.24 - 10% you know this is yeah all the
412.52 - numbers are bad here so the Improvement
415.24 - yeah there there's there's no good
417.24 - scenario of waiting for a long time to
419.36 - make an adjustment this is almost as
422.76 - clear as day do this early and you know
427.24 - do it early and and essentially move on
430.24 - I guess let's go next slide this is
432.96 - should be any amount yeah every single
435.76 - number here is a negative number this is
438.04 - not pretty so the longer you wait the
441.44 - more trouble you get into and the
443.16 - numbers just don't bear out if you go to
445.92 - the last last slide I think it is yeah
448.84 - so just as aggressively capturing
451.40 - winners has generally been the key to
453.44 - success in zero DTS it has also not paid
457.48 - to be patient with your losers you have
460.00 - to aggressively we are very aggressive
463.20 - so this is never an issue for us we are
465.00 - super aggressive but you have to address
467.48 - this stuff aggressively trades that were
469.68 - down early in the day recovered
471.20 - reasonably well but loses losses at noon
474.80 - or later were better off locked in than
477.80 - waiting
480.08 - the effects were reasonably consistent
482.24 - across strikes and the rapid management
484.84 - of zero DT positions also has the
487.88 - advantage of freeing up buying power
489.80 - which we should have mentioned before
491.32 - that's true the zero DT option markets
493.08 - are incredibly fast-paced and if you
494.56 - want to participate in them be ready to
496.56 - stay attentive and active throughout the
498.68 - day all of our research has pointed to
502.68 - if you're doing the zero DT trades do
505.64 - them do something do something and do it
507.88 - fast in that first half hour 45 minutes
510.92 - one hour either take your profits or
512.88 - make your adjustments you can't set it
514.68 - and forget it is really what it comes
515.96 - down to here
