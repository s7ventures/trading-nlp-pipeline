0.12 - can you ever have a situation where the
2.44 - vix is high above 30 but the SPX ivr is
6.76 - low below 20 if so how would you trade
9.20 - that it happens quite fre how would I
10.68 - trade it I probably wouldn't be looking
12.60 - at indexes I'd be looking at more
14.40 - individual stocks usually individual
16.20 - stocks going to have a much higher ivr
17.60 - anyway the BX above 30 is very high it
19.48 - only gets above 30 a few times a decade
21.76 - when that happens the ivr is generally
23.80 - really high for the vix to be above 30
26.60 - and the ivr to be below 20 you're going
28.96 - to have to have an elevated for almost a
30.76 - year that's only happened like one or
32.60 - two times in history how would you trade
34.68 - it well you stick to the rules about
36.88 - where ivr is even though the vix is high
39.36 - if the ivr is low there's better plays
41.00 - on the board you have to stick to the
42.84 - mechanics which basically say if the ivr
45.44 - is low you're going to stay away from
46.48 - the trade if the ivrs high you're going
47.60 - to get into the trade you're rarely
48.84 - going to have that situation I'm going
50.36 - to say almost never maybe we've had that
53.04 - situation once ever
