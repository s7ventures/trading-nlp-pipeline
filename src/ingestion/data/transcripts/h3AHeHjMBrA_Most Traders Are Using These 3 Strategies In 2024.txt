0.28 - the title is why neutral strategies May
2.48 - dominate a strategy dominates when it
4.28 - achieves equal or higher returns while
6.32 - bearing equal or less risks so what are
8.44 - we looking at here we got the expected
10.44 - returns as a percentage and then the
12.40 - standard deviation of risk you're saying
14.92 - more risk more expected return exactly
18.72 - La leis race returns ex all right going
22.80 - on to the next one here so examining
25.48 - straddles so it's reasonable to assume
27.76 - that the offsetting Delta would would
29.60 - reduce the directional risk and the
31.24 - straddle would be more profitable than
33.48 - either leg on its own in terms of risk
36.08 - taken and return so you're looking at a
38.20 - straddle versus each position so what
40.68 - you're saying is you're you you you're
42.84 - you have more risk potential just on one
46.20 - side of the market on either side of the
48.20 - market whether it be puts or calls you
50.52 - have more risk on just a single position
53.20 - because you don't have that Delta hedge
55.00 - from the other one so just this we be
57.80 - testing to uh those in indidual leg
60.92 - right put or call and then we put all
63.72 - those RS together which will be hedging
66.28 - both sides right and those results in in
69.68 - case of risk we're going to use standard
72.16 - deviations all right so getting on to
74.00 - the next slide here so how is this uh
77.04 - position how is this assumption played
78.76 - out historically does the risk reward
80.92 - advantage of a neutral strategy make it
82.72 - noticeably Superior to a directional
84.80 - premium selling so you're you're going
86.16 - to take uh neutral positions compared to
89.28 - one or the other directional premium
91.64 - selling position naked calls naked puts
94.44 - exactly all right so let's get to the
96.16 - study here so the study 2005 to present
99.20 - every trading day Place trades close to
101.96 - 45 days so you compare it selling at the
104.28 - money puts you're managing them at the
106.60 - 21 days at the money calls manage at 21
109.00 - days straddles manage at 21 days and
111.40 - then the strangles manage at 21 days I'm
114.08 - uh Little T typo there right yeah uh 21
117.00 - days and then so you're going to look at
118.48 - the average returns and the Ste standard
121.00 - deviation of returns um or the standard
124.00 - deviations of risk of risk of risk okay
126.68 - so we're going to see how wide the risk
128.36 - is as well as the Returns on all those
130.92 - strategies right you got a lot of you
132.32 - got a lot of data here this over the
133.44 - last 20 years right 05 till till now
136.52 - just about 20 years 19 years so a lot of
139.44 - information go ahead all right so the
141.20 - stradle achieved both higher returns and
143.36 - lower standard deviations of risk even
145.64 - though the call side loss most of the
147.52 - time if you look at a chart of spy it
150.24 - has gone up since that that time so
152.76 - you're naturally going to be losing on
154.64 - the call side tell me what we're looking
156.76 - at here so we got annualized p&l as a
159.72 - percentage of the underlying first of
162.12 - all when you take a look to this table
164.44 - the I mean numbers speaks by themselves
166.84 - right okay when you see at the money
168.80 - call the money put in the stradle this
170.64 - is the first table we compare the stats
172.84 - on both sides neutral neutral strategy
177.08 - when you look to uh annualize pnl as a
180.28 - potential of underlining you see at the
182.68 - money P have 32% at the money call it's
185.96 - a rul trade right negative 40% and strle
191.28 - outperform by
193.28 - 40% which means we have better returns
197.04 - when you compare neutraly and both when
200.20 - you compare one leg one leg by its
202.32 - individual stats right when you go to
204.44 - their risk which is standard
207.12 - deviations here didn't I didn't put
209.48 - percent percentage I I use actual
211.56 - numbers actual uh money right okay so it
215.92 - shows by at money call it's 130 right
219.88 - and the money puts 841 the Str which is
222.80 - neutral shows
225.72 - 602 and remember when you trade the only
230.96 - Ric which is simple for RO for everyone
233.40 - who trade we know like if you take huge
236.48 - risk the return will be also huge right
240.08 - yeah and if the minimum risk you take
242.44 - also returns you can expect huge returns
244.88 - right but take look to the uh neutral
247.96 - strategy strle have
251.64 - 602 risk in terms of standard deviation
254.84 - right and other at the money put have
258.64 - 800 at the money C have 600 and
261.52 - 330 so this give us the indication like
267.28 - in your life we don't need to be
269.20 - mediocre right Tom hates this
272.36 - strategy if we don't have to be mediocre
274.80 - right we need to take sides but in you
277.44 - tra when you are trading I prefer to
280.52 - stay neutral when you don't take won't
283.68 - take uh huge risk yes we th this shows
288.48 - me that we've obviously had some
290.08 - positive drift up over this period of
292.12 - time and then you know I'm in both cases
294.68 - of being bullish or bearish like if
297.12 - you're on one side of the trade you
299.32 - should expect to have um bigger uh
303.68 - potential returns but you're also going
305.48 - to have bigger risks because you have
307.48 - any there's no hedge in place on entry
310.72 - and so it's easier said to done than
312.72 - done to look at 2005 to now and say oh
315.00 - well I should have just sold puts the
316.28 - whole time you know that's a hindsight
318.28 - look back um even if you are selling at
321.48 - the money puts you're going to see the
324.52 - losing trades the standard deviation of
326.96 - risk to be much greater than have with
330.12 - the straddle you don't have the upside
332.12 - profit potentials as the as uh the naked
335.52 - puts do but you're going to have wider
338.52 - losses your your overall standard
341.08 - deviation of returns can be much much
343.08 - wider because you have those tail losses
345.96 - proces yeah even if you look at you the
348.52 - return in terms of um return on on your
351.44 - Investments you will see the the call
354.32 - it's negative 1.6 and the puts it's one
358.16 - and the sh it's 2%
360.32 - that's annualized return on investment
362.48 - we get if you see the standard deviation
364.96 - of your return on investment which is
366.88 - the risk M so the puts will be higher
371.00 - right because there's so much noise
373.16 - right there but the strle which is
375.36 - neutral strategy will be slightly lower
377.96 - according to the puts all right jumping
379.92 - into the next slide here then um so even
383.92 - the Strang will achieve both higher
385.40 - returns and lower standard deviations of
387.24 - risk even though the side was a losing
390.56 - trade and and this is I mean anytime you
392.72 - look at a long time frame you're always
394.92 - going to have losing short Delta
397.28 - positions when you when you see the mark
398.80 - the market as what effectively 3x in
401.72 - since 2005 2x minimum um I mean we're
405.16 - right there so you're obviously going to
406.72 - have losses on any neutral or any short
411.20 - type position the the thing to to key in
414.84 - on is that you're you know the law the
419.60 - losses on those select times to the
421.68 - downside are much much greater because
423.60 - you don't have any sort of hedge on you
425.40 - don't have any sort of short Delta on
427.16 - your position you're you're one to one
429.28 - to the downside you see it here with
430.88 - your standard deviation of risk being
434.16 - you know much higher on the out of money
435.88 - puts exactly and when you compare this
438.12 - slide with the previous one you this
440.48 - Trad up has potential of losing more
443.76 - than strango right yeah if you see to in
446.68 - terms of risk the stro has more than
449.28 - three 3x of ring more than strangle has
453.76 - uh like for example St have 600 of the
457.12 - risk but on this triangle we have like
460.12 - 200 right which is my recommendation I
463.80 - don't need to take recommendation right
466.36 - but this triangle kindly outperform in
470.72 - terms of risk management when you're
473.08 - looking to longterm positional you have
475.88 - more you can do with it when you're
477.32 - selling a put or selling a call you can
479.04 - only roll it out in time or roll it up
481.36 - and out if you're on the call side if
482.72 - you have a strangle or straddle you can
484.92 - roll both those options are are bringing
487.20 - in premium and are bringing in value
489.76 - that you can capture over a period of
491.64 - time whereas with one-sided trades if
494.36 - you're wrong on direction that that part
496.48 - of the the the trade is tough exactly
500.64 - and I don't think there's someone who
502.28 - want to do the calls the wrong time
504.52 - because Co sucks right yeah reason to
507.56 - say Co sucks so D I mean until they work
511.36 - the the one once or
513.80 - twice all right let's move on to the
516.92 - takeaways here a couple more so while
519.00 - neutral strategies appear to outperform
521.72 - directional ones we may still look to
524.32 - take directional positions to stay
526.12 - engaged and build core positions there's
527.92 - nothing wrong with having a directional
530.04 - assumption exactly um however you build
532.56 - it you know the things that we control
534.36 - on Entry or volatility time or how heavy
537.60 - our directional assumption is those
539.44 - those are the things that you can
540.28 - ultimately control uh with your
542.44 - positions however a purely mechanical
545.52 - approach looking to optimize returns
547.44 - give given certain levels of risk may be
550.20 - exclusively to stay neutral if you're
552.80 - trying to to take less risk on both
555.68 - sides of yeah we we don't you don't we
559.20 - don't mind if you take a direction on
561.72 - any side but remember to say a
565.00 - mechanical use mechanical approach for
567.48 - you to control your trades
569.92 - and be small yeah be small all right
573.32 - last one takeaways so neutral strategies
576.60 - don't require any additional buying
578.80 - power so it's logical to sometimes avoid
580.64 - picking a direction selling the call
582.64 - doesn't you know against uh if you're
584.96 - just selling puts if you're selling a
586.72 - call against it won't use additional
588.24 - Capital brings in more premium gives you
590.20 - a little bit more um potential value to
592.64 - capture through the life the trade in
594.40 - the exam example of the Spy straddle and
596.68 - strangle it achieve both higher returns
598.80 - and lower risk than its individual
601.16 - components obviously you know positive
603.44 - drift over 20 years helps but uh in the
606.64 - short term on a trade bytrade base
608.36 - better off with the neutral position
610.28 - exactly
