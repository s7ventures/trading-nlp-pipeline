0.12 - I know all right let's do it these are
2.68 - um this is a market measure that uh our
5.20 - research team put together for today
7.04 - really just talking about shorten the
8.88 - vix and profiting from implied
11.60 - volatility after this is over we'll tell
13.08 - you about some of the upcoming events
14.80 - that we have on the calendar but
17.00 - shorting the vix ready for this shorting
19.64 - the vix I'm ready for this volatility is
21.52 - one of the more prominent examples of a
23.08 - me of a mean reverting nature that we
25.44 - have the ability to trade that's fair I
27.36 - would say that volatility pairs trades
30.00 - there's some divergences in different
31.88 - indices and things like that but I would
33.68 - say volatility and volatility itself and
36.24 - pairs Treads are probably the two that
38.16 - we have the most kind of evidence of
40.00 - mean reversion on let's go to next slide
42.04 - knowing this it should be easy money
44.56 - easy money Mr Batista I love that one
47.12 - buy an inventory volatility below the
49.68 - mean and only sell it when it spikes if
52.16 - it is mean reverting why can't you just
54.08 - buy it every time it dips okay give it
56.40 - to me then you're just going to hold it
57.96 - and when it goes up you're going to sell
59.28 - it sell it when it goes back down again
60.76 - you're going to buy it looks easy from
62.28 - the chart here scoop of chocolate scoop
64.28 - of vanilla let's go to the next slide
66.28 - however there's always an however oh we
68.48 - run into a couple of problems we can't
70.52 - buy the vix and the vix Futures have a
72.24 - natural Decay and if there is no runup
74.36 - in volatility by expiration they just
76.44 - lose money right when they say you can't
78.00 - buy vix they're talking about vix uh
79.72 - stock right I mean you could do vix
81.32 - options if you wanted to but that
82.72 - already prices in uh all the vix that's
85.92 - right so the long Vick strategies using
87.76 - options can often run into the same
89.28 - problem if the timing is off which is
91.04 - usually due to volatility clustering
93.28 - near low levels what that means is when
95.12 - volatility goes when volatility goes
97.40 - down it kind of sits around forever then
99.72 - it costs a lot of money to carry a vix
101.56 - position otherwise everybody would
103.04 - Geniuses Whoever thought of these
104.76 - product structure because you know we
106.76 - clearly didn't when they were first when
108.40 - they first came out with this stuff
109.72 - let's go next slide relative to our high
112.00 - probability profitable strategies such
113.76 - as shorts strangles the vix is a very
116.52 - tough trade so we looked at this 2014 to
120.24 - present managed the 21 DTE we looked at
122.76 - long call spreads um and these are long
126.60 - implied volatility strategies so we
128.36 - looked at long call spreads and we
129.96 - looked at Short puts and the long call
132.16 - spreads for 10 years the win rate's 50%
136.00 - right down the middle the short putut
137.68 - the win ratees obviously going to be a
139.08 - little higher 78% the average pnl 20 and
141.64 - 80 bucks the max loss is significantly
144.36 - greater than than amount that you make
146.72 - and the buying power used a lot um let's
150.48 - see if we can the average p on the short
152.40 - put looks okay the average p on the
154.28 - short on the long call spread H maybe
156.80 - it's okay let's take a look relative
158.64 - amount of buying power it's using so can
161.36 - we do the exact opposite of this long
164.08 - volatility strategy has selling call
166.00 - spreads on volatility spikes been
167.72 - profitable take a look cuz all this kind
169.44 - of stuff is neat so we're going to sell
171.80 - a spike in volatility by selling a call
174.80 - spread let's look at the next slide well
177.40 - the short Vic strategies have been much
179.48 - more consistent in their success and
181.36 - produced positive p&l on average so a
185.04 - short at the money call spread on a
187.04 - spike um 78% with a 94% p&l and a short
193.36 - 30 Delta call spread 86% that's selling
196.56 - the 30 Delta call 86% with 54 with $58
200.24 - so what's interesting here is that
203.88 - um selling vix essentially selling vix
207.92 - Deltas which is shorting the vix which
210.00 - is the title of this has worked much
212.04 - better than buying the vix and most
214.36 - people buy the vix as a hedge right but
216.36 - shorting the vix is worth works much
218.24 - better let's go to the next slide kind
219.96 - of the opposite of our thinking too a
221.56 - little bit here I mean I wouldn't I mean
223.04 - I'm short volatility in the strategies
226.00 - that I play but I never go to the vix
227.88 - and look to short vix yeah I don't sell
230.92 - I don't sell a lot of um I never have
233.76 - that position on synthetically right
235.84 - yeah we don't sell a lot of vix Deltas
239.24 - normally we probably should do more
241.64 - based on this study I think we should do
243.92 - more we just don't do it enough and and
245.68 - we probably do it in other things and we
247.76 - probably should use the vix more implied
249.56 - volatility is one of the more prominent
250.80 - examples of mean reverting of a mean
252.40 - reverting Market that we trade but it's
254.16 - tough to buy given the complex term
256.56 - structure it is incredibly difficult and
259.20 - Incredibly expensive to buy vix so maybe
261.60 - it makes more sense to short it that was
263.76 - the whole point of this thing and short
265.76 - it into defined risk risk way so short
268.28 - Vic strategies to perform in
269.88 - consistently profitable manner but we
271.72 - don't sell Naked calls to this market so
273.64 - we've done only toine risk trades it's
276.48 - actually been profitable and we don't do
278.44 - enough of that so we did this to kind of
280.24 - tell ourselves to hey we just need to
283.52 - consider um expanding our strategies
286.04 - into to short vix call spreads on
288.28 - rallies because we have not done enough
289.84 - of those um you disappointed with your
292.12 - performance yeah yeah I'm kind of
293.96 - disappointed my performance in the vix I
295.76 - I mean to be fair I don't think we've
297.72 - made a lot of money in the vix over the
299.04 - last couple of years years I think it's
300.44 - been very small and we can probably we
303.56 - probably should have done better yeah we
305.36 - used to do a lot of uh by Vick's Futures
307.72 - sell VI calls but that's very Capital
310.12 - intensive too you don't really Capital
311.48 - intensive really hard to manage I'd
313.36 - rather sell call spreads the problem
315.12 - with call spreads the mies are so damn
316.88 - cheap you have to do the at the money
319.00 - yeah
