0.08 - little disclaimer on what it is give us
2.28 - just your highlevel overview of the tool
6.04 - that we have in the pl platform it's
8.48 - like it's a stress test your position so
10.56 - we want to create something in the
12.16 - platform where client can look at the
13.60 - positions and see okay what if some
15.28 - happens right what if the market goes
17.52 - down 5% or my stock goes down up 10% or
20.96 - what happens if apply volatility goes up
23.16 - you know we want to be able to put those
24.48 - all things into a tool you can kind of
26.12 - see okay assess the risk and okay I'm
28.40 - okay with I'm okay with the risk maybe
30.20 - I'm not okay with the risk I want to do
31.56 - some stuff to offset the the losses
33.88 - right so and what's cool about the what
37.80 - you showed me yesterday is it's you can
40.16 - stress test your current filled
43.08 - positions from your positions tab but
45.08 - you can also put on kind of hypothetical
48.08 - what if situations like if if I put on
50.36 - the siren Condor let's throw this into
52.52 - the stress test and see how that might
54.36 - change and adjust my metrics yeah it
56.80 - takes in all your open positions right
59.00 - and then if we can Al create where you
60.88 - do some what if scenarios right and they
63.04 - also tell you where where the risk will
64.44 - be at in the risk raise beautiful
67.56 - beautiful let's jump to the next slide
70.08 - here so um when you're looking at kind
73.32 - of the features and we're going to show
74.52 - this all these are just kind of the ways
76.28 - that you can adjust all these uh inputs
79.72 - on the the risk analysis tool um you can
84.40 - get all of your positions on the risk
86.88 - analysis tool you can add new positions
89.24 - there's also like a span margin feature
91.88 - where you can look at if you're using
93.52 - Futures you can see that sort of uh
96.00 - change as well um just a little bit of
100.24 - about this and you'll be able to see
101.76 - both upside and downside in those uh
105.08 - changes so there the risk anal the risk
107.64 - array is in both sides of the market
109.72 - what happens if the the market itself
112.68 - goes up or down a certain percent as
114.84 - well as the changes in implied
116.64 - volatility yep and if you want to follow
118.64 - along while we go through these to get
120.36 - to this view to analyze this you just go
123.76 - to your positions tab on the desktop app
126.36 - click on the cap wreck button in the
128.44 - upper right corner and from there you
131.64 - can click on risk analysis uh and follow
135.88 - along and and kind of mess around with
137.48 - this as we go through
139.88 - it good stuff let's jump to the next one
143.76 - here so you can also change time inputs
147.60 - right so you have you have price by
149.92 - volatility time all these things can can
152.68 - be changed and adjusted you could and
155.12 - adjusted you could do that for the
156.60 - portfolio as a whole for new positions
159.12 - or for specific positions so you can you
161.64 - can change whatever sort of input
166.40 - specific to one position that you choose
169.28 - correct yeah we again we're using an
171.12 - option pricing model so we're taking
173.36 - those inputs in current price you know
175.96 - time to expiration everything else into
177.48 - the model right and then generating what
179.44 - the theic gains or loss would be on at
181.80 - different price points so you can see
183.88 - you can see exactly what will happen you
186.04 - know up 6% down 6% you know up 15% down
190.40 - 15% so you can see what the profit and
192.60 - losses are going to be like in JB Morgan
194.12 - you see that if we go down what 15%
196.68 - right with a stock right I lose six
198.76 - grand and then but then I make you know
200.60 - $1600 on the puts right so everything is
203.04 - getting offsetted as it get aggregated
205.04 - so you aggate the gains and losses right
207.24 - to determine on each price point
208.96 - determine what you're Expos OS is yeah
211.60 - and from here you can use uh percentage
214.44 - changes or you could use points so
217.80 - that's another way that you can kind of
219.52 - differentiate how you're analyzing the
221.52 - total portfolio or the positions within
223.24 - the portfolio uh and when you click that
225.84 - capar button you can either include
229.40 - everything in your portfolio or you can
231.28 - include specific uh positions that you
233.64 - have with those check marks before you
236.00 - click over to the risk analysis uh tab
238.52 - just next to it yeah nice part two is
240.24 - you can see we have price and IV so you
241.76 - can update that yourselves refresh it
244.00 - you can refresh refresh the prices you
246.32 - can refresh positions if you made a
248.12 - trade you want to make sure it's into
249.32 - the risk analysis to you click on
251.32 - positions to make sure this gets
253.24 - added yeah so clicking on any of those
255.40 - buttons in the upper left like price and
257.28 - IV price positions if you click on those
259.20 - buttons it just automatically refreshes
260.96 - it and makees sure that it's using up
262.92 - to-date information
265.28 - yep very good jump to the next one here
269.84 - so um the next slide two so we're
273.52 - looking at Greeks I believe is our next
275.76 - one here so um you can also change and
279.60 - see what changes in your in your Greeks
282.40 - based on all these situations so your
284.28 - Delta Theta bega show you how all of
286.96 - your positions change in those
289.40 - situations so by hovering over you know
292.24 - your specific
294.52 - um uh position step right you you you
298.16 - call them steps like so like each these
300.36 - you'll see the 1 2 3 4 and five at the
302.92 - top it's basically so if you have a 25%
305.88 - down move is what you're simulating each
308.80 - step is five 5% down to give you an idea
311.84 - of like you know along the way what your
314.88 - risk or reward is on both sides of the
316.68 - market but it'll show you your changes
320.44 - in in Greek exposure as well all along
324.60 - those steps going down yeah we want to
326.16 - make those stes equal you know equal
327.60 - distance to each other right and then I
329.48 - mean you can go in there and if you want
330.56 - man you can Al also change it too on on
332.72 - the left- hand side on on the
334.44 - percentages but yeah and the Greeks part
336.40 - is we're calculating the Greeks for each
337.96 - position right based on the current
339.88 - implied Val right and then you know also
342.88 - we we also roll up to Apple first uh
345.60 - aggre greets too so take all the
347.68 - positions offset offset the Greeks right
349.96 - and give you aggate for Greeks for each
351.96 - position too on the headings for
354.52 - Apple yeah I think especially with uh
357.52 - portfolio margin accounts it's important
360.52 - to understand how buying power can
362.52 - change with moves in the market with
364.00 - moves in IV and this kind of really
365.72 - helps you get a good understanding of
367.44 - how that might change in events that
369.88 - we're not foreseeing like the Japanese
372.08 - Yen unwind that that caused a lot of
374.08 - buying power changes with people that
376.00 - had bullish positions in the markets uh
379.16 - this is something that you can kind of
380.40 - utilize to synthesize a similar move or
383.92 - uh you know something more dramatic or
386.00 - less dramatic yeah and a great price too
388.08 - is like you say the field price too show
389.76 - them when when we put these inputs into
391.72 - an option pricing model right here's
393.52 - what your the price could be for the
394.84 - calls and puts right so the option
396.60 - pricing model is calculating you know
398.24 - theorical prices of your calls and puts
400.32 - to tell you okay where that if I sell
401.64 - that put at a dollar you know it goes to
403.52 - $7 right that that's the difference
405.40 - that's how you figure out the gains and
406.40 - losses on the position right so that's
408.32 - kind of nice you can see everything in
409.56 - there so we want to make displays that
411.96 - are transparent right yeah it doesn't
414.08 - any good if you do a stress test on a on
415.80 - a Monte Carlo model you know 10,000
418.00 - simulation what's that gonna do for you
419.32 - right what you want to do is be able to
420.88 - see yourself right call out Dr Data his
423.28 - Monte Carlos well he can come in and
424.84 - show all 10,000
427.04 - simulations but the good point here is
428.92 - that the clients can you know see
430.12 - everything our models are transparent
432.20 - and then they can do their own you know
433.64 - what if scenarios you know to see if
435.28 - they're comfortable with the risk or not
437.16 - right yeah and I think uh like going
439.56 - back to that an example that happened
441.48 - earlier this year the Japanese done
442.88 - unwind like uh I'm sure a lot of the
446.52 - conversations that were had on the
448.52 - margin desk were like okay I'm short
450.32 - this put in the E Min futures or I have
452.16 - this bullish position in the E Min
453.36 - Futures my buying power has expanded how
456.08 - can I mitigate this or how can I hedge
458.20 - this risk and that's where you can
459.80 - really bring in like okay if I buy this
461.52 - put two weeks out for further out of the
463.92 - money how is that going to affect my
465.96 - position how's that going to affect my
467.12 - buying power and that's where you can
468.84 - really uh adjust the Greeks and bring it
470.88 - in and let's jump to the next slide
472.64 - because that talks about that
474.64 - functionality and so you know one of the
477.00 - things that you can do is you can add in
478.92 - legs trades up to whatever uh you can up
482.72 - to four legs because that's the maximum
485.88 - order routing but um you can add on
488.88 - simulated trades or trades prior to you
491.92 - actually getting filled and placing you
493.60 - know placing them and getting filled on
495.00 - those trades and see how that will
497.08 - change or affect the risk parameters in
499.68 - your portfolio um as you go along so
503.08 - this is a really cool tool for as Mike
505.44 - said like if you're looking to hedge
506.80 - your portfolio I want to hedge um
510.28 - 10% down move or a 10% down move with a
513.16 - 20% pop in volatility you can simulate
516.00 - that via this um you know risk array
520.40 - yeah I mean to Mike's Point it's great
521.80 - for you know clients calling in trade
523.36 - desk they can send them to this tool so
525.00 - they can look at their risk right
526.04 - instead you know in terms of they can
527.60 - see what their losses and gains are and
529.80 - two is like for if you have like in JB
531.64 - Morgan if you have if you're have a
532.88 - hedge that's expiring today right well
535.16 - now you know to replace that hedge right
537.12 - so you know to offset the risk right so
539.08 - it's nice nice about that is you can see
540.56 - what happens with your hedge oh hedge
542.36 - expiring today you know am I comfortable
544.20 - with 10 grand of RIS maybe I'm not you
545.92 - know down %. so now I can replace that
548.56 - hedge right and then that kind of shows
550.76 - you what how that cut reduces your uh
552.68 - theorical
555.16 - losses love it love
557.60 - it let's jump to the next slide
560.96 - here um so for the price percentage
564.96 - changes so you can look the the way you
567.20 - can look at this is that you can have
569.56 - them based on uh just all of them
572.72 - together which is uncorrelated right so
574.72 - that's basically just saying across the
576.64 - board everything is down 20% right
579.08 - moveing everything you know the same uh
580.84 - price move for all symbols for all
582.68 - symbols beta waiting does it to spy so
585.76 - explain a little bit what how that how
589.20 - that functions yeah so I mean obviously
591.48 - spy everything everything beta weights a
593.16 - spy you know now we out functional you
594.92 - can spy you can actually ba we to other
596.36 - symbols too in this example you know spy
599.40 - obviously is is how everything is is
601.52 - looked at right and so if you have a a
604.12 - beta of two right meaning that you have
606.32 - a high beta stock right so if the SPX
608.80 - goes up you know down 10% that stack go
610.84 - down 20% right so what we're doing by
613.40 - probing the vaa beta is like a
614.76 - multiplier for the stress so you're
617.20 - you're say okay this if if SPX go 10%
620.00 - you have a two beta your symbol go down
621.88 - 20% we're going to show those 20% losses
624.28 - in terms of of the stress test yep so it
628.16 - and that's a really cool feature because
629.80 - it takes all of your positions not only
633.36 - the size but the correlation so like
635.80 - it'll account for the fact that um you
639.08 - know gold and silver have a low beta
642.52 - right if if any beta you know positive
645.36 - or negative correlation as well to spy
647.84 - so it doesn't just you know nuke
649.88 - everything 20% that feature allows you
652.32 - to take your portfolio as a whole and
654.84 - puts it you know together under beta
657.84 - weting that's why we always talk about
659.28 - dat waiting our positions and using that
661.84 - as like a risk met metric you'll see
664.44 - that in the risk array when we when we
666.40 - demo through and again like we're
667.56 - talking about transparent you can see
668.76 - the betas on the left hand side you know
671.12 - and then if you want to change it you
672.12 - can always change you can change your
673.52 - your stress test too like you know like
674.84 - the betas you can you can change your
676.80 - price move right to to where you think
679.08 - it should be you know so which is nice
681.48 - same with implied vals you can go in
682.88 - there and change them separately too so
684.48 - we made it or clients can make their own
686.36 - changes too it's not just you know what
688.24 - our we we think everything should be you
690.24 - know we're making it functionality
691.80 - scalability so you can do yourself yeah
694.48 - you can really like edit anything right
697.72 - and you can get super granular like you
699.92 - can say this position goes down 20% and
703.52 - volatility expands 10% and you could say
705.72 - this one doesn't move like you right if
707.36 - you have different options on different
708.64 - series you may take down janv Val you
710.92 - may take up dval you know I mean
713.08 - whatever you want to do it you can do
714.12 - your own little changes on your vow
716.08 - right to see how that affects the option
718.24 - pricing model yeah and especially if
720.36 - you're using the beta we to feature you
722.68 - can like we've talked about you it's
724.64 - default to spy but you could change it
726.20 - to something like the q's like maybe you
727.80 - think if there's going to be a big move
729.40 - in the market maybe it's Tech that leads
731.80 - that or drags the market down you can
734.08 - change the beta weighted symbol from Spy
736.00 - to the cu's and see how those figures
740.64 - change jumping over to the next one here
742.76 - we're talking about the IV um changes
746.16 - that you can do give me a little bit of
747.72 - a explanation between points and
750.60 - percentage right so we did it we had two
752.64 - ways of doing it one you can do
753.88 - percentages so if you move IV 20% it's
756.72 - going move each individual option IV by
759.40 - 20% right yeah okay IV shift is just
762.52 - moving everything that that by the same
764.80 - imply Val move so let's let's say that
767.56 - vix rout now is like 15 let's say we
769.92 - want to do like a 50% uh of the vix
772.72 - right so let's say seven points s half
774.28 - points you can go there and go and take
776.44 - go iy shift and go seven points it'll
777.88 - move each one individual imply vales
780.00 - seven points so your imply vales a 30 it
782.52 - goes to 37 your imply vales of 40 it
785.20 - goes to 47 so there's different ways
787.40 - where you want to do in terms of how you
788.84 - wanted to U program your imply
791.12 - volatility shocks you know and so that's
793.08 - where you made it so you have different
794.76 - ways looking at it and again you can do
796.72 - that on the as the group as a whole or
800.84 - each individual option you can even get
803.20 - goofier and go and change you know
805.52 - whatever option implied volatility you
807.84 - want specific option
809.72 - specific position correct yeah really
814.84 - cool um jumping to the next one here so
820.44 - um so this is for points so points you g
824.72 - you gave us that already so points does
827.04 - the position as a whole correct so it
829.16 - moves everything the same so if you have
830.80 - apple vow or Tesla vow it's can move
833.28 - everything seven points you move
834.80 - everything seven
837.04 - points all right give us our take away
839.36 - we'll finish up the slides and we're
840.52 - going to get right into it and we'll
841.84 - give you your disclaimer so we make
843.48 - everything all kosher here you know we
845.32 - try um so the taste trade risk analysis
848.20 - tool is designed to offer comprehensive
850.04 - and dynamic insights into your trading
852.16 - portfolio allows traders to be their
854.64 - best Risk Managers I like that we we
856.72 - have great ones here but you should be a
858.52 - good one as well uh allows you better
861.24 - understanding of how different scenarios
864.16 - impact your trading portfolio and
865.68 - positions and you can make informed
867.48 - adjustments to your positions to
869.32 - optimize your risk reward profile give
871.96 - me my disclaimer and then we're jumping
873.52 - into the
875.12 - platform definely fantastic again if you
878.68 - got questions put them in the YouTube
880.88 - chat Mikey's going to be throwing those
882.16 - our way as well um but we want to show
885.76 - the
886.76 - platform um and the feature itself we're
890.04 - going to have you walk through change in
892.24 - some stuff adjusting some stuff so um we
895.84 - will do that once we get this platform
897.80 - up yeah um while we work on that David
901.40 - asking what's the current Apex 40% down
903.92 - Market multiplier today is it five or 6%
906.68 - of a account that lick you know what
908.08 - he's talking about so about a year and a
910.16 - half ago they uh do know what he's
912.40 - talking about I don't know that man
914.00 - knows everything that's an encyclopedia
916.32 - with a with a mouth so uh OCC came out
919.88 - with uh stressing clearing firms so
921.88 - there is a down 40% number they use for
925.40 - firms in terms of how much that they put
927.80 - up Capital right and so then we've hit
930.40 - since they hit us and we have to Apex
931.88 - had trickle down the clients where where
933.72 - we have we have to imply a 40% number to
935.96 - their portfolio rate and then we get a
938.08 - function of their net L to exposure so
940.88 - you know I think six or seven ratio is
943.28 - kind of where we're at right now
946.64 - so there you go David you tried to stump
950.00 - the schami remember that remember that
952.68 - show it was with um Johnny Carson no
956.24 - it's uh Burman Chris Burman CH whoop oh
961.00 - yeah yeah yeah like he used to have a
962.20 - sport I thought it was a sports show
964.12 - well you didn't get them but it was a
965.24 - good question um all right so we're
968.00 - going to get into it so on the portfolio
970.24 - page on the platform you'll see in the
972.72 - upper right hand corner this Capital
974.36 - requirement button you click on that and
977.04 - it'll give you your risk arrays here all
980.60 - the things that you can change you can
982.16 - pick which positions you want to include
984.96 - you could have them all here which is
986.52 - what I had selected you can select
989.64 - specific positions I just go in here
991.76 - randomly click a couple it'll show you
993.48 - only those positions we're going to get
995.60 - into it here we should have some fun
997.36 - with it and just use all the positions
999.12 - but uh might lessen it if we have to so
1003.68 - when we get in
1005.00 - here give me a a scenario and show me
1008.32 - how to put that in here better yet I'm
1011.84 - going to give you a scenario I want you
1013.96 - to tell me and walk me through how we do
1017.52 - that so let's say the market goes down
1021.20 - or let's do our Price p our price change
1024.00 - of 10% we're going to say IV goes um
1028.44 - from a vix of 15 which we're at right
1030.88 - now let's say
1032.20 - 25 how would I make those adjustments
1034.56 - and show me some of the things that I'd
1035.84 - see so we would go into override right
1038.56 - okay and click on
1040.84 - uncorrelated and we're going to make
1042.40 - that 20% right okay so that now that
1045.16 - we're going to say everything goes down
1046.52 - 20 everything goes down 20% everything
1048.20 - goes down 20 % okay then we go IV shift
1051.28 - and now if we can do a couple things if
1052.76 - we want to go you know we can move the
1055.92 - uh IV shift points is seven points
1058.48 - relative to the vix relative so 50 if
1060.76 - you take a 50% move right so goes to uh
1064.12 - you say 15 to 25 25 so 10 points we can
1068.04 - we can you know we can move it up 10
1069.28 - points okay you know and then that will
1072.00 - move all the imply valves up 10 points
1073.96 - on each one of these uh symbols or we
1076.40 - can just do like a 20% move you know
1078.32 - however however you want to do do it you
1079.24 - know cuz I mean 15 to to 30 that's a
1081.80 - that's a big move right so I mean we can
1083.48 - go up by 50% in case you want to do that
1085.92 - and take the IV shift and go up 50%
1087.80 - percentage moves 50% okay so it's a big
1091.84 - one big that's a big one okay you know
1094.04 - so just going to take each individual
1096.04 - imply valow and move it by 50% so if you
1099.20 - have a uh a 30 imply Val right that goes
1101.96 - to 45% right so everything gets moved
1104.76 - and this is looking at so on both and
1107.24 - each one of these positions you can see
1109.12 - the the change in the in the profit or
1111.40 - loss based on each of these moves
1112.76 - correct what's cool is that it gives you
1114.28 - both sides of the market obviously on an
1116.60 - up you know this implied volatility if
1118.40 - you were thinking that it was going to
1120.32 - be an up move there's no input to say
1122.88 - like up 20% or down 20% they give you
1126.08 - both if you were thinking that this was
1127.84 - an up move you would probably say that
1129.72 - volatility wouldn't change here or would
1132.24 - go down you could adjust this to be down
1135.36 - 10% and that'll change your risk profile
1138.00 - you'd be looking on the on the right
1140.08 - side of this risk analysis so you can
1142.76 - change both the the array shows you both
1146.28 - directions of whatever your inputs are
1149.04 - in terms of the market moving that
1151.36 - direction um but it also gives you it
1154.04 - gives you the upside and the downside
1155.96 - for both those correct and if you want
1157.52 - to make changes like I receive indexes
1159.16 - right you know we go up the Val then
1161.04 - comes down right so you can make some
1162.88 - changes to that right because you know
1164.36 - obviously uh in index is you know Mark
1166.84 - goes down B goes up right you know so
1169.24 - you can make those own changes too on
1171.20 - that too but yeah I mean you can go
1172.76 - around there make your own uh what you
1175.04 - think a a reasonable one day move is
1177.12 - right you know so you know it maybe a 5%
1179.88 - move 7% move right and then what's a
1182.68 - reasonable uh imply valti he moving on
1185.40 - one day right you know and then kind of
1187.44 - put that in there I think one of the
1188.68 - next things we're goingon to go have on
1190.04 - there we're going to actually take some
1191.40 - his historical dates and put into risk
1193.56 - analysis I I was telling that before
1195.52 - where we might take a 2020 Co day uh we
1198.40 - might take the uh 2008 banking crisis so
1201.68 - we're going to have some historical
1202.80 - Market events and we're going to put
1204.56 - down risk analysis to see how your
1205.92 - position would have done through those
1207.60 - days so we're taking those price moves
1209.88 - and those volatility moves so Dr data's
1212.12 - got the data for me that's so we working
1215.28 - on that so you'll be able to to be like
1217.24 - give me a OA crash scenario or covid
1220.60 - crash scenario just automatically yeah
1223.60 - and that's really powerful because this
1225.32 - is a complex tool and it's you like
1227.32 - we've we've spent minutes 10 minutes
1229.48 - here learning how to use it we haven't
1230.92 - even scratched the surface so much and
1233.36 - that's that's really powerful because a
1235.28 - lot of people like we obviously don't
1237.28 - know what's going to happen tomorrow or
1239.20 - in the couple of days like jpow could go
1241.92 - on today and say oh our our 25 base
1245.08 - point cut that everyone's expecting
1246.48 - we're actually raising rates like
1248.00 - something could happen Market goes crazy
1249.92 - but if you have a benchmark like the
1252.92 - covid crash or financial crisis or
1255.40 - whatever now you can see okay my
1257.72 - position is way too big or you know oh I
1259.76 - could do this to hedge this risk if
1261.80 - something like this were to happen uh so
1263.92 - I think that's really powerful and the
1265.16 - other you can also I know you shown how
1266.72 - to simulate a trade too yeah on the
1268.96 - platform we can also do that let's let's
1271.08 - add that in there too so um I actually I
1274.12 - was showing too that you can change the
1276.08 - date of when this situation happens and
1278.84 - so I just mve this to like early January
1281.84 - uh just to show that as well and the the
1284.44 - platform will adjust for positions like
1286.36 - this Natty gas position I have that's
1288.08 - expiring in a couple days it's gone so
1290.64 - it's off it'll simulate all those things
1293.16 - like it'll take off positions that
1295.36 - expired or or you know uh it'll account
1299.20 - for the time change as well all those
1301.64 - things come into play here um just going
1304.76 - through those yeah we're just plugging
1305.68 - those inputs into the option price Model
1307.32 - and it's how we're getting the theorical
1308.88 - value the calls and the puts yeah so why
1311.32 - don't we go
1313.20 - and let's see you want to put a yeah
1316.44 - pick one of your positions and throw on
1317.92 - like a new position
1319.04 - and then we can we can bring that in you
1320.96 - don't have to get it filled you can just
1322.40 - put it on and we can bring it in to
1323.68 - simulate how that would adjust okay
1326.04 - let's do um like
1329.84 - AMD put on a put spread there this
1333.08 - morning so we'll do the one I did for
1335.64 - Johnny trades um we go to the cap
1340.16 - requirement and I'm going to just I'm
1342.04 - going to just isolate that position just
1343.80 - so we can see it here so the risk
1346.04 - analysis this is what I have on right
1347.64 - here yeah then you have the add the
1348.80 - trade in the upper right in the upper
1350.44 - right hand corner it's going to add
1351.92 - whatever I just put on there as well so
1354.68 - you don't right you don't have to send
1355.80 - the trade you don't have don't send
1357.56 - don't send a exchange you can go in
1359.32 - there create the trade here in a risk
1360.92 - analysis and look at it before you want
1362.16 - to send it and so this is showing that
1364.60 - short put spread that I just added on um
1368.60 - into the risk analysis so it gives you
1371.52 - an idea and just to take that back um
1374.92 - you could see you know I've got a little
1376.56 - bit of risk to the downside obviously
1378.96 - profits to the upside because I have
1380.40 - some long Delta there if I add on this
1382.40 - put spread you have to recreate oh I got
1384.12 - to redo it I'm sorry so if I go to the
1387.48 - page uh I put this back
1390.28 - on go to the cap requirement add the
1393.44 - order legs you see now I have this
1395.08 - downside risk because I'm adding a put
1396.64 - spread to an already long Delta position
1399.20 - it just adds in all the inputs that you
1402.12 - that you know you're putting in that
1405.56 - trade yeah you can change all these so I
1408.20 - want to also isolate too all the things
1411.52 - that you can change in the input so if
1414.20 - you hover over any part of this uh
1417.68 - section it'll allow you to to change the
1420.92 - price of the underlying so I could make
1422.44 - my own manual um price change here and
1425.20 - let's say it goes to
1426.76 - 97 let change that value you can change
1429.72 - the implied volatility of each option
1433.12 - itself you could do it of the whole
1434.76 - thing of all those options here you can
1437.68 - see it's changing all those implied
1439.16 - volatility so all those things
1441.28 - are at your will to yeah we want to make
1444.44 - some where you can make your own changes
1445.76 - right we don't want some that's static
1447.20 - right to here here the predetermined
1449.44 - levels right we want you know clients to
1451.96 - be able to be interactive and be able to
1453.68 - decide what they want and again you know
1455.60 - nice to know this like you know if
1456.88 - clients have any suggestions they want
1458.04 - to see you know let me know because
1459.44 - we're always working to enhance our
1461.76 - models so they see something they like
1463.36 - to see in Risk analysis you love to see
1465.40 - you know what they're what they think
1467.16 - and everything else so
1468.88 - I want to add so that we can because I
1471.04 - don't have that many Futures I just have
1472.52 - a m micro Euro and a Natty gas butterfly
1475.68 - that's basically going away um so let's
1478.72 - go in here and just put on a short put
1481.28 - in es and just see how that you know
1483.88 - affects my portfolio and we'll go into
1485.88 - the span margin scenarios as well
1487.88 - because it's another cool feature here
1489.48 - so I'm going to go back here I'm G put
1491.24 - my whole position in there we're going
1493.40 - to add the short putut so you can see
1495.28 - it's obviously a huge effect on my
1497.04 - positions because it's a big position
1500.08 - relative to everything else you know you
1501.40 - have a short put in es it's you know
1504.52 - much bigger position than my little
1505.84 - Johnny trades that I have on here um
1508.80 - when we go to the span margin uh
1511.88 - scenario uh oh can we add the new
1514.68 - position no it's got it's got to be a
1516.12 - fill position okay but if you hover over
1518.36 - it I'll show you something that's pretty
1519.52 - cool on our span margining okay if you
1522.72 - hover over the initial requirement it
1524.80 - we'll break down to where it's coming
1526.16 - from in terms of the span model so take
1528.52 - your cursor and just there go we're
1530.40 - going to we're going to put it I'm going
1531.36 - to just put on a put spread so we'll do
1533.80 - the oh yeah we'll do a wide put spread
1536.92 - here just so we can show this um so
1540.24 - we'll do this wide put spread out of
1542.16 - money put spread we'll put this
1545.60 - on okay so when we go to the positions
1549.56 - we'll go to the capital requirements
1551.52 - section so click on report to refresh it
1555.08 - okay report this will refresh it got my
1558.44 - auto Refresh on there too oh yeah so
1562.36 - what can I change so so if you hover if
1563.96 - you hover if you hover over initial
1565.28 - requirement M with your cursor you
1568.04 - should see that so it kind of tells you
1569.84 - where it's coming from what's so span
1571.56 - has 16 different scenarios you know and
1574.28 - so volatility price yeah volatility uh
1577.28 - volatility unchange up and down and then
1579.84 - price moves so they basic time too right
1582.40 - well they take basically they take what
1583.96 - a one- day move would be let's say for
1585.92 - ES is 5% right okay so they they take 5%
1590.04 - uh and they move it uh a third 2/3 3/3
1593.36 - so they they break it up to you know so
1595.48 - so full move would be 5% then they break
1597.20 - up into a third of five% two3 of 5% 5%
1600.68 - and they apply a I think a 40% imply Val
1603.44 - shock to it okay you know and then
1605.16 - scenario 15 and 16 they take the price
1607.16 - move was 5% they times it by three they
1610.36 - become 15% and they take a third of
1612.40 - those of of the of losses as a
1614.32 - requirement so they so it's it's but we
1616.52 - can break that uh snar down through our
1618.68 - risk analysis meaning we have the inputs
1620.32 - there to put into it to mirror what uh
1623.56 - spam margin be look we're looking at but
1625.84 - it's kind of nice you can kind of tell
1627.32 - like from where where it's coming from
1629.08 - Scenario 14 you know we know that's
1631.36 - that's the full 5% move right and so we
1633.64 - can kind of recreate that to show you
1635.84 - where the risk is coming from and these
1637.24 - are the see I want to try and put this
1639.60 - on as a I'm gonna make this a naked
1642.20 - position so that because I want to see
1643.68 - the crazy changes do they account for
1646.00 - limit up and limit down moves or is is
1648.24 - that kind of like the same thing yeah I
1650.28 - mean they they have a circuit breakers
1651.88 - in place right okay I'm going to make
1654.20 - this as wide as possible so we we wanted
1655.96 - to take out the the black model of span
1658.44 - and be able to put to to be able to put
1660.52 - on risk analysis so we can kind of show
1662.84 - like you know what other they're looking
1664.36 - at it so yeah so just another nod to uh
1668.52 - Clarity and transparency around like how
1671.40 - these things are actually being
1673.00 - calculated right all right I want to
1675.44 - make this wider so we can see just
1679.64 - I'm trying to do it with my limited
1681.44 - capital on this
1683.24 - account you're going to be putting a
1685.00 - margin call right away like guys here
1688.60 - that's true you could you could iners
1691.40 - you know that's how they did it back in
1692.84 - the day you get Tony Batista and he
1695.20 - would uh he'd come to your door with a
1696.88 - baseball bat that was how they did uh
1698.56 - margin calls back in the
1700.36 - day all right so we got I got a I got a
1704.20 - wide put spread here in es what am I
1708.32 - seeing and if you and if you scroll down
1710.12 - if you go to the far right where those
1711.16 - arrows are it'll kind of tell you where
1712.96 - it's coming from so scenario 14 or 16
1716.96 - now scenario 16 I'm yes so that's so
1720.12 - that's that's taking the price moving
1721.64 - moving to 300% like I said before it's
1723.52 - going from taking it say one day mov 5%
1726.72 - to 15% and then they're cutting a third
1729.44 - of that as uh those losses as margin so
1732.72 - that so that's three consecutive 5% yeah
1735.48 - so 15 yeah 15% in the market as a whole
1738.16 - it's a whole right so basically saying
1739.76 - from 300% move means it goes from 5% to
1742.80 - 15% take those those those losses haut
1746.32 - highcut those losses that's going to be
1748.20 - a Marin
1749.24 - requirement and I think this is really
1751.04 - important especially for I know there's
1752.92 - some people that are you know selling
1754.52 - puts in mini
1755.88 - Futures uh this will help you understand
1758.60 - like the true size that you can absorb
1761.64 - like if you're doing one or two
1762.76 - contracts but you're but you're way over
1765.16 - Lev levered from a notional value
1766.88 - standpoint this will show you how much
1768.96 - you can truly absorb like if you have a
1771.60 - a one day two- day move where it's you
1773.40 - know down 10% 15% and you can't absorb
1776.28 - that then that's problematic and you
1777.60 - need to do yeah you go to risk
1779.76 - analysis's can I do this for Mees well
1782.92 - let's go let's go to risk analysis real
1784.24 - quick and then uh so we should be able
1786.96 - to see that on there on the on the
1789.12 - capital requirement no just go risk
1790.44 - analysis and then just put on ES oh you
1793.60 - just want to do es yeah so take
1795.12 - everything else off see how close we are
1799.20 - so we have the 20% down with a 50% pop
1802.44 - involv yeah so take everything off and
1803.96 - just just make it a uh 15% move down oh
1807.20 - I have AMD in there
1810.52 - too
1812.80 - 15% okay and then take off the Val shock
1817.16 - okay so we're going to do this at
1818.76 - basically no
1821.12 - V yeah so you know so that's kind of how
1823.72 - they they look at it in terms we have to
1825.08 - take off AMD but it's fine yeah they're
1826.40 - doing 55% but going to cut about a third
1828.72 - of that for the margin requirement so
1830.16 - and that's
1831.52 - that's 50 is here correct correct what
1836.04 - what's this yellow box I had saw a
1837.76 - question from so the yellow box is just
1839.72 - basically it's just telling you where
1841.44 - the larg largest loss is coming from so
1843.20 - on the risk Ray we we put the the
1844.88 - colorcoded just client telling the
1846.64 - client okay we're it's coming from step
1848.84 - five right so the client can see where
1850.64 - the large loss is coming from and it
1852.28 - does it so like on this AMD position at
1854.72 - a certain point cuz my position would
1857.36 - basically be zero it basically tells you
1860.16 - this position is at its Max correct if
1862.48 - you have like spread trades or if you're
1866.08 - you know long calls or long call spreads
1868.36 - or whatever and the market drops those
1869.88 - call spreads go to basically zero
1871.24 - there's no more loss after that correct
1872.80 - correct so it's kind of nice it's a way
1874.44 - of us you know we kind of like to make
1876.12 - the colors more more like a heat map
1877.68 - kind of look to it you know yeah so you
1879.84 - know clients can see it and we want to
1881.32 - make sure they can it's easy to see
1882.88 - right easy to read right so
