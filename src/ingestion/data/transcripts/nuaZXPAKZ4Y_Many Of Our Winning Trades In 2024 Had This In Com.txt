0.16 - 2024 we did the best Market measure part
3.24 - one yesterday we are doing part two
7.00 - today the best time of the day to buy
10.72 - and sell does intraday seasonality
14.20 - exists statistically which five minute
16.84 - bar is the weakest during the day for
18.60 - the S&P 500 using 15 years of market
21.72 - indices and Futures ETFs 11 years of
24.92 - vix um we C we first covered or I'm
30.00 - sorry we first convert the 5 minute
31.88 - price and volume bars into an intraday
34.16 - percentile then we calculate the average
36.28 - of these percentiles for each symbol to
37.68 - get their intraday strength as well as
40.20 - their monthly and overall strength what
42.88 - we
43.72 - found was that
46.08 - low am and high we found a low am and
49.72 - high PM rule market indices tend to be
53.16 - lower in the morning and stronger in the
55.52 - afternoon buy them now
57.88 - bat that's right buy them when you can
60.92 - vix tends to be higher in the morning
63.96 - and weaker in the
65.84 - afternoon yes as time goes by there's
68.28 - less risk
70.52 - sure now I'm going to say something
72.68 - about lower in the morning and higher in
74.88 - the afternoon that is a very
79.00 - typical byproduct of bull
82.36 - markets in bare markets it's the exact
85.20 - opposite so don't get fooled by the bull
87.16 - market bare Market thing the reason that
89.48 - this the last 15 years we've been in a
91.20 - bull market and in Bull markets you open
93.84 - lower and go
95.36 - higher in bare markets which we haven't
97.76 - had for a long time you open higher and
99.48 - go lower so this is a bull market
103.48 - phenomenon but we did study this because
105.88 - this is remember the best of
108.72 - 2024 and 2024 was a bull yes and on
112.92 - average the best time to buy the dip or
114.76 - manage a short position is around 10:30
118.16 - to 11:00 Eastern Standard time or that
121.16 - would be 9:15 right now MH to 10 central
128.12 - time it's when the market is weakest
131.04 - right now bat close your eyes and buy
132.68 - them this heat map shows weak in the
134.80 - morning strong in the afternoon for
136.56 - market indices and it shows the exact
138.36 - opposite for the vix The Greener The
141.36 - Greener the higher the price of the day
144.24 - so that's that's all that is just just
146.84 - um it's a heat map for all market
149.04 - indices in vix Futures the average
150.96 - 5minute percentile crosses around 12:55
153.72 - Eastern Standard Time which is noon in
155.96 - Chicago the vix surrenders around one
158.56 - Eastern stand time because they're
159.80 - inversely correlated this is noon in
162.60 - Chicago again this is why you got to be
166.36 - careful with those zero DTS and the
168.04 - upside risk at the end of the day in
169.68 - Bull markets and being long volatility
172.64 - going into the end of the day this is a
174.44 - U-shaped volume curve um in the middle
177.16 - of the day it's lowest and the market
180.56 - volume decelerates from morning to noon
182.32 - and then it re accelerates in the
183.52 - afternoon this was a fun piece and and
186.60 - that's why we like to trade when it's
189.24 - busiest morning and close but to be fair
192.36 - it doesn't matter much anymore let's go
193.96 - to the next slide it doesn't matter much
195.20 - anymore because of Technology yeah
197.08 - technology has kind of technology has
199.72 - has changed that game dramatically the
202.00 - possible theory behind the buy the dip
203.96 - morning momentum lighter volume easier
206.68 - accumulation nah I I know what they're
209.12 - writing here but I don't like it I think
212.12 - that the reason for it is is that it's a
215.36 - it's just simply a bull market
219.40 - phenomenon there's also an argument that
222.16 - there's macroeconomic data releases and
224.68 - that lighter volume means e easier uh
227.60 - accumulation but I'm not buying it um
231.40 - volatility tends to peak in the morning
233.00 - and decline in the afternoon fear is
235.00 - often overstated and as the day goes on
237.72 - people become less fearful it's like
239.32 - anything else you hop on a roller
241.80 - coaster you're scared to death once you
244.00 - get up to the top and you start going
245.44 - down you're like yeah it's nothing yeah
247.84 - hop in a wh Mo you're not so sure about
250.96 - what to expect there you go Si off you
253.44 - just did it yourself and you know what
255.80 - in the middle of the ride you forget
257.16 - you're even in a weo and by the end of
259.16 - the ride you say you know what I'm gonna
260.60 - do that
262.16 - again I'm not building any more bridges
265.40 - there you go this is a correlation heat
267.84 - map it's just a little a different way
269.96 - of looking at it um but it's the average
274.48 - price percent on the time confirms a
276.52 - weak a. and strong PM again this is a
279.32 - bull market pattern and don't think that
281.92 - it will last into perpetuity but until
285.04 - the market rolls over so far so good mhh
289.52 - and the inverse for volatility um in
292.24 - December we saw the vix and the market
296.60 - um act a little differently than it's
297.88 - acted the whole rest of the year the
299.44 - rest the year was really bullish and we
302.28 - didn't we basically didn't have a down
303.72 - tick all year but starting in December
306.04 - and we had a little bit more two-sided
307.44 - action and actually the Market's down a
309.72 - little bit for the last couple of weeks
312.00 - so that is true welcome to a two-sided
315.20 - Market a choppy December can we predict
317.44 - what's next not really but we know a
320.20 - couple things a we know that January
322.68 - tends to
323.76 - be among the highest volume months part
326.72 - of it's because of leap options part of
328.88 - it's because of people come back after
331.28 - you know they're all fired up and ready
332.92 - to go clean slate everything else um but
337.24 - January shows that the vix tends to be
338.96 - strongest around until around 10:15
342.24 - eastern time and then it gradually
344.12 - declines by
345.48 - 12:25 starting in January the vix is
347.96 - overtaken by all the major market
349.44 - indices and goes the opposite way that's
351.40 - just the same chars we've been showing
352.60 - all along really interesting though
355.00 - beautiful picture how about February
356.80 - along with November febru no along with
359.92 - November February is statistically one
361.96 - of the best months to buy the morning
363.48 - dip and here's a little just historical
366.44 - evidence to that these months often see
369.40 - the vixs morning Bluff early volatility
372.64 - fade creating opportunities over the
375.04 - last 10 or 15 years we've had some
377.64 - really nasty end of January early
380.60 - February of which the market has started
382.76 - off weak and finished strong the
384.88 - strongest average percentile of vixs
386.88 - five minute Bars by month and so we're
390.24 - looking you know again between that 10
392.20 - and 11:00 Eastern time or 9 to 10
394.88 - central time which is right where we are
397.28 - right now bullish Trend post 2008
399.76 - financial crisis yes we have been in a
402.44 - 15-year bull market of which you open
405.56 - lower and go higher that's just the way
407.20 - bull markets work every day they try to
409.36 - scare you a little bit and when the when
411.68 - when the fear runs out they they they
414.80 - buy them until your hands
416.56 - bleed um so timing of by the dip month
420.80 - specific strategies each month has its
423.76 - statistically best 5 minute bars and
426.52 - then low am high PM phenomenon the vix
431.16 - has the inverse but it has been very
435.56 - true from September to December and the
438.84 - best months for buying morning dips
442.08 - February May June and November I don't
444.16 - know how that's possible February May
446.16 - June and November who would have d
