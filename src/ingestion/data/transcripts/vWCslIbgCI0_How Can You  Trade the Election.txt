0.04 - I have a very strong opinion about the
1.64 - upcoming presidential election I know
3.48 - nobody knows how the market will react
5.64 - to the results is there a prer choice of
8.92 - product Andor strategy it seems like we
11.28 - are destined to fail no matter what
13.28 - happen that's not the question the
14.76 - question is is there a preferred choice
16.96 - of product and or strategy to trade the
20.16 - election anything that's liquid the
22.52 - election like I wouldn't do a sector bet
25.16 - I would do like an S&P bet or something
27.52 - like that if you wanted to or a bond bet
29.20 - or something like that it would be a
31.04 - highly Diversified big index product
33.72 - that would be my Preferred Choice if
35.36 - you're just trading the election results
37.16 - if I had a very strong opinion on the
38.96 - election and let's say I was bearish or
40.96 - bullish based on something happening I
42.88 - would probably buy a wide debit spread
44.92 - or sell out of the money wide credit
47.36 - spread
