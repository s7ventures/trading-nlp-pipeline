0.16 - the four most recognized us this is
2.88 - we're calling this trading the small cap
4.68 - index part one um we we decided to break
8.12 - this down because a lot of people like
9.76 - for example I'm long small
12.08 - caps I'm long the Russell short the S
14.48 - smps and I mean obviously it's nice this
18.56 - morning but um hasn't really been
21.24 - working that well um but we got a lot of
24.48 - questions about different indices so we
25.76 - decided to do a piece on the small cap
27.76 - index the Russell the foremost recogniz
30.36 - us Equity benchmarks are the S&P the
32.08 - NASDAQ the Russell and the Dow Jones
35.44 - while the Dow Jones is famous worldwide
37.64 - and the S&P is favored by uh by Traders
40.44 - for its focus on uh large cap companies
44.52 - um the the bottom line is that that the
48.36 - Russell like if I asked you to name a
51.28 - bunch of companies in the Russell it'd
52.52 - be hard for you yeah certainly would be
54.76 - yep totally agree I mean it'd be hard
56.44 - for any of us there's thousands of them
59.24 - 2,000 to be exact right um let's go next
65.08 - slide so the Russell 2000 is a crucial
69.40 - Benchmark for the US small cap stocks it
72.24 - serves as a comprehensive parameter of
74.92 - the smaller capitalization sector
76.84 - providing insight into the economic
78.36 - contributions of emerging Enterprises
80.76 - often in early stages of growth God that
83.68 - almost sounds like that was chat GPT
85.76 - let's go next slide
90.08 - despite its importance the Russell 2000
93.12 - has seen less discussion in recent years
96.68 - compared to other
98.20 - indexes um
100.76 - because it has been other indexes have
104.36 - outperformed the Russell by a lot sure
106.96 - it has been even the Dow Jones which is
109.84 - designed for conservative investors um
112.44 - for conservative returns with lower risk
114.40 - has outperformed the Russell the reason
116.28 - I'm L the Russell is because
117.24 - everything's outperformed it that's the
119.52 - bottom line yeah let's go next
124.48 - slide so this raises the question are
127.12 - small companies losing momentum or is
129.52 - there still an advantage to investing or
132.16 - trading in the Russell because you know
136.00 - we're kind of like we love to buy The
138.52 - Underdogs but for the last couple of
140.52 - years investing everybody has bought the
142.68 - leaders sure um so let's take a
148.32 - look go go next side so to explore this
152.56 - let's review the nature of small cap
154.64 - index the market cap of stocks in the
156.68 - Russell is significantly smaller than
157.96 - those of other indices to be included a
160.24 - stock must have a closing price of at
161.72 - least a dollar and a total market cap of
163.28 - at least 30
164.60 - million now remember we have some stocks
166.64 - now that are worth trillions sure So
169.04 - currently the stocks nor Russell have a
170.44 - much higher market cap than the minimum
172.12 - requirement ranging from um 3.9 billion
176.16 - to 92 billion um the top two weighted
179.52 - stocks are mstr at 92 billion and
182.72 - carvana cvna at 50
185.56 - billion
188.56 - um the majority though have are much
191.68 - smaller in scale less than 10 billion
194.60 - but I'm surprised the minimum is kind of
196.36 - around 3.9 billion that seems high to
199.20 - me but it is what it is okay so let's go
203.92 - to next
205.64 - slide so in comparison the total market
208.20 - cap of the S&P 500 is around 50 trillion
211.36 - while the Russell is less than one1 of
213.48 - that or around 5 trillion let's just say
216.64 - so From perspective Microsoft alone has
219.00 - a market cap of 3.5 trillion while the
221.24 - entire Russell is actually
224.96 - 3.4 so Microsoft should just buy every
227.72 - single stock in the Russell 2000 that
229.88 - makes sense that's what it's one way to
231.84 - look at it it's a big dog let's go next
236.92 - slide so despite the smaller size of
239.88 - component companies the Russell 2000
241.60 - itself is not significant the iwm is the
244.64 - seventh most actively traded Equity
246.92 - Equity index based on option trading
249.68 - notional value and it's not far behind
252.24 - cues um and we put it up here on the
255.84 - slide so looking at the 90-day notional
259.00 - value the Spy blows everything away um
262.44 - then comes Q's then comes iwm and Nvidia
266.16 - is Big Nvidia trades like the q's Nvidia
268.36 - Tesla trade like the q's they're always
270.48 - the top one two in option volume too
273.84 - yeah totally let's go next
279.52 - slide so the Russell 2000 represents
282.04 - seven several compelling opportunities
284.84 - first growth potential and and now this
288.28 - has not played out over the last couple
289.68 - of years but you would think that at
291.44 - some point it's got to pricing
294.20 - inefficiency um yeah they're a little
296.36 - little less little less liquid and and
299.76 - they are very sensitive to um more
303.52 - sensitive to domestic economic
305.28 - conditions because um they got less
308.80 - wiggle room they got a lot less wiggle
311.20 - room let's go next
317.76 - slide and so while small cap stocks have
320.20 - underperformed other indices recently
321.96 - they've shown better performances over
323.88 - the long run over the past 25 years the
325.76 - Russell 2000 has outperformed the Spy 14
329.00 - times 56% the NASDAQ 11 times and both
334.00 - together 10 times I'm kind of banking on
337.12 - that right now so the the median Ender
340.08 - return for the Russell is about
342.04 - 12.5% which surpasses the spies of 11.2
346.08 - although it hasn't been the case
347.36 - recently and here you can see it on a
348.80 - graph we we we just graphed everything
351.16 - out so you could take a look if you
352.76 - wanted to look at um I think this is the
355.68 - past 25
358.00 - years Prett good yeah yeah for sure it's
361.12 - a nice little graph next slide
363.76 - yeah next
367.08 - slide so some of the takeaways the
369.24 - Russell 2000 provides exposure to a
371.36 - broad range of small cap stocks across
373.04 - various
374.16 - Industries and it offers diversification
378.08 - for sure and growth like tasty is a
382.16 - small cap stock where a public traded
383.80 - small cap stock although the Russell
386.04 - 2000 hasn't performed well compared to
387.96 - other indices in recent years over the
390.00 - long term it
391.60 - has and it's also a really good pairs
394.12 - trading vehicle and that's one of the
395.36 - positions we have on right now we're
397.08 - trading the Russell in a pair versus the
398.92 - S smps you can trade it versus NASDAQ
401.00 - you can do whatever ratio you want it's
402.60 - all interesting
