0.08 - we we're calling this one exploring the
1.76 - probability of touch across various
4.44 - deltas and just remember what
6.28 - probability of a touch is it's the
8.48 - chance that between now and whenever
12.88 - expiration is that the option that you
16.04 - are trading touches the strike price and
19.08 - the back of the envelope way to to look
21.24 - at this is it's two times the Delta okay
24.40 - so this is we don't have to make this
25.92 - more complicated than it than it is it's
29.08 - essentially probability of a touch is
31.52 - two times the Delta but we decided to
33.76 - take a look at probability of a touch as
35.60 - it applies to calls and puts because in
38.32 - Bull markets you know the the the calls
42.68 - don't the the calls get touched more
44.88 - often than the puts let's take a look as
46.92 - we discussed that the realized
48.84 - probabilities of touching strikes in
50.64 - short option strategies is much lower
52.16 - than the theoretical probabilities this
54.32 - drops significantly when exiting
56.40 - positions at 21 days this is a piece
58.40 - that we did in the past so looking at 20
60.56 - Delta options here theoretical chance of
63.28 - a 20 Delta option touching puts and
65.40 - calls is two times the Delta so the
67.40 - Delta is 20 the theoretical chance of
69.36 - touching is 40 on the calls 40 on the
71.60 - puts if you hold it to expiration in the
74.40 - last 10 years because we've been in a
75.60 - bull market the puts actually only have
78.24 - a 20% chance of touching the calls right
80.44 - at 40 but if you manage early both sides
85.24 - where you think the theoretical is 40%
87.48 - it's really only 10 and 14 that's the
89.72 - whole concept the whole reason we manag
91.36 - early okay that's cool let's go to next
94.08 - slide but to understand the
95.36 - effectiveness of the realized
97.04 - probability touch we can examine the
98.96 - ratio between the realized probability
102.12 - Touch of 21 days and the Delta which is
104.12 - half of the theoretical probability
105.44 - touch I know these a lot of numbers but
107.24 - the reality is for options with a Delta
109.80 - of 20 the ratio is
113.32 - about3 on average so that's the coolest
117.32 - thing that when you manage early the
120.44 - ratio probability of a touch to it
123.20 - actually happening to whatever the
124.48 - theoretical is it's only about you know
128.12 - it's less than a third of the time and
129.76 - that's cool because remember the
131.80 - theoretical is 40% it's only 11 and 14
135.64 - so what happens here average is about
137.40 - three 310 of a percent essentially
140.64 - saying you know like there's no Edge in
144.96 - trading but there are these mechanical
148.36 - there's these things that you could
150.24 - understand about the mechanics of
152.04 - trading that are really interesting like
154.68 - if I said to you the chances of the
157.52 - market going down and touching a stock
160.16 - at a certain level is 40% if you sell
163.36 - the 20 Delta option but in reality okay
166.16 - if you manage early it's only 11% You'
168.52 - be like oh that's cool I'll do that AG
171.20 - that's all it is so let's go to the next
173.64 - slide um however focusing only on the 20
177.60 - Delta might not provide the full picture
179.56 - so this time we analyzed spy out of- the
182.68 - money puts and calls across various
184.20 - ranges from 10 to 45 which are the most
187.00 - commonly used out of the money Deltas
189.36 - all options were initiated 45 days and
191.44 - exited 21 days let's take a look at the
193.44 - put side first next slide please John so
197.12 - when we start to break it down um the
200.56 - probability of touch at expiration for
202.64 - all the Deltas are lower than the
203.92 - theoretical values two times the Delta
205.76 - but when the positions are managed at 21
207.52 - days the results improve significantly
209.28 - across all Deltas so did it really
211.52 - matter what Delta that we used and the
214.68 - answer is no it actually didn't and if
217.64 - you look at the actual probability of a
219.28 - touch uh 21 days divided by the Delta I
222.76 - mean these are in incredibly interesting
225.84 - numbers because essentially all of them
229.48 - are you know significantly below what
233.00 - the expectations are and and by the way
234.84 - we don't do 40 and 45 day options so so
237.56 - really looking at the further out of the
238.76 - money 10
241.32 - yeah you know obviously the at the money
242.88 - options are going to touch no matter
244.32 - what there's a 99% chance um unless you
247.60 - get the price action movement you know
250.52 - yeah right right right off the bat 100%
252.88 - yeah you're not going to sell a 50 Delta
254.56 - option expect it to only hit you know
256.68 - it's it's going to 100% it's almost like
258.68 - when you put on a position you know your
260.92 - p&l is typically zero or negative a few
264.40 - pennies per contract you know rarely is
266.80 - it you know POS the value of this study
269.76 - the value of this study is for out of
271.08 - the money options it's not for 40 and 45
273.40 - and 50 Deltas it's only for out of the
275.32 - money options y a graph makes it easier
277.72 - to see the Improvement that expiring
280.08 - that exiting positions early can bring
281.72 - to our short putut strategy the trend
283.84 - also shows that the gap between
285.36 - theoretical and realized pot pot Narrows
288.80 - as the Delta increases indicating a
290.36 - higher risk of touching with larger
291.68 - Delta options of course and that just
293.88 - you know common sense but really where
295.80 - we are in that 15 20 25 area you can see
299.72 - the actual vers the um the theoretical
304.28 - in purple the actual at expiration in
307.56 - blue and then the and then green which
310.60 - is when you manage early so now we look
312.84 - at the call side which is going to be a
314.04 - little bit different it's higher than
315.72 - the puts but it also is surprisingly low
320.96 - if you manage early so again what we're
323.44 - seeing here is results that are very
325.64 - similar and um you can see a 10 15 20
330.24 - and 25 Deltas the the actual probability
333.64 - of touch at 21 days to expiration is
336.48 - still a very small percentage of what
340.92 - the theoretical would be you know 3% 7%
344.48 - 14 24 let's go to the next slide so we
347.44 - found a similar pattern in the graph and
350.68 - again positions become less effective
352.68 - when you have the higher Deltas but the
354.56 - lower Delta positions you can see how
356.28 - effective they are just look at the
357.32 - green compared to the theoretical and
359.44 - the actual it's very impressive very
361.64 - much got to manage early we've been
363.76 - talking about this and you know uh you
366.56 - you always remember when you don't
368.04 - manage early you never remember uh when
370.88 - you manage early and it works out it
372.52 - would have worked out perfectly for you
373.96 - so manage early I think managing early
376.04 - 45 days we've said it numerous times
377.88 - that's putting on trades that's been two
379.92 - keys to flatten out my p&l curve 100% s
383.48 - I'm going to take a quick 90c break when
384.92 - come back we got wait one second oh I'm
386.64 - sorry I did the takeway I apologize yeah
388.76 - so for index options puts have a lower
391.36 - actual pop not pop pot probability to
394.64 - touch than calls across all Deltas
396.80 - managing the positions at 21dt
398.80 - significantly reduces the chances of
400.36 - being tested strikes compared to doing
402.04 - nothing on average the realized
404.52 - probability to touch on the put side is
406.04 - slightly smaller than the Delta while it
408.72 - is almost the same on the call side and
411.08 - the difference between put and call
412.56 - sides become marginal when the positions
414.92 - are managed so manager
