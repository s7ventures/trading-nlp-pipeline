0.20 - is this the end of BPR breaking losses
4.76 - what does that mean BPR breaking losses
6.60 - let's take a look before 2020 there was
9.36 - never there was never a loss on an early
12.08 - managed 16 Delta strangle in the Spy
14.56 - that exceeded the initial buying power
16.20 - requirement including
18.24 - 2008 H that's pretty interesting the
21.08 - worst case as a percent of initial
23.32 - buying power reduction before 2020 of a
25.96 - trade happened in 2009 with the trade's
28.48 - loss of 21 days to expiration closing at
30.64 - 56% of the initial buying power
32.80 - reduction spy in 2020 we experienced the
35.80 - first loss that breached the buying
37.08 - power reduction before the 21-day DT
39.44 - Mark that was 1.1 times 110% of the
43.08 - initial buying power that shows you how
46.28 - good how strong that number is for
50.20 - really being able to predict kind of
52.64 - like you know maximum risk okay yep in
56.92 - 2024 markets across all assets have had
60.00 - some big swings and this is trans
63.68 - translated into some sharp losses any
65.28 - single but has this translated sharp
67.08 - losses on any single trade similar to
70.24 - 2009 or 2020 we're talking about risk
74.00 - right now is buying is the BPR really
77.48 - the Beall end all for what your losses
80.68 - can be that's the real question here
83.88 - let's go to the next
85.08 - slide so we looked at the spies The Q's
88.04 - TLT and gold that's PS NASDAQ bonds and
91.76 - gold we looked at these since the
93.84 - beginning of the year beginning of this
96.24 - year we observed the worst losses I mean
99.32 - we're basically 11 months in we observed
102.08 - the worst losses for short 16 Delta
106.04 - strangles we computed the magnitude of
108.32 - each product's Works loss relative to
110.00 - the buying power on this trade just for
111.64 - the last year so this is like looking
113.68 - back at kind of something similar to
115.16 - what we do for you know uh buying power
118.24 - reduction that kind of I'm I'm sorry
119.92 - similar what we do for context of like
122.04 - ivr going back 12 you know 50 52 weeks
126.44 - but let's take a look so go to next
129.08 - Slide
130.24 - John so despite 2024 being a tough year
134.04 - to trade for many reasons and you know
135.84 - what to be fair every year is tough yes
138.84 - every year has its hurdles there's no
140.68 - such thing as this was that even it
142.04 - doesn't have hurdles volatility just
143.68 - collapses or it stays too low sure yeah
146.44 - I don't like that line because there's
148.24 - never been an easy year since I've been
150.80 - in this business since
153.40 - 1983 for me you know what the easiest
156.48 - year of my entire career was I don't
159.44 - know
160.92 - 1985 why because I didn't have like for
164.96 - some reason that entire year I didn't
167.96 - just hit on all cylinders I just hit on
169.20 - all cylinders I don't even think I had a
170.40 - losing week that year in 1985 and I made
173.08 - a crazy amount I was so you peaked at 85
175.44 - is basically what you're saying I I got
177.04 - it 28 years old and I peaked 40 years
179.68 - ago ago listen most people peak in high
182.64 - school you you know if you got to look
184.60 - at you know one floor the ceiling peed
186.68 - in 85 you peaked in 85 I peak in 87 not
190.72 - too not too long after you 87 was a good
192.80 - year too yeah yeah okay I think I peaked
194.76 - an 85 though I could have peaked in 87
196.64 - one of the
197.60 - two uh that's not bad because you're
200.76 - right I mean most people in high school
204.20 - yeah yeah yeah some people don't even
205.48 - get to peek in high school despite 2024
208.56 - being a tough year for many reason
210.40 - the BPR of a naked short premium trade
212.44 - seemed to carry sizable buffer beyond
215.32 - the worst losses for each asset tested
217.40 - this year we have seen the worst losses
219.96 - between 9 and 24% I would have thought
222.52 - August 5th would have been bigger so$ 16
225.56 - Del to strangle the worst loss in 2024
227.40 - as a percent of buying power spy 9% Q's
230.76 - 24% TLT yeah those numbers seem they
233.76 - seem low to me year-to dat performance
236.80 - yeah you know what I would have thought
238.08 - wouldn't you think August 5th would have
239.32 - been bigger than that yeah but I've been
242.56 - wrong before I know I you don't have to
246.08 - say it that way many times but I would
248.52 - have thought August 5th would have been
250.20 - bigger throughout 2024 the implied
252.28 - volatility across all asset classes
254.20 - consistently ranged between 15 and 25%
256.36 - on average as a result the break evens
258.48 - for nearly all short premium positions
260.04 - have been quite broad with it which is a
262.60 - significant factor in presenting extreme
264.52 - losses I will say that we did have in
268.48 - 2024 we had this one crazy move on the
271.84 - morning of August 5th where we exploded
275.20 - to about 45 legit 40 you know 45ish in
279.24 - implied volatility by the next day we
280.80 - were back down in the in the low 30s you
283.76 - know low 30s but we did have one
286.04 - explosion it was a Friday Monday which
289.36 - completely reversed by Tuesday um which
292.84 - is crazy
294.80 - but which is another reason why it's so
298.12 - difficult even if you buy protection
300.72 - against that kind of move because
302.48 - there's no way you could have got
306.16 - out there's no way you could have got
308.00 - out on when do you lift your hedge again
309.92 - right I mean that's because because how
311.12 - you going to lift your hedge what if
312.32 - they go down the next day right you
313.72 - don't know sure but it's easy to cherry
315.84 - pick yeah so in 2024 so far the worst
319.40 - loss of a short premium is percent of
320.88 - buying power moderate with the worst
323.24 - Market being the q's which total 24% of
326.36 - the trade's initial buying power when
328.44 - implied that's because we came back into
330.36 - play when implied volatility is high
332.88 - it's rare to see a loss exceed the
334.64 - buying power since break evens a very
336.16 - wide start I agree but John can you do
338.24 - me a favor can you go back to this slide
341.00 - too I just want to see did they wait
343.24 - till right there okay so this is the
346.52 - reason that August 5th I couldn't figure
348.20 - out why August 5th didn't show up here
350.04 - here's the reason because we observed
352.68 - the worst losses for 45 days managed at
356.76 - 21 days so they didn't have to
360.64 - cover the August 5th the bacle on August
364.52 - 5th 6 7th rightly so because don't don't
367.24 - email me because I I I was like there
369.92 - had to be a way worse loss on August 5th
373.68 - but assuming that you did it just by the
376.80 - sold a 45 days managed a 21 days so that
380.56 - part is a little bit misleading just to
382.80 - put it out there because there was a
384.76 - moment of panic on that you know
388.56 - August second and 5ifth
391.12 - mhm yeah third was Saturday fourth was
393.92 - yeah yeah so third and fourth were the
396.12 - weekend so the 2 and the 5ifth and so
398.76 - there was a moment of panic when the
400.20 - numbers were much higher than that but
402.32 - then if you waited till 21 days when you
404.04 - actually make the adjustment there was
405.36 - it was nothing at all okay that's fair
