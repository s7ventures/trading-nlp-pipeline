0.20 - what's up everybody Welcome to the life
2.60 - cycle of a trade the series where we
5.08 - break down the thought process behind
7.44 - trade entry trade adjustments and
10.44 - closing order in this video we are going
13.28 - to cover an iron
16.21 - [Music]
19.48 - fly I'm looking at a trade that I don't
22.00 - do a ton of and it's because it's a very
24.92 - slow moving trade but you really need to
26.64 - be uh High volatility underlying for
29.32 - this sort of trade trade I'm looking at
31.32 - paler and I'm thinking maybe an iron fly
34.48 - sets up nicely here so if you look at
36.36 - paler it's a stock that has absolutely
39.52 - exploded to the upside it's very much a
42.48 - um has had a lot of social Buzz to it to
45.96 - say the least uh I'm looking at this
48.12 - implied volatility of almost 70% implied
51.60 - volatility when you get into the
52.64 - earnings expiration which is out in
54.52 - February you got in the 80 handle
56.64 - implied volatility so very high implied
58.92 - volatility stock has come down a tiny
61.40 - bit and and the biggest issue here for
64.24 - this stock is that it's got a little bit
66.96 - higher margin requirement because of how
69.40 - high that volatility is if you were to
70.96 - do a strangle here naked it would use
73.44 - about 2500 bucks in buying power which
75.60 - is too big of a position for my account
78.08 - so for me I'm going to look to do an
80.48 - iron fly which is a straddle right at
83.52 - the money the 70 strike stradle you can
85.56 - see a big credit of $10 and change but
87.96 - uses a lot of buying power and then
90.28 - we're going to buy the wings just to cap
92.72 - the amount of buying power that we're
94.08 - using here we're going to want to reduce
96.16 - this down to you know somewhere around
99.00 - $1,000 maybe a little bit less than
101.00 - $1,000 here so I'm going to go here
103.84 - I'mma buy 15. wide wings so we're going
107.12 - to look at the 55
108.96 - strike for the long option on the on the
111.88 - put side and we're going to go to the 85
114.28 - on the call side you'll see this sets up
116.84 - with a pop that's 42% and that's because
119.56 - your buying those wings your your risk
121.88 - profile is within the expected move here
124.08 - so it's a a lower probability trade but
126.96 - you're playing into what is a 60 IV Rank
129.48 - and almost a 70% implied volatility so
131.84 - you have a lot of volatility baked in to
134.28 - this position to give you some context
136.56 - if this tra if this underlying were to
139.04 - see a five or 10 point drop in
142.12 - volatility this spread would certainly
145.08 - certainly be profitable assuming that
147.24 - the stock stays somewhere around this um
150.28 - this Mark here somewhere inside the
152.24 - expected move which you would expect if
154.48 - if you get a volatility contraction so
157.60 - we're going to Route this at an
159.08 - $852 credit we'll see if we get filled
161.44 - here for this kind of 5050 High Vol play
165.00 - that we're looking for in
167.08 - paler we'll do it at here those markets
169.80 - are moving so I'm gonna move this to 845
172.16 - see if we get p filled a penny
174.88 - above mid price we actually got price
177.44 - improved to 856 on this iron fly so
181.04 - we're looking for a move between 60 and
183.64 - 80 over the next 37 days for this to be
186.92 - profitable we'll see if that happens but
188.60 - stick around CU we're going to do some
189.96 - Management on this
193.84 - TR we've had some two-sided action the
196.64 - stock has gone uh from you know the 70
200.40 - handle up to 85 we're back to 75 here so
203.60 - we've gone $5 in the money on the call
206.32 - side of course no problem with
208.68 - assignment here lots of extrinsic value
211.12 - in a stock like this a high volatility
213.04 - stock moving stock a stock that moves a
215.72 - lot dayto day so no issues there we do
219.08 - have 15 days to go till expiration which
221.44 - is getting down to the last part of the
223.56 - expiration you can see we've got about
225.72 - $3 of extrinsic value on this position
228.64 - the way we can look at that is just by
230.12 - taking the put strike which is let's
232.16 - call it about a$ 130ish and then the in
234.68 - the money call strike is actually going
236.28 - to have the same amount of extrinsic
237.92 - value as that out of the money put so
239.96 - $2.50 or 60 is what I have left to make
243.64 - on this position if the stock stays
245.88 - right where it is and the stock has
247.96 - actually rallied significantly uh in the
250.84 - last hour or so when I was looking at
252.60 - this position you could see we move from
254.48 - 73 to 75 I'm looking at my p&l values
257.32 - and we're looking at about $120 profit
260.44 - at the early part of the session this
262.12 - morning uh but that has since eroded a
265.20 - little bit but still doesn't take away
266.80 - from the message here um so anyway with
269.72 - 15 days to go till expiration the
272.40 - decision now is to either close the
274.16 - position or roll into either the same
277.28 - position in the in the further out
278.88 - expiration or a new position you could
280.44 - go to do multiple different things here
282.96 - for me I think it's just a close take
285.04 - some money and run on this position uh
287.24 - it's one that when we got up to 85 which
289.40 - was basically the high of the Year 8480
292.32 - this was a losing position now we've had
294.44 - a little bit of a pullback we're making
296.24 - some money on the position I think it's
298.04 - time to just take the profits and move
300.12 - on to another position so to close out
302.36 - of this position one of the things that
303.80 - I I make sure I look at is to make sure
306.16 - there's a bid and an ask on the long
309.00 - options if there isn't you want to just
311.08 - remove those options from the closing
312.88 - order because they have no value but
314.92 - there is value in these about eight or
317.12 - nine cents on the downside so if we can
319.96 - get H filled here for a little bit less
322.24 - than the mid price let's see if we can
323.68 - get 85 C profit here which would be
326.72 - 761 fill price on this
331.32 - no fill there go up to
334.40 - 65 no fill there and you'll see that
337.24 - within the money options your there we
339.56 - go we got filled as we were talking but
341.16 - in the money options you'll see your bid
342.84 - ass spread be much wider than the out of
346.12 - out of the money options and thus you
347.88 - know it makes it hard to fill um you
350.60 - might have to adjust the price a little
352.00 - bit above or below the mid price
353.68 - depending on if you're buying or selling
355.24 - so anyway we routed that closing order
357.80 - 765 debit Nets us out an $881 profit but
361.60 - really the key here was that we had a
363.08 - little bit of a sideways move here or at
365.04 - least ended up as a sideways move uh
367.40 - throughout the duration of the trade
