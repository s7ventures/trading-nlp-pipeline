0.08 - S&P is turned green y 12 yeah yeah
3.64 - Russell turn green it's up 10 cents
6.44 - there you go implied volatility
10.08 - overstatement with and profit targets
12.84 - with strangles oh boy this is heavy kids
16.60 - get your helmet on as premium sellers
19.64 - one of the main ways we profits through
20.96 - implied volatility overstatement meaning
23.04 - that realized VA is lower than implied
25.68 - Val we've done many studies in the past
27.84 - discussing the benefits of IV
29.20 - overstatement finding that IV was
31.64 - overstated 75 to 80% of the time
33.88 - depending on the time frame in this
36.00 - study we're going to dive into the
37.44 - effects of implied volatility on
39.12 - strangles exploring quick profits how
42.36 - quickly profits can be achieved and when
45.28 - we receive the
47.12 - most so it's going back to that 50 50%
50.76 - or 21 days high vers low all the above
54.08 - let's go next
56.28 - slide 12 years of research the reason we
60.04 - pick different time frames is just how
63.36 - much stuff we can we can basically just
67.08 - churn our way through in you know the
69.48 - last 24 hours this stuff's all done like
72.28 - pretty much the day before
74.28 - mhm so we looked at the strangles of
77.48 - various Deltas at 45 days managed at 21
80.52 - DT or 50% depending on the slide we
83.44 - bucketed the trades based on various
84.96 - implied volatilities over under 18
87.60 - where's the vix right now the vix is it
90.60 - over 18 or under uh VI is trading at
94.08 - 1731 down 60 forward SL VX so this was
97.96 - we were right at the cut off this
99.24 - morning yeah 18 yep or last night's
101.32 - close yeah last night's close right
102.96 - we're just under it right now then we
105.40 - answered the following questions what is
107.08 - the effect of implied volatility on
108.56 - strangles how many days until we hit the
110.72 - most profit what are the effects of
112.68 - managing at 21 vers 50 21 days vers 50%
116.52 - and how does implied volatility impact
118.28 - our profit targets want a
121.12 - guess there's a lot of questions in here
124.12 - okay let me ask you one by one how does
126.28 - implied volatility impact profit targets
128.56 - I'll give you a hint by a percentage
130.20 - basis higher higher is better yeah of
132.36 - course I would have thought that I just
133.48 - don't know what percentage how many days
134.80 - until we hit the most profit 21 three
137.52 - three weeks within three weeks three
139.16 - weeks Tony says what are the effects of
141.00 - managing a 21 DT versus 50% what are the
144.16 - effects on the p&l I'm going to assume
145.92 - yes I think it's actually going to be
148.08 - better higher high at 21 days than
152.48 - 50% okay and um I have no idea I could
156.28 - be completely wrong on this I'm not
157.68 - positive about anything and what is the
159.52 - effect of implied volatility on
160.68 - strangles well I'm going to tell you
161.68 - right now that is going to be higher
162.92 - credits sure sure entry is the only
165.36 - thing you can control it's the only
166.60 - thing that we know for sure yep y okay
169.24 - let's see what we got so we start off
171.04 - with the theoretical pop for selling
173.24 - options is calculated by taking one
175.12 - minus the Delta of the
176.60 - option so if you have strangles it's
179.44 - then one minus 2 times the Delta because
181.96 - you you're selling two options right so
184.60 - if you sell a 20 Delta strangle the
187.48 - theoretical pop is 60% that's 1 minus 2
191.88 - * 20 1 - 40 is 60 right yeah people get
196.08 - a little confused thinking it's closer
197.36 - to 80% when they do that CU they're
198.84 - doing a 20 Delta option the theoretical
200.72 - Pop might be 60 but the actual Pop might
202.80 - be closer to 80 sure let's go next
207.60 - Slide the actual win rate was much
210.56 - higher than the theoretical pop due to
212.12 - the initial credit because also when you
214.40 - collect initial credit you have to
215.92 - subtract the credit from the numbers
217.20 - it's going to be a lot higher in high
219.52 - implied volatility the win rate was
220.80 - nearly identical to all occurrences but
223.60 - the return on Capital was was or the
226.44 - double right it's almost like
227.92 - probability of touch being almost twice
229.76 - as much as the Delta like you know you
231.16 - look at a 20 Delta option you say what's
232.76 - the you know this is so far out of the
234.68 - money I got an 80% pop here you know
236.52 - there nothing is ever going to happen
237.96 - but you got basically a 40% chance of
239.80 - touch so if you look at all occurrences
241.96 - and you look at the 20 Delta options the
244.24 - actual win rate was 76 the theoretical
246.84 - is 60 so it's 16% higher which is big
251.68 - but if you look at a high implied
252.96 - volatility which is over 18 it was 78
255.84 - and that's the world we live in um so
259.16 - that 78 is is a big number well the wind
262.36 - rate changes that's why they highlighted
263.88 - there wind rate Chang even greater by
266.64 - these the average return on capital is
268.56 - is better too yes the win rate's good I
270.76 - mean the I meant the average return on
272.20 - capital is is much better too when it's
273.84 - higher IV that's what I'm trying to say
275.16 - in higher IV you're 30% above the
277.84 - theoretical pop and your average return
280.12 - on capital is 4.2% so look at that win
282.64 - rate with high IV 76 to 78 I mean that's
285.76 - I mean that's I know statistically
287.76 - that's nice that's like splitting
289.52 - pennies for me but doubling the average
291.72 - return on Capital now you're talking
293.04 - money now you're talking to me now
294.44 - you're talking to me baby higher implied
296.16 - volatility make more money let's go to
297.56 - next slide so in high implied vol not
300.20 - only is more credit collected but the
302.56 - p&l tends to be higher as a percentage
304.96 - of that credit so when the IV is high
307.28 - there are less dramatic swings in p&l
309.12 - from the trade to trade even with
311.24 - further out of- the- money strangles so
313.48 - we'll stay at that 20 Delta p&l has a
316.72 - percent of the credit if it's in hi 23%
320.76 - and p&l volatility drops to 71 and you
323.88 - can see how dramatic that is against all
325.88 - occurrences you collect more money and
328.92 - you have smaller volatility swings
331.84 - that's the cool thing yes sir and it
333.96 - stays that way throughout the entire
335.60 - process lower p&l volatility higher p&l
340.00 - as percent of the credit okay so here we
343.88 - look at the average number of days until
345.76 - hitting the most profit you said 21 the
349.08 - actual turned out to be 17 I was going
351.80 - to say side 21 is what I said but yeah I
354.00 - get it roughly 2 and A2 weeks after
355.84 - trade entry approximately 28% of the
358.68 - occurrences saw the highest profits come
361.00 - between the first and second week after
363.60 - trade entry I was really just
365.24 - piggybacking old research that we've
367.04 - done here we said that if trades are
369.72 - going to work they typically work with
371.56 - inside three weeks which is really
373.28 - staying true uh here too which is great
375.80 - so a lot of times when people want to
378.04 - avoid earnings and they're looking to
379.68 - put on an a trade with a stock that has
382.40 - earnings if they send me an email they
383.84 - go is this a decent trade I say you know
385.68 - what earnings aren't for four or five
387.24 - weeks if the trade's going to work it's
388.56 - going to work within three weeks sure go
390.56 - ahead put it on I don't think you're
391.44 - going to get too affected as volatility
393.24 - does increase for earnings about two
394.72 - weeks before the earnings so yeah that
397.20 - that that that that fudges it that meets
399.20 - the the criteria I like it well this is
401.96 - a really good statistic because
404.08 - 68% of the days with the most profit
407.36 - occurred before managing a 21 days M you
411.20 - think I'm not listening over here I know
412.52 - you call me silly a couple times and
413.88 - stuff like that but you know we're
415.44 - idiotic and stuff like that but I'm I
417.32 - got two ears and I can't close them
418.88 - although I'd like to sometimes like my
420.84 - eyes I can close those and I do that
422.40 - often while we're on the show I can't
423.80 - let's go to the next slide Beth I don't
424.96 - close my ears so I do pay attention 16
427.60 - Delta strangles hitting the the day is
431.08 - hitting the most profit 50% profit for
433.68 - 20 days this is interesting too managing
435.80 - at 50% profit led to faster profits than
438.92 - managing at 21 days now I manage at 21
441.00 - days you know I mean I manage all the
443.84 - time but 21 days is kind of my
445.52 - wheelhouse led to faster profits than
447.68 - managing in 21 days by roughly three 3
449.72 - days however in average the p&l was 20%
452.60 - smaller when managed at 50% so basically
455.80 - the 21dt versus the 50% is
460.80 - pretty it's it's they're pretty much the
463.32 - same thing you make more money if you
465.96 - manage 21 days you get to manage faster
468.60 - if you manage 50% according to the
471.08 - research I think it's 6f what you know
474.08 - six of one half dozen another it doesn't
476.52 - even though I got it right I would say
478.40 - you are correct it's six of one half
480.44 - dozen of another you know what if you
481.92 - make that 50% so quickly you're probably
484.56 - going to look to take take it off and
486.20 - not let it run to have a higher gain and
489.16 - then a lot of times when you reach 50%
490.48 - it might come back the other direction
491.64 - too so I think for p&l volatility of
495.24 - your of your of your portfolio just the
497.88 - curve of how it behaves I think taking
499.96 - the profits is prudent so this one is
502.28 - the P the median pnl rose with
504.84 - increasing implied volatility to the
506.52 - volatility is mean reverting nature so
508.80 - this one is really interesting because
510.32 - this is the 50% profit Target so days to
512.28 - reach 50% profit Target didn't decrease
514.88 - with higher implied volatility because
516.36 - of the increased initial credit only in
519.08 - the 50 to 75 range which doesn't really
521.56 - happen that often um so when you look at
524.12 - this the ivr range for 16 Delta
526.52 - strangles we're usually in that 25 to 50
529.04 - that that second tier the 50 to 75 is
532.36 - kind of rare um and the days here in
534.64 - this trade are about
536.12 - 17 and the median p l is about 76 and
539.24 - the initial credit about 182 that makes
542.48 - a lot of sense that's the way that's
544.52 - kind of where we mostly live in that
548.08 - range let's go to the last
551.64 - slide
553.36 - so pretty the pretty expected takeaways
557.92 - in high implied volatility increasing
560.96 - strangle Delta maintains win rates and
563.52 - doubles the return on Capital with the
565.52 - 20 to 30 Delta strangles providing the
567.24 - best return on Capital and a reduction
569.16 - in P
570.24 - volatility another thing to look at is
572.28 - the days in a trade rather than the days
573.88 - to expiration for 16 Delta strangles
576.60 - exiting at 17 days post entry maximizes
580.20 - profits while early management can hurt
582.80 - long time long-term PR Health but
585.04 - managing a 50% profit speeds up the
587.84 - profits compared to 21dt but results in
590.56 - lower average p&l as increased
592.28 - volatility doesn't necessarily Quicken
594.80 - gains due to the initial credit
596.92 - adjustments I find it way easier after
600.36 - you make all the adjustments just to
601.96 - manage 21 days
