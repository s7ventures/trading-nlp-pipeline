0.04 - here's some predefined intervals that
1.68 - you can choose from on the new back
3.16 - testing tab on tasty what I like about
6.40 - this is that there are different times
8.92 - throughout you know Market history where
11.36 - we've definitely had some some crazy
13.20 - events and it's hard for people to
15.12 - remember just because we have nothing
17.36 - else to do in our lives and we can't
18.96 - remember our own kids' birthdays but we
20.68 - can remember like the pandemic sell off
23.76 - I mean I'm not saying that's a good
25.44 - thing or whatever but at least there's

160.72 - bare Market on the interval chosen was
163.20 - the inflation induced bare Market from
165.40 - January to October of 2022 that was a
168.40 - pretty
170.12 - decent uh that was a pretty decent
172.36 - selloff I mean that was a pretty
174.52 - negative year pretty decent selloff um
177.64 - spy 45 days to expiration 30 Delta short
180.88 - putut 50 Delta short putut and the 20 30
184.68 - Delta short putut spread so what you're

201.08 - with this back testing softare exactly
202.68 - these software is so easy you can modify
205.48 - to any extent you want you can manage a
208.12 - you can manage a 50 uh percent of profit
211.36 - you can manage everything you want
213.60 - beautiful let's go to the next
216.20 - slide okay so and this might be a little
220.84 - hard to read for people I have another
223.12 - version right in front of me but um uh
226.64 - hopefully you can hopefully it looks you
228.44 - can see it um take us through what you
231.68 - have here Gad um the results of the
234.64 - strategy in terrible market conditions
237.76 - yeah so sorry so when you go to these
240.52 - terrible uh be market conditions you see
242.88 - short 50 short ports it you show
245.32 - negative if you go to pnl Total pnl yeah
248.60 - it's almost like 4500 negative if you go
252.32 - to 30 Port 23 negative yeah 2300
257.12 - negative if you go to 20 3020 Delta uh
260.84 - short put trade and you put this 204 the
264.08 - protections you will see uh almost 100
267.84 - negative uh to uh pnl this Trace how bad
274.24 - this Market was this is for the total
277.80 - year right total year yeah this is not
280.60 - for trade basis this is everything
282.48 - combined everything combined yeah if you
285.04 - combine everything this Market in this
286.80 - interval this what you
289.08 - got yeah okay I got it and if you go to
292.76 - the next average also a p per
295.72 - trade no go back Beth one second so the
299.44 - first one total yeah the first one's
301.44 - total the second one's average per trade
303.40 - trade the max drw Downs these are new
306.44 - new uh features we added on back testing
309.44 - which will show you um how that your
312.64 - marks your percentage marks draw Downs
315.44 - so what's interesting here is that if
317.44 - you sold this put spread long short the
319.92 - 30 Delta long the 20 Delta you lost $224
322.52 - per trade but if you did it
326.76 - and and you sold the $3 put it's only4
329.72 - $165 per trade it almost feels like you
333.16 - won even though you
334.76 - lost well you only lost
337.56 - 22% um of return you know your return on
340.44 - Capital was NE 22% when the other ones
342.88 - were minus almost 40 4 yeah that's
344.80 - pretty interesting that's my take away
346.08 - from that all right now let's go next
347.36 - page
348.56 - Beth so the bull market same exact thing
351.68 - right
352.88 - exactly and this is the post-pandemic
355.04 - Surge from it's basically may20 to
360.92 - yeah uh same thing so now we're going to
362.72 - look at the exact opposite opposite yeah
366.68 - let's go here Beth next
369.28 - slide okay if you go straight to the
371.88 - return on Capital you will see that data
374.12 - put it's over
376.32 - 100 return on Capital if you go to 30
379.60 - data put it's 69 or 70 and if you go to
383.64 - Delta 30 and you put 20 for the
386.44 - protection it will be 136
389.92 - uh percent return on Capital these on
393.12 - the side of the bull market when the
395.80 - market is good so what do you
398.80 - expect I
400.88 - mean based on this I can't believe S&P
404.72 - are up nine points now I know wow what a
407.40 - little turnaround hasda up
409.36 - 97 um not sure what just happened but
413.40 - interesting
416.56 - um what my my takeaway from this is
421.40 - if you sold the 30 Delta puts regardless
423.40 - of the market condition you did way
425.20 - better better in the bull market than
426.68 - you did bad in the in the bare Market
429.08 - the bare Market exactly so the strategy
431.72 - is just sell 30 Delta puts and close
433.24 - your eyes
434.04 - forever and remember there's no
436.48 - management there's no Management in
438.48 - these strategies you just put there with
441.44 - the whole risk in included yeah I mean
445.00 - it's really interesting that you know
447.52 - how it it really the
450.60 - losses were a fraction of the gains MH
455.32 - exactly you know um in in both periods
458.20 - that's that's pretty damn interesting um
460.96 - and this one of the importance of this
463.28 - uh back testing tool it will show you
466.32 - all as I said both angles I mean both
468.44 - Corners in bare Market what will you
471.48 - expect to get in your portfolio as
473.64 - return in bu Market what do you expect
475.92 - to get in in your portfolio as return
479.12 - capital
481.20 - got it okay let's go to the last slide
484.04 - Beth takeaways the back testing tool
486.40 - allows users to simulate and evaluate
488.96 - various trading strategies using
491.00 - historical data by identifying
492.36 - strategies that perform well in
493.76 - challenging conditions Traders can build
496.16 - more resilient portfolios and using

501.92 - comprehensive view of the strategies uh
504.16 - it gives you a comprehensive view of the
505.60 - strategy's potential Effectiveness and
508.00 - again like I said my main takea away
509.80 - from this was just that in the bare
512.08 - Market you lost money in the bull market
513.32 - you made money but you made three times
514.52 - as much money so wasn't that bad um
