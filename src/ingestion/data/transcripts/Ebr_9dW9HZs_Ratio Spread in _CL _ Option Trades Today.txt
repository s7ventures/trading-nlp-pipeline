0.20 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.36 - the bat Batista right here in downtown
4.24 - Chicago right here in the Batcave we're
6.48 - going to come at you with a nice little
8.00 - trade on 1010 the Tesla numbers coming
12.72 - out today after the close but I'm not
14.40 - going to go to Tesla today I'm going to
16.12 - do something a little bit different I'm
17.24 - going to show you something I think is
19.28 - very interesting and a nice way to look
20.92 - at volatility in oil related products
23.76 - hey first let's take a quick look at the
25.28 - market Ean S&P is down
27.92 - $13 NASDAQ down $36 and change Russell
33.08 - the weakest of the group down almost 1%
36.00 - continues to be weak uh down $21 in
38.76 - change and the Dow down 120 I said just
42.36 - now that the that the Russell is the
44.00 - weakest of the group and uh comparing to
46.40 - some of the other uh indices if you take
48.88 - a look here at the Russell Ean S&P graph
52.72 - you'll notice here that it's at an
54.96 - extreme it's about as low as it's been
57.04 - that's a onetoone relationship between
59.48 - being long Russell short &ps or long the
63.84 - Russell stocks versus short the &ps if
68.00 - you change this uh to NASDAQ it will
70.20 - show you the same thing for SL NQ if you
74.24 - look at that you'll notice that it's
75.60 - almost at the same extreme not quite as
77.80 - large I don't have that position on I
80.00 - wouldn't look to put that position on
81.52 - but it is interesting for people that
83.56 - are looking uh for divergences in
86.52 - markets that might think hey maybe it's
88.76 - time to buy the the Russell here a
90.36 - little bit I personally don't think it's
92.88 - that time but there is something to take
95.12 - a look at in oil oil up a137 today and
99.60 - you'll notice that the ivy rank is quite
102.00 - High here at 89 it's about as high as
104.16 - it's been in recent uh history here as
107.44 - the product is pretty much range bound
111.12 - uh especially the higher end up around
113.92 - 82 now oil always has a call skew to it
119.36 - and what's call skew let's take a look
121.08 - at these November options we like to go
123.40 - closest to 45 days the mechanics don't
125.96 - change whether you're trading uh Futures
128.96 - options or Equity uh options now let's
132.32 - take a look at what I was just saying a
133.44 - moment ago about you know closest uh
136.40 - call skew how far you can go from the
138.16 - closest to at the money let's just say
140.16 - 74 a half or 75 uh is the at the money
144.92 - uh strike right now even though you're
146.28 - looking at the future at 74 that's the
149.12 - one you're Trading remember when you're
150.88 - trading Futures options you're always
153.28 - trading the future that's represented in
155.52 - your months you'll notice right here
157.00 - this future the Z4 is trading at $74 the
161.96 - future that's going to go away going to
164.16 - go away in about a week which is still
166.20 - the front month and that's reflected up
168.04 - here is trading
169.84 - 7470 so remember the product that I'm
172.64 - going to be trading with 36 days to go
175.40 - is trading at
176.80 - $74 not 7472 a little Nuance about
181.28 - Futures and Futures options make sure
184.08 - you're trading the future that
186.12 - represents or you're looking at the
187.40 - future that represents the month that
189.44 - you're in you can notice as oil gets
191.80 - further uh out in time it's actually
194.52 - getting lower usually you would see
196.84 - something where the front month is lower
198.40 - and the back month has more cost to
200.20 - carry I don't think that's an anomaly
202.52 - for any type of future Direction but it
205.08 - is something to check out and notice
207.52 - when that's happening another thing you
208.60 - should notice about is skew let's get
210.40 - back to that so that the at the money is
211.92 - 74 that's why this line is right here at
214.48 - 74 and not up at 74.5 or closer to 75 if
219.28 - it was showing you that the future was
221.36 - trading
222.96 - 7472 showing you that the future is
225.00 - trading closer to 74 that's what that
227.48 - line is here in the middle that's the at
229.48 - the money strike so let's go $10 up just
232.84 - to take a quick look and you'll notice
234.80 - that that option is trading around $160
237.52 - on the offer now let's try to see if
239.56 - there call or putc you go down from 74
242.84 - down to 64 all I'm doing is going an
245.52 - equal distance away from the at the
247.44 - money all things being equal each strike
250.64 - has the same probability of success to
252.56 - it but look the 84 is trading for 82
257.60 - cents that means that the I'm sorry the
260.40 - 64 is trading for 82 cents that means
263.68 - the 84 call option has twice as much
267.68 - almost twice as much premium even though
270.12 - it's an equal distance away which means
272.00 - that Delta is going to be larger too you
274.88 - notice the Delta here is 24 on the call
277.92 - and the Delta here on the put uh is
280.68 - closer to 15 14 15 so as volatility
284.92 - expands options get more Delta to them
287.32 - that's why your Delta will change when
289.12 - you have a position on that's equal
291.12 - distance away like a strangle when
292.96 - volatility expands and contracts your
295.40 - Delta's Dynamic good way of looking at
297.52 - it what am I going to look to do here
299.44 - well I'm going to show you one more
300.84 - thing first I'm going to go to
304.08 - ovx
305.64 - semicolon
307.88 - CGI okay you'll notice that there's no
310.20 - options for this because this is just a
311.92 - crude oil um VIX Index what you could do
316.20 - is look at what that's been doing that's
317.96 - really just showing you what the
319.88 - volatility and now that I just showed
322.20 - you what skew is what the skew and
324.00 - volatility is doing in oil ovx is oil
326.96 - don't ask me the CBOE came it's the cbee
329.36 - product I don't know why they name it
330.48 - like this but that's how it is you'll
332.04 - notice it's about as high as it's been
334.16 - yeah it was higher day two or three but
336.20 - you'll notice if you're looking for a
337.68 - median or mean price you would say it
340.00 - would be around 34 or 35 so there's an
342.32 - awful lot of call skew here uh there's
345.84 - typically always call skew in oil but
348.76 - now that call skew is at an extreme I'm
351.12 - going to take advantage of that by going
353.16 - back to the well in for
355.44 - slcl I did a 1x two ratio spread a few
358.56 - days ago we were able ble to take it off
360.12 - for a $100 Pro uh product uh profit I'm
362.96 - going to go back to that well today take
365.44 - on a little bit more risk because when I
367.60 - placed the other trade on in oil uh
369.72 - about a week or so ago we had more time
371.64 - we able to go further away from at the
373.24 - money and I was able to go a little bit
374.92 - wider but I still like this trade
377.16 - because it has that high implied
379.24 - volatility and skew I'm going to go to
381.60 - around the well I said the 15ish Deltas
384.52 - where I normally like to go I'm going to
385.68 - go about to the 18 Delta that's taking a
387.52 - little bit more risk especially with the
389.12 - product being a little bit higher
390.52 - getting a little bit closer I'm going to
391.84 - buy one of the 88 uh calls I'm going to
395.60 - sell two two of the 94 calls now I
401.12 - personal preference typically like to
403.52 - trade the whole numbers um even though
406.96 - the the the stri the there it's three
409.20 - cents wide here it's three cents wide
412.08 - here it's 3 cents wide here two cents
415.56 - wide here two cents wide here if all the
418.16 - options have the same uh with to the bid
421.24 - ask then I'll trade any one of the
423.04 - strikes I'll trade the 88 and a halfs or
425.16 - or 88s or or or 93 and a half doesn't
428.40 - make a difference to me but when the
429.68 - options get a little bit wider the whole
432.44 - number options typically have tighter
434.56 - markets so as a little kind of thing I
436.80 - like to go into a little bit of a tip a
438.96 - little bit of a of a um tighter Market I
442.68 - got filled at 37 cents I believe let me
445.56 - take a look if that's 100% true go here
448.36 - to the follow page
450.72 - go to Bob the trader with my smiling
452.88 - face and I did get filled at 37 cents I
455.68 - gave you a little bit of a description
457.04 - here going back to the well see what I
458.92 - did there a 1 by two
461.76 - omnidirectional bearish ratio spread
464.92 - with massive call skew I just showed you
466.84 - that massive call skew but if you don't
468.52 - want to wait to see this podcast maybe
470.28 - get a little hint to where I'm going on
471.72 - what I did and that's always the price
473.56 - there you can click duplicate this trade
475.40 - right on the T trade platform it'll go
477.28 - right out there and populate it for you
479.20 - um but let's go back to that trade page
481.72 - if I can in CL just to take a quick look
484.28 - at some of the numbers 97% pop got to
487.84 - like that $30 a day in Theta Decay
491.24 - because um this is remember this is
493.28 - almost 10 times the size it is 10 times
496.32 - the size of a Uso so a 1 by two ratio
499.48 - spread here is really like a 10x $20 10x
502.88 - 20 ratio spread contract wise in Uso so
507.24 - this is not for everybody even though it
509.52 - only uses $3600 let's call it $3,700 in
513.04 - buying power your max profit could be
516.60 - $637 let's just round down to $6,000
519.88 - because you are long this 1 by two long
523.28 - 188 call short two 90 calls 94 calls and
528.32 - if not a great probability but if we got
531.52 - a pin in oil at 94 and you're still in
534.44 - this trade at expiration which you would
535.84 - not be able to because you're going to
537.12 - want to get out of this trade a week or
538.40 - so before uh expiration plus with span
541.96 - margining your buying power is going to
545.20 - increase the closer you get
547.96 - to uh expiration in time and closer you
552.16 - get to expiration in at the money so if
556.80 - the stock was trading at 94 this buying
559.00 - power can go up you know twofold at
561.28 - least I could check that out for you in
562.92 - just a quick second I did this the last
564.48 - time but let me digress for a moment
566.28 - it's $66,000 because if this product was
568.80 - at expiration
570.12 - at 94 just a sco under this 88 call
573.84 - would be worth $6 that
576.04 - $6,000 this $94 calls that your short
578.60 - the two of them would be worth nothing
580.52 - you sold it for
582.16 - $370 not 37 that's $370 that's like
586.64 - selling something in the equities at
590.04 - 3.70
592.20 - $370 um you can do this in an IRA
595.32 - account if you're so inclined to trade
597.64 - oil product there on the trade platform
600.32 - I don't think you can do it if you're
601.64 - using a different platform I don't know
603.52 - of any other platform that allows you to
604.80 - do it an IRA account to be short naked
607.40 - calls you could be short naked calls in
609.52 - an equity in tasty trade uh as long as
612.40 - you have the amount of buying power that
613.72 - the trade requires let me take a look uh
616.52 - what else a Delta here basically Delta
619.08 - zero I say this is omnidirectional uh
622.24 - bearish spread because you'll notice
623.72 - this green line gets to my break even my
626.88 - break even is a little over $100 here
629.48 - now oil hasn't been over $100 and hasn't
632.28 - moved that much in a in a in a 36 day uh
636.04 - period here this would be about the
637.12 - biggest move we had from 66 uh to just
640.68 - about 80 that's uh $14 there and we're
644.48 - outside of that
645.84 - $14 uh range here so I mean to me uh
649.96 - that's why the trade has a high
651.48 - probability success $97 but you know
654.28 - what nobody knows anything and nobody
656.96 - wants to sit there with with you know a
658.80 - couple of ,000 loss while you wait for
660.76 - this to be profitable unless you have
662.52 - the amount of buying power uh in your
664.36 - account here as the product goes higher
666.20 - you'll notice that the mid price gets uh
668.28 - gets bit up a little bit so maybe you
669.96 - can get filled uh another $10 better
672.96 - than I what's my PR profit Target on
675.16 - this I don't know uh 100 bucks 150 bucks
678.48 - 200 bucks 300 bucks something like that
681.28 - uh this should contract nicely uh if oil
685.20 - goes lower that's why I said
687.40 - omnidirectional bearish spread because
689.88 - there's no risk to the downside in oil
693.48 - oil can go to any price to the downside
695.64 - obviously you just have out of the money
697.60 - calls so that's going to keep you um
700.68 - profitable there let's take a look at
702.24 - what I just said a moment ago uh how
703.92 - your buying power can change on that $6
706.80 - spread I'll just go to an extreme here
708.80 - I'll buy one of the 60 calls I'll tell
711.52 - sell two of the 606 calls just to
714.64 - simulate that for you that $3,000 in
717.24 - buying power goes up to4 $1,000 so this
721.04 - is a big Traders product this is not for
725.64 - the faint of heart or for those in a
727.80 - smaller account at least not in my
729.64 - opinion I'll go to at the money buying
731.40 - the 70s and sell the 76s one by two I'm
735.12 - just simulating that same $2 uh WID
738.28 - spread and you'll notice that the buying
739.88 - power goes up to about
741.64 - $10,000 from the $3600 that we had
744.44 - before so remember your buying power is
747.40 - definitely going to change with span
748.68 - margining it's a phenomenon to Futures
751.56 - options it does not happen in equity
754.64 - options so if you're not familiar with
