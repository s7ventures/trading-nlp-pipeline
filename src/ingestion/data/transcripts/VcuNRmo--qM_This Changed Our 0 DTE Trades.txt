0.16 - anti-correlation and zero DT we did a
2.16 - piece on anti-correlation on Friday
3.80 - which was longer duration and I thought
5.72 - it was really interesting we got a ton
6.96 - of feedback so we're going to take it up
8.84 - another notch and go we're going to take
10.52 - anti-correlation to the zero DTE does
12.84 - anti-correlation really matter with
14.84 - respect to zero DTE trades does the vix
17.12 - matter when it when it relates to the
18.84 - snps with respect to zero DT trades
21.16 - let's take a look so the market and
22.60 - volatility are generally anti-correlated
24.32 - when one Rises the other Falls right the
26.24 - Market's falling a little bit today and
28.36 - the vix Futures are falling a little bit
30.24 - today so unchanged right now yes so
32.40 - right now we got a problem Houston we
34.56 - got a problem we're in that 20% range
36.92 - yes it's a muted move while the effect
39.12 - is strong it's not absolute in practice
41.12 - all four combinations for spy and vix
44.28 - rising and falling are possible every
46.12 - Market open is exciting time for the
47.80 - zero DT Traders as they try and
50.12 - determine the best position to take or
52.64 - adjust how have short premium zero DT
55.68 - positions fared based on overnight moves
58.52 - in the spy and the vix is that a
60.56 - question that's a question without a
62.40 - volatility component to it o without a
64.72 - volatility component to it slight winner
66.84 - with big outlier moves how have short
68.72 - premium zero DT positions fared based on
72.08 - overnight moves in the SPX and the vix
74.48 - let's take a look and then we're going
75.68 - to look at them if they're correlated or
77.40 - not 18 months worth of data we're doing
79.60 - zero DT strangles we can buy the wings
82.12 - it's you'll see it here you can just
83.72 - reduce the p&l by $10 if you if you're
85.92 - buying Wings all trades were closed to
87.84 - 25% of Max profit or held to the end of
90.36 - the day if you didn't have any profits
91.92 - we contrasted the overall Performance
93.76 - Based on directions of the preceding
96.16 - night's move in the spy and the vix and
98.76 - all trades were assumed to be exercise
100.24 - at Mid price so last night for example
102.92 - was pretty pretty flattish you know the
105.20 - S&P really move and the the spy and the
108.08 - vixs were pretty flat overnight so it
109.92 - would be hard to say but sometimes you
111.88 - do get most time you get decent sized
113.68 - moves overnight let's go to next slide
115.44 - first we looked at
117.20 - 378 occurrences over the last 18 months
120.64 - and we determined that 35 Delta
122.88 - strangles 25 Delta strangles and 15
125.72 - Delta strangles worked no matter what
127.96 - happened but daily pnls obviously the
130.48 - bigger ones worked better and the SAR is
132.76 - like what's your worst case they're all
134.24 - kind of in the same ballpark so the zero
136.12 - DTS have generally been working as a
138.04 - strategy if you take them off at 25% of
140.36 - Max profit right we're kind of more
141.84 - around that middle column that 25 Delta
143.92 - here we're going to look at the SPX down
146.12 - and the vix up because remember they're
147.76 - inversely correlated right so there's
149.64 - 100 and what that say 137 occurrences of
153.08 - SPX down vix up out of 380 that's how
156.24 - shows how kind of strong the market spin
158.44 - when the SPX is down and the vix is up
160.92 - which is fairly normal your win rate is
163.04 - across the board super high your daily
165.88 - p&l super good and your c bar actually
168.88 - better than just on all the other
170.24 - occurrences so why do you think that is
173.00 - why the numers so good for SPX down vix
176.04 - up because you're selling into vix
177.56 - strength into the into the into the one
179.96 - day I would imagine yeah I think so too
181.84 - I I think because usually they rally
183.92 - that's what I think this is the SPX up
186.20 - vix down there are 92 occurrences here
189.04 - and the reason that this is interesting
191.28 - first of all I'm surprised by there's
192.24 - only 92 occurrences and second one with
193.88 - this is is the win rates are a little
196.00 - bit lower not significantly lower the
197.56 - win rates are lower but what's
199.04 - interesting here is that the daily p&l
201.68 - on all of these is down is a negative
203.88 - number what they're basically saying is
205.64 - when the vix is up do the zero days when
207.84 - the vix is down don't touch them right
209.92 - when volatility is low when the SPX is
212.32 - up and the vix is down this AR this is
214.44 - my argument for the vix one day same
216.80 - exact thing this is the whole freaking
218.40 - argument because um when you're doing
220.72 - the vix one day it doesn't make any
222.68 - sense when volatility is low just
224.48 - doesn't work vix up SPX up surprising a
227.64 - lot of occurrences this vix up SPX up
229.80 - when the vix is up you make money what's
231.76 - so interesting about this study is that
233.76 - vix up you make money vix down overnight
236.04 - you lose money the SPX doesn't really
237.84 - matter down vix down this one there's
240.84 - only 19 occurrences and this is the one
243.28 - that threw me off this slide cu the SPX
245.64 - the SPX down vix down the win rate was
248.92 - 100% in all 18 occurrences and the
251.64 - average p&l was huge seems weird to me
253.92 - how much different it is so basically
255.76 - premium came in on a down move no cabar
258.00 - because there's no losers over the past
259.68 - 18 months selling zero DT premium was
261.48 - generally successful when the vix fell
263.20 - overnight and the xros overnight down
265.72 - moves in SPX accompanied Contracting vix
268.56 - very rarely about once a month trades on
271.24 - dates following those were extremely
272.48 - successful but the sample size is too
274.04 - small to draw conclusions the efficient
275.84 - market hypothesis tells us not to put
277.48 - too much weight into this recent chart
278.96 - action while making our trading
280.48 - decisions but for highly active zero GT
283.28 - option sellers looking for overnight
285.40 - Rising vix regardless of XX movements
288.44 - looks like a good place to start what's
290.80 - your takeaway from this selling to
292.92 - strength in volatility yes sell into
295.76 - volatility strength
