0.08 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.16 - the bat batist and I have a trade idea
3.80 - for you today February 18th
6.72 - 2025 but first as we always do let's
9.60 - take a look at what the Market's doing
11.44 - even snps up
14.60 - $9 uh pretty tight range today of around
17.64 - 30 handles top to bottom NASDAQ uh up 13
22.08 - pretty much unchanged like theps Russell
25.08 - up 10 they're the leader of the
26.40 - clubhouse and the Dow obviously the
28.68 - weakest being down $70 volatility in by
32.72 - 16 volatility really hasn't gone
35.72 - anywhere today or as you could see here
38.60 - over the last week as we've been kind of
41.28 - trending higher in the market overall uh
44.80 - today all right like I always do I like
46.92 - to go to my high option uh volume list I
50.44 - click on those little lines there I have
52.92 - high option volume I like to move away
55.64 - from earnings so I click it so that
57.76 - earnings are um are are not a factor
61.52 - here uh they're all taken away so all
63.96 - these stocks would be the ones I'm
65.20 - looking at but before I get to the trade
67.00 - of the day I want to show you something
68.40 - that I did which is kind of a flyer
70.96 - something I don't normally do uh but I
73.44 - did do an
74.80 - smci today um you'll notice smci up $5
79.16 - in change it was up around $6 in change
82.08 - just a moment ago but it has humongous
85.20 - call skew let's take a look at smci you
87.84 - can see here the stock has gone from 20
89.72 - and change to 50 and change its old
93.16 - highs which are you know over the last
95.04 - year or so has been around 120 that's
97.96 - going to come into play so keep that in
99.88 - mind as I speak to you uh now about this
103.36 - trade that I put on as a flyer this is
106.56 - not mechanical this is not what I
108.76 - normally want everybody to do but every
110.36 - once in a while you know you see
112.16 - opportunity and you try to make it uh
115.08 - you try to make it stick so I went to
116.76 - march with 31 days knowing that I'm
120.08 - going to hold this probably all the way
122.32 - through expiration and I do want the
125.48 - stock to go higher this is not the type
128.04 - of trade where I normally do where I
129.76 - want the stock to do the opposite on
131.76 - this ratio spread that I'm going to do
133.52 - here when I took a look at some of these
135.88 - options the way they've been trading
137.80 - look at how far out you can go all the
140.80 - way back up to the highs of where the
143.40 - stock was and there's still plenty of
145.76 - option premium in here now they're 5060
148.12 - Cent that doesn't get me crazy to sell a
150.60 - naked option and use all that buying
152.52 - power for the 50 60 cents my name is not
155.40 - Tom snof so I'm going to have to do
157.48 - something where I can make a little bit
159.56 - of money in here if my directional
161.96 - assumption is correct so I went out to
164.40 - around the 10 Delta option and I bought
166.92 - the 97 call one time and I went all the
170.68 - way out to the 115 calls that's $18 wide
176.68 - and sold two of them uh uh let's uh
181.28 - click this one more time
183.76 - here uh make this sorry make this one
186.68 - too there we go um I was able to do this
190.00 - right where it is right now for a s Cent
192.72 - credit it's a 89 cent credit the credit
195.84 - you receive is really um inconsequential
199.92 - at this point what you will rarely see
202.72 - in a $50 stock the last time this
205.00 - happened was in GMC what you'll really
208.00 - rarely see in a very Rel relatively low
210.68 - price stock is going out two and three
214.32 - times in price and still being able to
217.36 - get a small credit I'm
219.84 - $18 wide here $18 wide which means that
224.96 - um $1,800 is my Max profit here $1,800
229.52 - plus the credit I received my break even
232.24 - on this is all the way above its old
235.00 - high for this year my break even is all
237.76 - the way out at 132 or
240.68 - $33 so what I'm really looking to do on
243.32 - this trade usually when I'm doing a 1 by
245.04 - two ratio spread which I'm going to do
246.68 - in Tesla in just a moment I'm looking to
249.12 - collect the credit I'm receiving what
251.12 - I'm doing here is saying okay you know
253.08 - what I don't know what's going on in
255.00 - smci you want to take it to the upside
258.28 - I'm going to put a flyer on here I'm
260.20 - going to use $1,600 in buying power I'm
263.44 - going to have a 99% pop which you know
265.80 - what with call skew you got to take that
267.96 - into consideration here that that that
270.52 - that that number is not quite realistic
272.72 - I mean 99% is just too high I get paid a
276.52 - small amount of theta dek I'm not
278.60 - looking at that and this is a small
280.52 - amount of negative Delta but remember if
283.08 - the stock closes or goes around 115
286.16 - we're going to have this huge call
288.80 - spread that we're going to be long the
291.20 - 9715 we're long that one time and we
294.52 - have an extra 115 call that we're short
297.76 - but with the extra 1,800 bucks that we
300.48 - have here it brings our break even as I
303.08 - just told to you above the old high from
305.80 - a year ago this is a complete flyer
308.52 - meaning you have to have $1,600 lying on
311.12 - the sidelines that you know you will
313.04 - never use again in the next 31 days
316.36 - because you're going to probably keep
317.60 - this on for most of the expiration you
319.84 - want the stock to slowly go higher uh to
323.68 - your 97 98 99 number where you make
327.20 - yourself two three four 500 bucks on
329.92 - your $1,600 in buying power that's my
332.48 - flyer trade you certainly could go a lot
335.32 - closer and collect a lot more um credit
338.68 - have a lower probability of profit let's
341.04 - just go to the 80s just for argument
343.08 - sakes I'll buy one of the 80s and I'll
345.84 - go uh I don't know uh $20 wide go up to
350.08 - the 110 if we can you won't be able to
352.52 - so we have to go $100 does do
354.72 - that 1 by two and you'll notice that
357.92 - it's a small debit you'll have to move
359.32 - it down a little bit there there's your
362.12 - now you're still get a small debit it's
364.00 - just these out of the- money calls like
366.20 - here here I'm doing one $895 $15 wide
370.12 - it's going to have basically the same
371.84 - pop basically the same amount of of
374.04 - buying power using your break even is
376.52 - obviously going to be a little bit lower
378.08 - down at 110 I like my far out really
381.56 - wide taking a flyer hey come bite me uh
385.68 - smci come trade up to 100 105 110 120
389.80 - even and I'll still be able to make
391.48 - money that's my flyer trade for you in
393.88 - smci using March options with 31 days
397.24 - doing everything that is not mechanical
399.80 - taking a flyer don't do this type of
401.92 - trade unless you have $1,600 in buying
404.24 - power that you never want to use and you
406.60 - assume that upside risk my next trade is
409.44 - going to go back into Tesla Tesla was
411.72 - one of the last trades I did um on this
415.00 - podcast before I took a quick little uh
417.16 - break there uh last week uh Tesla
420.64 - implied volatility Ivy rank still
422.68 - relatively high at 36 it has come down a
425.88 - little bit from when we put on that
427.72 - bullish trade when the stock made its
429.80 - lows at around 330 that was a nice catch
433.52 - on price and it was a nice catch um on
436.56 - the movement back up I'm going to do the
438.52 - same trade but I'm going to stay a
439.92 - little bit more mechanical here I'm
441.56 - going to go out to April with the stock
444.36 - down today down a174 you're going to be
446.92 - able to do it a little bit better price
448.28 - than I just did it a moment ago I'm
450.60 - gonna go uh on in Tesla I'm going to be
454.24 - an omnidirectional slightly bullish I
456.60 - don't want to be tested on my short
459.28 - strike unlike the smci trade I just did
462.32 - I'm going to buy one of the 280 puts I'm
465.76 - going to sell two of the 270 puts and
469.08 - again you're not you know here here I'm
470.96 - able to go uh $10 wide I did mine at
476.40 - $233 it's already 245 I did mind when
480.24 - the stock was down around 60 cents the
483.32 - stock has gone down by about a dollar
485.72 - and you see this has moved about 10
488.28 - cents that makes sense because the delta
491.40 - in here is long six every dollar move
494.28 - this should move around six bucks or so
496.24 - that's if volatility stays the same hey
498.40 - speaking of volatility let's see what
500.36 - that volatility is doing in Tesla right
503.40 - now I'm going to go uh right here you'll
505.32 - see volatility is down about 2% it was
508.56 - down about a half a % when I put the
510.72 - trade on the ivy rank is still high at
513.84 - 36% you remember when we did this trade
516.60 - uh about a week or so ago um implied
519.20 - volatility was expanding so even over
521.84 - the last 5 days volatility is staying
523.72 - bid even though it is down 2% this is
526.16 - really a directional trade on a stock
528.76 - that has not um participated in the
531.36 - movement that we've been seeing as of
533.64 - late in the market plus Tom wrote a uh
536.72 - Cherry Bomb today that was not favorable
539.48 - to Elon Musk and Tesla so we'll take the
541.92 - contrarian role and put on an
544.40 - omnidirectional slightly bullish trade
547.56 - in Tesla buying one of the 80 puts
550.40 - selling two of the 270 puts this is a
553.64 - capital intensive trade using almost
555.60 - $6,000
557.48 - 5,800 bucks it does have a 90% pop very
561.32 - similar to the smci uh trade what am I
564.32 - looking to do here I'm looking for the
566.08 - stock to go higher and probably making
568.32 - my dollar hopefully the stock goes
570.32 - higher tomorrow and goes higher in a big
573.00 - way or goes higher today in a big way
575.76 - unlike the smci trade where I want the
578.68 - stock to slowly go higher the stock goes
581.44 - higher faster that will make my trade a
583.88 - little bit less advantageous and harder
586.56 - for us to make money all I want the
588.56 - stock to do is stay above my break even
591.60 - on here which is down around
595.68 - $260 actually
597.80 - $245 below
600.04 - $260 that's why I have that high
602.12 - probability profit of 90%
604.80 - omnidirectional slightly bullish trade
607.12 - again if you're watching this podcast at
609.16 - the end of the day or later on you can
612.60 - always go to the follow page during the
614.96 - day I post these trades in real time

625.96 - podcast this is one if you make it you
628.12 - must trade at small I did half my normal
630.96 - size this is a flyer taking a shot smci
634.68 - trading like it's a takeover crazy
636.92 - upside call skew looking to hit uh a
639.92 - tweener here I want it could to go right
642.12 - there at 115 and stop uh come on plus
645.64 - 100 on the stock price but go slowly and
648.80 - in Tesla we got another trade it's a
650.80 - typical 1 by two omnidirectional
653.32 - slightly bullish trade more of what
