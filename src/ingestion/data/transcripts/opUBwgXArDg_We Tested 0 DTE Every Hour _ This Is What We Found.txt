0.04 - Market measures part three zero DT
2.00 - timing 24 marked our first full year of
4.20 - gathering the zero DT data tasty Market
7.04 - measures are chance to share the results
9.00 - with you in depth as we head into 2025
11.44 - we're going to review some of our best
13.24 - zert research of 24 and we're going to
16.08 - explore the importance of timing when it
18.44 - comes to zero DT trades so our study
21.56 - using one year of data and zero DT SPX
23.80 - options collected every 10 minutes for
25.28 - 15 years worth of data um in the 45 day
28.64 - options so in the zero it's whatever it
31.08 - is 20 months and in the other data we're
33.44 - going to show you is 15 years We
35.28 - examined selling strangles with 20 Delta
37.20 - legs both at the zero DT Market open and
40.88 - 45 days expiration we contracted the
42.80 - hourly performance as a percent of the
45.04 - initial credit for the Zer DTS and the
46.72 - weekly performance of the 45 dat
48.48 - expiration trades next slide please lot
52.96 - of stuff here this is old stuff that
54.56 - we're just showing you this is weeks
56.68 - verse hours okay the first one 4 5 days
60.36 - to expiration strangles first two weeks
63.32 - average p&l change 11% second two weeks
66.24 - 24% thirdd week tough one um minus two
70.52 - and then the final week plus 16 standard
73.28 - deviation of change you could see the
75.84 - the first week the key is the last line
78.60 - the standard deviation of change 6% is
81.20 - very manageable 12% very manageable 28
84.84 - and 53 that's where it gets tough it's
87.00 - not so much it's not worth the return at
88.68 - that point let's go to the next slide
92.00 - and this one we're going to show you
93.12 - zero DTS so on the Zero DTS strangles
95.76 - it's the same thing look at the last
97.40 - line standard deviation of panl change
100.84 - what's interesting here is that the
102.76 - first two hours 19% manageable second
105.96 - two hours 34% the third two hours 56%
109.20 - and then the final hour
111.40 - 153 yeah you're just swinging you're
113.40 - just swinging it 153 now I'm not saying
116.84 - minus five in your average p on first
118.84 - two hours nothing great okay but um the
122.16 - second 2 hours you know that's pretty
123.64 - damn good so in that first 2-hour period
126.40 - there's a chance to make some money it
129.44 - it's not worth the risk holding to the
131.08 - end of the day at 19 and 34% very
134.88 - manageable 56 to 153 not so much both
138.96 - the Zer GT and the 45 de St exporation
141.56 - trades had more stable prices early in
143.48 - their LIF spans as measured by the lower
145.76 - standard deviation of returns that's
147.08 - what I showed you for both managing
148.64 - winners to capture early success were
150.88 - the more beneficial Mechanics for early
153.28 - in the zero DTS it just means the first
155.12 - few hours instead of the first few weeks
157.00 - for the 45 days for handling losers the
160.24 - zero DTS gave more opportunities for
162.56 - Traders to succeed using their own style
165.24 - more risk Toler and Traders could choose
166.80 - to stay in losers and hope for Recovery
168.84 - before the close did this late in the
171.48 - day success mean it was a good idea to
173.04 - trade zero DTS even if you missed the
174.92 - Market opening next slide let's have
177.56 - some fun this is our kind of fun so
181.00 - using 20 months worth of data in the SPX
183.36 - Zer DTS now people that have a smaller
185.96 - account that want to trade without
187.88 - pattern day trading rules using the es
189.52 - options same exact thing it's not cash
192.64 - settled but it's the same underlying
194.84 - product es
197.32 - spy um SPX they're all the same
201.56 - Mees XSP they're all the same but some
205.04 - have pattern day trading rules some
206.28 - Don't We examined selling Zer DT
209.36 - strangle using the 20 and 30 Delta
211.04 - strikes at Market open 10: a.m. noon and
213.36 - 1:30 all the all the times are Chicago
217.00 - Times
219.20 - CT all the trades were managed if they
221.36 - reached 25% losers that didn't reach 25%
224.00 - were allowed to expire all trades were
226.16 - assumed at Mid price let's go to next
229.72 - slide okay so you can take a little off
231.72 - if you want here's your 20 Delta
233.84 - strangles that were um these were just
238.48 - the on the Zero days
240.68 - plac at Market open you made you 89% win
245.36 - rate placed at 10: a.m. 88 so so it
248.76 - didn't matter what time you placed for
249.84 - the win rate what it mattered for was
251.60 - how much money you made and the average
253.40 - pnl is significantly higher if you put
256.20 - your trades in um early in the day
259.40 - period that's it first two hours 30
262.08 - Deltas triangles exact same thing
264.92 - everything happens in the first
267.32 - everything happens p&l wise in the first
270.44 - two hours or the majority of it so since
272.68 - we started trading the Zer TTS in 23
275.72 - they have been consistently profitable
278.08 - for short premium traders who took
279.40 - profits early choosing strikes by Delta
281.64 - automatically adjust trades for the
283.12 - current volatility levels in the time
284.56 - remaining in the contract giving
286.28 - consistent success probabilities and
288.64 - helping retail Traders expand into new
291.96 - Arenas with confidence while the zero TT
294.84 - trades had more success stories for
296.56 - those who held on through expiration
298.80 - than the 4 5day trades placing new
301.60 - trades late in the day was detrimental
304.52 - just like placing new trades late in a
306.40 - cycle can also be a little bit
308.44 - detrimental
