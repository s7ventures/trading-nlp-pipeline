0.20 - so last week was a pretty sizable move
2.84 - lower but volatility didn't really move
4.84 - until Friday even based on where it
6.64 - closed Friday it doesn't seem that high
8.56 - does that make you think that maybe this
10.36 - sell-off will be shortlived yeah I mean
12.56 - I think we're going to have cyclical
14.48 - sideways action with a slight bullish
17.48 - bias to it going into the end of the
18.92 - year that's just my opinion Victor Jones
20.96 - thinks we're crashing and burning you
22.76 - know I mean opinions are like armpits
24.80 - you usually have two they usually both
26.16 - stink and trade what's in front of you
27.48 - but that's what I'm looking at do I
28.60 - think it'll be shortlived actually don't
30.56 - I know Tony does that's what makes a
32.40 - market exactly there are definitely
34.32 - different schools on this the biggest
35.88 - volatility risk in my opinion always
37.64 - comes from lower volatility levels not
39.32 - higher so I think there's more risk now
41.00 - that if volatility was higher
