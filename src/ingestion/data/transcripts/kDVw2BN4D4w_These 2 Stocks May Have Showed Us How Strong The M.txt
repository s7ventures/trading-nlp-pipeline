0.04 - so a couple weeks back we talked about
1.72 - one way to analyze the potential impact
3.60 - of a single stock on a broader index so
5.84 - if a stock is expected to move 5% and
8.56 - it's makes up like some you know it's
10.36 - one of the components of the index how
11.80 - much can we expect the index to move
13.16 - there's a way to calculate that so today
15.12 - I did my very very best to back test
17.60 - this um and it's very hard to do for
19.64 - reasons that I will get into but I
21.44 - really wanted to look at some
22.48 - significant moves and some major names
24.12 - over the last year approximately and
25.92 - understand how the realized moves in the
27.08 - S&P kind of compared to that so those
29.04 - expected estimates sounds yeah okay
31.48 - let's try to get through this quickly
33.00 - this a recap um I I'm probably not going
35.76 - to spend a lot of time on this if you
37.12 - want to go check out that segment it was
38.36 - from two weeks ago but basically the
40.28 - expected move of a stock or I'm sorry
43.20 - the expected impact on a stock can be
45.96 - estimated if you have an expected um
49.64 - return for one stock and the correlation
51.72 - between the two of them so for example
53.36 - like let's say that two stocks A and B
55.08 - are correlated with a correlation of 08
57.20 - and expected a is you know going to
60.00 - stock a is expected to move 5% around
62.64 - earnings so the expected impact I guess
65.04 - on Stock B is just the correlation
66.72 - between them times that expected move so
68.48 - 4% make sense okay yep okay next
71.56 - slide okay so um that previous case is
75.04 - if we assume the volatilities are
76.28 - similar we can also sort of like beta
78.32 - weight this a little bit by taking the
79.68 - volatility of right the standard
81.24 - deviation of returns of stock whatever
83.52 - you're interested in dividing it by the
85.28 - expected um the standard deviation of
87.56 - returns of whatever you have the
88.84 - expected move for makes sense you've
90.08 - been doing this for years beta weighted
91.20 - notional um IV very similar very similar
94.12 - but this is for expected move if you
95.24 - want to consider the expected stock on
97.36 - another stock right yeah I understand
99.20 - okay let's go to the next slide so if
100.56 - you wanted to extend this logic to an
102.60 - index right you take that formula yeah
105.96 - multiply by the weight of that holding
108.04 - in the index and then you just sum all
109.72 - them up okay right you're just taking a
111.60 - weighted sum of all those expected moves
113.64 - basically make sense so like if I wanted
116.04 - to calculate like apple is you know
117.84 - going to move 5% we're expecting it to
119.52 - move 5 5% when it reports earnings what
121.56 - is the expected move in the index right
123.76 - I can take all the Holdings of the index
125.32 - I can take the correlation between all
126.88 - those you know Holdings and apple and I
128.88 - can use this formula to calculate how
130.48 - much should the S&P move from that move
132.80 - expected make sense yes easy peasy okay
135.48 - let's go to the next slide then so what
136.92 - I wanted to do was actually try to look
138.44 - at some data to see how well this holds
140.44 - up um so it's very difficult to do this
144.04 - type of back test for like two reasons
145.84 - number one um there's not a lot of very
148.12 - big moves that you can really look at
150.28 - over you know some time frame um here I
152.60 - wanted to look at the top Holdings of
153.88 - the S&P so that's Apple Microsoft Nvidia
155.88 - Amazon meta or Google they all kind of
157.56 - move around in the top like six spots
159.64 - basically um over the last couple of
161.56 - years and so I wanted to say okay on the
163.76 - days when these you know assets had
165.96 - moves that were larger than 5% either to
168.16 - the upside or to the downside what was
169.92 - the expected in you know index impact
172.76 - there's not a lot of moves like that
174.08 - that happened um in this period of time
176.48 - and then in addition to that you also
177.64 - need the historical weights of the S&P
179.84 - over your back test period and those
181.12 - aren't really easy to get so not a lot
183.32 - of data here but I wanted to see if
184.72 - there was maybe something interesting
185.88 - that could come about and so here we
187.88 - looked at from 2024 to 2025 we want to
190.36 - see like apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon
192.80 - meta and Google like when they have a
194.44 - move greater than 5% or less than 5% how
197.52 - did the SNP what was the expected move
199.84 - in the S&P and then how did it actually
201.60 - move what were those results make sense
204.00 - using that formula that I showed on the
205.40 - previous slide sure okay let's go to the
207.44 - next slide so um on unsurprisingly when
210.76 - a major holding in the S&P um has a
213.24 - large move to the upside or to the
214.68 - downside the index is unsurprisingly
217.12 - expected to follow suit in fact um for
219.56 - moves that are this large remember we're
221.24 - looking at plus minus 5% um the index in
224.72 - this very limited data set was expected
226.76 - to have the same sign of daily return so
229.56 - move to the upside or to the downside um
232.68 - at the same time 100% of the time right
235.72 - so like if any of those Holdings move
237.84 - like 5% to the upside we would expect
240.24 - that the S&P should be positive that day
242.88 - based on this expected return that we
245.48 - looked at in the previous slide does
247.04 - that kind of make sense yeah totally
248.84 - which totally makes sense as you would
250.00 - expect right
251.04 - Tony yeah sure makes sense I I'll give
253.64 - you a size up answer yeah it makes sense
256.00 - um it's a um we're again we're looking
258.88 - at very large moves so like here we're
260.64 - looking at like mea was up 20% we would
263.36 - expect the S&P to move up some
264.96 - percentage and generally we'd expect
266.36 - that to be positive if meta is moving to
268.04 - the upside 20% that's itively what we're
270.36 - saying here in this back test when we
272.16 - looked at the expected moves for these
274.00 - very large moves in the Holdings of the
275.44 - S&P um we would expect that the S&P
277.72 - would have at the very least the same
279.16 - sign as this company that was moving
281.44 - very much to the upside or to the
282.84 - downside in this back test does that
284.80 - kind of make sense yeah let's go to the
286.36 - next slide so when we looked at the
288.88 - actual moves we did see that like the
291.12 - direction kind of aligned like aligned
293.60 - with the expected move but the actual
295.56 - numerical values differed by quite a bit
297.92 - um so here we have all of those those
300.08 - you know those I think it was like 36
301.88 - data points all of those big moves in
303.88 - those six Holdings over the last year
306.32 - and that the kind of hatched bar shows
309.40 - the expected move and then the kind of
311.12 - solid bar shows the realized move and
313.00 - then it's green for positive and it's
314.36 - red for negative what we can see is that
316.24 - when we expect a positive move in the
318.48 - S&P S&P is usually positive when we
321.36 - expect a negative move in the S&P the
323.76 - S&P is usually negative um but the
325.76 - actual size of that move can vary from
328.24 - its expected value quite a bit bit and
330.64 - that's usually because there are a ton
332.36 - of other factors that are actually
333.52 - moving the markets we're looking at very
335.40 - extreme moves so these are kind of edge
336.96 - cases oh what are you trying to prove
339.16 - trying to prove anything um but I did
341.72 - notice something a little bit weird that
344.20 - inspired this back test that I'll talk
345.84 - about in a second and I kind of wanted
347.16 - to talk about it that make sense okay
350.08 - I'm just trying to figure out what
351.00 - you're trying to what what you're going
352.96 - for here let's go to the next slide so I
356.92 - wanted to look at a couple interesting
358.40 - examples Maybe um and I don't know if
360.68 - we're going to have time to do it but um
363.76 - so in February 2nd meta jumped over 20%
366.48 - after earnings the expected move in the
367.92 - S&P was about 3% but it only moved
370.52 - 1% okay let's go to the next
374.04 - slide so on August 5th Nvidia dropped
377.08 - over 6% and the expected move in the S&P
379.20 - was 75% however the S&P dropped almost
381.76 - 3% because that was also coupled with
383.80 - concerns around the Nicki crashing right
386.32 - over 12% okay so we can see there's a
388.64 - lot of instances when these kind of like
390.16 - external factors sort of like move the
391.84 - markets in ways that sort of deviate
393.96 - from these expected moves but what we do
396.36 - actually see if we go to the next
398.40 - slide is that 89% of the time the signs
402.08 - of the expected moves and the realized
403.68 - moves were the same right so even though
406.40 - like you know Nvidia dipped um I'm
409.16 - trying to think how to describe this so
410.88 - even though like you know Facebook's
413.12 - earnings or meta's earnings might have
414.96 - caused this very large move the actual
416.76 - move in the S&P might not line up with
418.64 - that expected value but the signs
420.68 - usually do that happened about 89% of
422.92 - the time so we found that it was
424.72 - actually pretty weird generally speaking
427.72 - for the move in the index not to match
430.32 - the sign of one of these major Holdings
432.88 - sort of when they have a big move does
434.40 - that make
436.04 - sense yeah so the overall the expected
438.80 - moves and the realized moves were this
440.40 - yeah sure that kind of makes sense right
442.16 - yeah but interestingly so and that's
444.24 - kind of what inspired this a little bit
445.52 - if we go to the next slide we had two
448.68 - deviations from that like recently
451.12 - actually um two pretty significant
453.56 - deviations um and we'll talk about that
455.56 - more in the next
457.56 - slide there we go so on January 30th
460.68 - Microsoft dropped 6% after earnings um
463.88 - and there were other concerns that kind
465.64 - of like you know were also bubbling up
467.76 - around that time as well on February 5th
469.76 - Google dropped over 7% also around
472.00 - earnings and the expected drop in the
473.32 - index was 1.7% so in both of those cases
476.36 - we expected some pretty big drops in the
478.08 - S&P but they actually turned out green
480.28 - you remember those days it happened
481.60 - pretty recently yeah yeah I mean I don't
484.72 - remember like there's a lot of days when
487.24 - when Google or Microsoft or Nvidia had
489.80 - big even mostly Apple have had huge
492.04 - moves and and the index has done not
494.64 - what we expected but I I think I
497.20 - remember both those days that's weird
499.40 - that doesn't happen a lot when we're
501.04 - talking about moves that are greater
502.48 - than 5% it's actually weird for one of
504.60 - the top Holdings in the S&P that does
506.80 - not happen very much that happens like
509.08 - like
510.44 - in in this data set it's happened
512.12 - recently more so I feel like because
514.76 - like like just in apple alone and then
518.40 - and then Tesla had you know dropped 30%
521.80 - as the market was going higher for the
523.80 - last two weeks so it's kind of weird
525.32 - there been a few weird moves like that
526.96 - it's weird and it's been kind of recent
528.56 - and two data points is not enough to
530.32 - like indicate a trend and there's been
532.00 - other data points as well we were just
533.48 - looking at like six companies basically
535.76 - um but I kind of wanted to look at this
538.20 - because I think it's worth watching over
539.64 - the next couple of months CU it has felt
541.56 - weird and I wanted to look at see if any
543.88 - data kind of supported that and it turns
545.76 - out like two very big moves two very big
548.40 - drops in Microsoft and Google like we
550.68 - would have 100% expected the market to
552.64 - end red those days and it turned out
554.08 - green yeah and I'm wondering if that
556.16 - kind of might indicate that there's some
557.76 - shift in market dynamics right now or
559.52 - some maybe shift away from Tech or some
561.40 - shift away from AI or something that
563.72 - could be resulting in maybe more
565.36 - optimism um that was kind of reflected
567.44 - in the index uh after these two very big
569.92 - drops happened those were weird um and I
572.60 - kind of wanted to try to do a study that
574.28 - showed a little bit of context to show
576.20 - exactly why because it's not out of the
577.72 - realm of possibility for Apple to drop
579.48 - 3% or for you know Tesla to drop 4% and
582.44 - the index to wind up green but when
585.08 - Microsoft drops 6% and Google drops 7%
590.24 - and we're expecting the S&P to drop
593.12 - almost two and almost 2% in both of
595.36 - those cases and then it turns out green
596.96 - that's weird um it's not weird but it
599.40 - deviates from sort of the expected
601.00 - behavior that we can measure at least
602.48 - looking at the last year's worth of data
604.28 - that's what I was kind of trying to look
606.72 - at I get it I mean it just mean it just
609.32 - means it's broad-based the market is
611.76 - kind of I'm not sure that I can draw any
614.92 - takeaways from this that I can actually
616.44 - use yeah I that's yeah that's why I kind
621.32 - of I wanted to try the back test and the
623.04 - back test was difficult um for the
624.64 - reasons that I described but it was
626.36 - really those two data points that I
627.60 - found really interesting and I that's
628.92 - why I found found it was interesting cuz
630.88 - like I've been feeling this in my
632.20 - portfolio personally where we'll have
633.76 - these really big moves but then the
635.12 - indexes won't move very much and it felt
637.56 - like that's been happening more recently
639.48 - but it was really hard to actually
640.80 - measure that and this was kind of my
642.08 - attempt at sort that's fair I mean there
643.60 - have definitely been some individual
645.56 - stock moves you know today's another
647.96 - example but um
650.80 - and may I could I don't know if some of
653.08 - it has to do around earnings time or not
654.72 - but yeah I I understand where you're
656.32 - coming from I just don't know how to I
658.36 - don't know what how to take something
659.60 - away from this I could actually use yeah
661.56 - it's difficult to say because again it's
663.00 - not a lot of data that we're working
664.64 - with like if the indexes are maybe more
667.00 - resilient now than they have been um to
670.00 - some of these moves or a little bit more
671.44 - insulated from some of these moves it's
673.20 - a little it's you can't really claim
674.60 - that from a couple of data points but
676.88 - it's a trend that I want to keep
678.04 - watching um as we sort of continue to
680.36 - have like more you know volatility in
682.28 - 2025 so it's kind of that was the point
685.96 - beautiful lovely sick let's go to the
688.36 - takeaway slide we'll finish up so the
690.76 - potential impact of a single stock on an
692.64 - index can be estimated using historical
694.72 - price data and a detailed list of index
696.44 - components and component weights and
697.88 - based on this very limited back test the
699.40 - data roughly supports that when major
701.32 - holding is expected to undergo a large
703.24 - move we can expect the direction of the
705.68 - index move to match um and large moves
709.04 - resulting from earnings might move the
710.68 - index less than expected compared to you
712.76 - know moves resulting from Market or
714.16 - sector-wide events but we kind of need
715.64 - to do more research to be able to
716.88 - validate that and as well the recent if
719.00 - there is a trend it's not really
720.72 - measurable yet because there haven't
721.92 - been there hasn't been enough data but I
723.48 - think it's worth watching going into
725.48 - 2025 um because it's it's felt a bit
727.96 - weird trading and it was kind of hard to
730.20 - actually put numbers behind that before
732.08 - this kind of test sort of came out I
734.64 - don't know if there's a trend and I
735.88 - don't know if it's a bad thing either I
737.52 - don't know either yeah
