0.12 - so last week we talked about how the
1.76 - market might transition between
3.12 - different regimes or states with their
4.44 - own unique statistical properties that
6.04 - tend to propagate for a sustained period
8.12 - of time um and identifying these regimes
10.64 - is a very important part of active
12.00 - trading would you agree with that I
13.48 - would doing the best that you can at
14.88 - least I think understanding that there
18.04 - are different regimes is interesting I
20.40 - don't I don't think you can actually
22.48 - understand them would you say that if
24.76 - you if there are certain indicators that
27.00 - suggest we might have transitioned
28.44 - regimes then it's important to maybe
31.12 - I would love somebody like you to be
33.12 - actually able to tell me that with with
35.76 - some form of certainty I mean all of it
37.72 - is just you know it's hearsay it's it
41.40 - hearsay that's a loaded that's kind of
43.24 - loaded I don't know it's it's that is a
47.80 - very traditional industry answer that
50.84 - tasty would not accept oh that's a nice
53.36 - way of saying that huh that makes it's
54.88 - not an acceptable answer at Tasty to say
56.76 - that we've entered into a new regime you
59.36 - can say
60.96 - that it looks like you can say for
64.56 - example it looks like the market has
66.56 - rolled over or you can say it looks like
69.16 - we like when you get a like a vix pop
71.76 - right you would adjust your portfolio
74.12 - adjust maybe some of your positions
75.96 - strategy here here's a yesterday is a
77.52 - perfect example you could have said
78.76 - after two down days you could have said
80.80 - hey it looks like we're entering a new
83.36 - regime and then today they're up then
85.32 - you'd be like oh no we're not you know
86.96 - my point is you really you actually
88.48 - never know with markets sure that's
90.52 - valid okay um what I want to talk about
92.96 - today sort of introduce this concept of
94.64 - regimes specifically when the market
96.28 - transitions to a high volatil volatility
98.76 - regimes I think it has very unique
100.52 - characteristics that a lot of us might
102.72 - recognize um as the market transitioning
105.28 - into a higher volatility regime when I
107.24 - think of like volatility regimes I think
109.00 - they're kind of ranked by like
110.52 - volatility you got like the low
112.04 - volatility Market Market I'll accept
114.40 - that counselor okay I'll that's that's
116.44 - progress Tony did you hear that yeah
118.44 - yeah yeah he's been very very um
120.64 - agreeable today so far I'll accept that
122.32 - only because I think it takes longer to
123.96 - move out of a volatility regime than it
126.04 - does like a stock that's all sure okay
129.24 - when I'm talking about Market regimes
130.76 - they're usually classified by volatility
133.28 - so that's maybe maybe a little more
135.72 - little more your bread and but butter um
138.00 - so I wanted to talk about um sort of
139.96 - recognizing them in some of those
141.12 - telltale signs uh and let's go to the
143.12 - next slide so like I said U Market
145.28 - regimes are usually classified by unique
147.08 - volatility price and macroeconomic
148.64 - conditions and transitions between
150.12 - regimes are typically initiated sort of
151.80 - by broader shocks to the market and so
154.16 - for example we might move into a bull
156.32 - market for example after an interest
157.64 - rate cut or some kind of announcement of
160.20 - fiscal stimulus for example a bare
162.36 - Market might come from interest rate
163.68 - hikes or geopolitical crises or
165.40 - something else um and then you have like
167.00 - crashes right so like very high
168.88 - volatility conditions that are caused by
171.12 - very specific circumstances so you got
172.72 - like the Great Depression Black Monday
174.68 - 2008 housing crisis the co crash um so
177.24 - again very specific circumstances that
179.24 - cause something as volatile as a crash
181.04 - but either way there are these sort of
182.28 - like triggers almost that might move us
184.40 - into a different sort of regime might
186.64 - not but yeah okay so let's go we're
189.04 - we're we're going along so far let's go
190.68 - to the next slide and so while Market
192.84 - regimes tend to exist for a sustained
194.64 - period of time their duration and
196.36 - stability tends to tends to vary um
199.08 - because they're right driven by pretty
200.52 - unique circumstances right we can agree
202.28 - about with that yeah but generally
205.44 - especially when we you know do
206.56 - quantitative back tests we sort of
208.44 - assume that there's somewhere between
209.88 - two and four market regimes with the
211.32 - exact number that you use it kind of
212.72 - depends on exactly how you're trying to
215.40 - test a strategy um and that's because so
218.08 - for example if you assume there's only
219.56 - two Market regimes you might lose some
222.00 - information about the granularity about
224.56 - these different regimes but that being
226.56 - said you reduce the risk of overfitting
228.60 - so like basically the risk of developing
230.60 - a strategy that works really really well
232.32 - for your historical data but doesn't
234.24 - work well in a generalized way for the
236.08 - future if you assume there's more Market
237.96 - regimes you might have more granularity
239.96 - but you run a higher risk of overfitting
241.68 - for example like developing strategies
243.68 - that might work really well for this
245.00 - historical data set but don't
246.28 - necessarily work well in general so the
248.16 - exact number that you would use really
249.40 - depends on what how you're trying to run
250.92 - your run your back test your analysis
254.48 - yeah I'm okay with that okay we're okay
257.44 - so far yeah going better than that's not
260.24 - bad yep hell yeah okay so let's go to
263.04 - the next slide so common indicators of a
265.64 - regime shift so like you've talked about
267.72 - identifying regimes volatility regimes
270.08 - in the market it's pretty difficult to
271.60 - do um but there's some telltale signs
273.76 - specifically when the market moves into
275.16 - a high volatility regime such as a
277.00 - selloff and for example when we like you
281.12 - know try to identify this regime shift a
283.00 - lot of the times they're characterized
284.64 - by very large moves in the market to
286.60 - nobody's surprise if we look at 3.7
289.84 - daily like daily moves in um in the S&P
292.48 - either to the upside or to the downside
293.80 - we can see how they kind of cluster
295.00 - together so this is again this
296.40 - volatility clustering of these three
297.84 - sigma moves which again we have these
300.16 - big daily moves might be indicative that
301.96 - we've moved into a high volatility
303.64 - Market regime right one of these sort of
306.92 - indicators yeah MH 100% 100% as well as
311.32 - marked by let's go to the next slide
313.00 - increased intraday volatility which when
316.28 - we look at intraday volatility um we can
318.36 - see that they Spike around the popping
319.92 - of the Doom bubble 2008 uh we see a
322.40 - little blip around 2016 2020 and then we
324.76 - got the bare Market of 22 um which again
327.24 - can be kind of used as an indicator that
328.84 - we sort of trans positioned into one of
330.60 - these high volatility regimes don't see
332.48 - that every day okay let's go to the next
334.48 - slide and then as well our favorite
336.40 - indicator uh the vix um the vix is uh
339.76 - very very very rarely above 30 it does
342.00 - not happen an awful lot but when it does
343.52 - happen it's typically when we've moved
344.88 - again into one of these high volatility
346.92 - uh Market States um we did see it even
349.12 - earlier this year where we kind of
350.48 - popped above 30 but that wasn't
352.20 - necessarily sustained so it's not
353.80 - necessarily like a fullprof indicator
356.20 - but generally when we've seen the vix
358.64 - above third above 30 between 30 and 40
361.52 - happens about 7% of the time or above 40
363.40 - about 3% of the time that tends to
365.08 - happen when we're in these like Ultra
366.84 - volatile Market environments that again
368.60 - tend to propagate for a sustained period
370.56 - of time although the duration of that
372.48 - tends to vary because again they're
373.80 - triggered by very unique circumstances
376.40 - right absolutely 100% amazing let's go
379.68 - to the next slide and then we got
381.72 - another GIF guess what time it is it's
383.32 - GIF
384.76 - o'clock and then another pretty common
387.32 - indicator when we've shifted into this
388.96 - High volatility Market state is when you
391.20 - kind of see correlations to the market
393.32 - increase across broad sectors so here we
395.92 - got spy xlk XLV xly xop a bunch of these
399.12 - sector ETFs and what we look at these
401.44 - 30-day correlations when we had the co
404.16 - sell off in 2020 we can see that
406.04 - everything even utilities got a lot more
408.32 - correlated to the market which is why
410.12 - underlying diversification is so
411.96 - important even though these are rare
413.36 - circumstances when everything moves in
415.40 - correlation with the market and this is
416.80 - price correlation too we have to worry
418.44 - about volatility correlation as well
420.52 - like you want to be as Diversified as
422.36 - possible to sort of protect the
424.12 - portfolio from this sort of event
426.72 - happening yeah that's good pretty
428.64 - picture so this is another another
430.32 - indicator yep so let's go to the next
432.32 - slide um so predicting transitions
435.44 - between different regimes or the
437.52 - characteristics of specific regimes it's
439.88 - in real time it's a pretty interesting
441.48 - area of research but I don't think can
443.24 - be really used dependably by retail
445.88 - Traders generally speaking they could be
447.80 - used dependably by anybody I'm kind of
449.80 - inclined to agree um yeah I'm kind of
451.84 - inclined to agree but that being said uh
454.16 - and this is where I might lose you guys
455.24 - a little bit but uh let's go to the next
457.12 - slide but there are actually pretty
459.40 - reliable computational methods for
461.36 - detecting when a regime shift has
463.48 - already happened in real time and we've
466.44 - talked about some of the intuitive
468.00 - indicators like price correlation
469.60 - increasing intraday volatility
471.08 - increasing the vix increasing there's
473.08 - certain indicators that we can use but
474.40 - there's also computational methods that
476.36 - would typically used be used for other
477.80 - problems in engineering that we can use
479.52 - used to detect regime shifts in real
481.88 - time specifically when we classify
484.00 - volatility or when we classify Market
485.68 - regimes by volatility we don't I I'll go
488.16 - through all the other words on that
489.32 - slide but what do we think about that I
491.12 - think
492.92 - it's I mean I think you're genius I
495.68 - think it's okay I I I still don't know
498.08 - if it's if I I I still don't know
500.92 - how I still don't know that you can
504.36 - truly detect it but I think that you
506.40 - think that there's I think you can
508.28 - detect it but that doesn't necessarily
510.24 - mean that you can trade it if that makes
512.04 - sense like I might know that I'm in a
513.52 - high in hindsight in hindsight you can
516.32 - say it but I don't know that you can
518.96 - detect it happening that's well maybe
522.68 - that'll be next week's segment how about
524.24 - that boom that's what I'm talking about
526.40 - good job out of you oh yeah look love
528.92 - getting back into
