0.08 - is there any evidence that a volatile
2.64 - January leads to a volatile year I don't
5.76 - think so but I mean if you have a any
8.64 - volatile month is going to kind of skew
11.12 - a little bit of volatility for some time
13.28 - so for me I think if you have a volatile
15.40 - January you will have a volatile quarter
17.64 - at the very least I mean it's possible
19.72 - that if you have a volatile month in
21.48 - January you're going to have like Tony
23.32 - said a volatile quarter maybe but
25.36 - there's absolutely no evidence or
27.76 - statistical proof whatsoever that says a
30.12 - volatile January leads to a volatile
32.28 - year
