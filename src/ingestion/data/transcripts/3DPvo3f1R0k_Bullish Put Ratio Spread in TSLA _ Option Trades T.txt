0.56 - welcome to option trades today I'm Tony
2.68 - the Baptist and I have a trade idea for
4.32 - you today January 30th
7.20 - 2025 but first as I always do let's take
10.20 - a look at the market Emin S&P is down
14.04 - $7.75 NASDAQ down $76 you can see here
18.08 - the &ps have had a good $50 plus range
21.76 - today basically unchanged down eight
24.68 - after uh meta earnings and after uh
28.60 - which meta was significantly higher also
30.88 - uh Tesla earnings which Tesla was also
33.80 - significantly higher uh IBM was actually
36.56 - one of the biggest movers of the group
38.44 - if you can believe that up almost $30
40.68 - this Market was a lot stronger but it's
42.56 - given back if not all of it so far today
45.64 - Russell up 19 and change that's your
47.84 - leader in the clubhouse and the Dow uh
50.36 - basically unchanged down four volatility
54.08 - surprising with the amount of movement
55.60 - we've had today that volatility is
57.80 - catching a small little bit here is near
60.00 - the high of the day of 17 but it is only
62.76 - up 5 cents keep an eye on volatility
65.88 - volatility starts creeping higher this
67.96 - downward move in the &ps and NASDAQ
70.36 - might get exaggerated uh bonds up 13
73.56 - ticks after trading up to 115 bonds have
76.32 - had a good3 $4,000 move after making
79.04 - their lows uh just about two weeks ago
82.04 - back on January 15th I have no position
84.88 - in the bonds um I'm the world's worst
87.12 - commodity Trader all right what are we
88.92 - going to look at today well I think we
90.88 - have to do a post earnings trade now I
93.72 - full disclosure took off my Tesla
96.92 - position that I had on uh earlier today
100.44 - had it since last year it was one of my
103.12 - largest Losers of 2024 in 2024 for about
107.60 - nine or 10 months Tesla was one of my
109.84 - biggest winners and I gave it all back
112.64 - and some the last two or three months of
116.04 - 2024 but was able to get it all back and
119.04 - some today with Tesla coming inside the
122.80 - expected move closed all of that and uh
126.40 - well I'll show you in Tesla what's going
128.24 - on in there we'll look at these March uh
131.00 - options I was in the Feb options I'll
133.16 - show you the febs right now you'll
134.80 - notice here that my my puts at the time
137.44 - were the 390 puts you can see here that
139.76 - they're down $7 and change but the stock
141.72 - was up around 15 bucks the puts were
144.64 - down by $15 and the calls that I was
147.40 - short were only up a dollar it was a it
150.16 - would end up being a great trade
151.72 - sometimes you stay mechanical you get
153.56 - lucky stay mechanical out there boys and
156.40 - girls and get lucky too if you work the
159.08 - process work the process now I got to
160.64 - try to get the same thing in Goldman
162.08 - Sachs because Goldman Sachs was my other
164.20 - trade from 2024 that's left over um that
168.48 - that is giving me fits but here's the
170.92 - problem with Goldman Sachs Ivy rank is
173.24 - extremely low at 18 stock hasn't had a
176.00 - down tick the stock didn't cooperate at
177.84 - least Tesla had some back and forth
179.24 - action giving you a chance to put on
181.08 - some Deltas take off some Deltas Goldman
183.32 - Sachs has just been a rip your- face off
184.88 - rally I'm going to look to close my
186.72 - Goldman Sachs trade now take the loss in
189.36 - there because of the IV rank all right
191.80 - all that being said let's get to today's
193.60 - trade I'm going to go to Tesla even
196.04 - though it's had earnings look at this
198.36 - the ivx 5day change if you notice some
201.32 - of these other stocks that have had um
204.12 - uh earnings look at meta Ivy rank is
206.04 - down by twice as much and the I I'm
208.28 - sorry the ivx 5 day Chang is down by
210.68 - twice as much and the ivv rank is 19
213.76 - Tesla Ivy rank is still 41 and the and
217.36 - the IV 5day adjusted is only down five
220.84 - so I think this move in volatility and
224.16 - again I talked about it when I was
225.48 - closing my trade on the show uh Ivy rank
227.96 - was in the 70s for Tesla prior to its
231.36 - earnings this morning it got into the
233.60 - low to mid 30s after the rally and now
237.64 - it's back up to 41 so expand a little
240.40 - bit after earnings even though it's got
242.88 - decimated for volatility I'm going to do
245.20 - a directional omnidirectional trade uh
248.44 - in Tesla March volatility is actually
251.20 - the same as fed volatility but you know
254.12 - with 21 days to go to expiration I'm
256.92 - going to look for March options that
258.76 - have 50 days with 45 days being optimal
262.60 - the March monthlies are the place to be
265.76 - at least in my opinion what did I do
268.48 - here I went and did a 1X two put ratio
271.48 - spread it's rare that you're able to go
273.72 - around these 15 Delta options it's rare
276.72 - because you need the implied volatility
278.16 - to be high I went around these 15-day
281.00 - options I bought the 335 puts one time I
285.68 - sold the 320 puts two times um I did
290.20 - this for
292.96 - $294 cents I believe wow this has really
295.68 - come in already let's check on the
298.12 - follow page if I have the right price
300.00 - here because it usually doesn't move
301.80 - that much that quickly let's go in here
303.64 - to just click on Bob the trader yes I
305.84 - did it at
307.48 - $2.94 with the stock just about $2 lower
312.20 - than where it is right now you'll notice
314.80 - this trade uh only has seven Deltas so
318.12 - if a stock moves $2 maybe this trade
322.00 - should be six or seven cents 8 cents 10
325.88 - cents lower but certainly not uh 40
329.00 - cents lower that's volatility
330.64 - Contracting by a lot here you can see
333.08 - the puts that I'm buying are down by $3
335.28 - and change the puts that I'm selling are
337.56 - down by $2 in change that means this
340.08 - spread even from yesterday is in by
342.76 - another dollar I got
345.40 - $2.94 uh for this trade it does use um
349.08 - about $88,500 in buying power um so it
353.12 - does it is a trade that um requires uh a
358.32 - a sizable account I mean one that fits
360.12 - 8,500 bucks this is a $115 wide uh ratio
364.76 - spread it is rare to be able to go $15
367.32 - $2 wide even on a $300 stock um which
371.00 - gives you a nice cushion or a nice uh um
374.96 - win uh area on your on your spread
378.36 - remember your break even is going to be
380.00 - this green line which is $15 below uh
384.52 - your 20 strike which brings you down to
386.68 - around 305 plus whatever credit you
389.24 - receive ceive on this uh it you'll
391.76 - notice my Delta is only seven
393.40 - yesterday's or Tuesday's TSM trade uh
396.56 - was was double uh that amount of Delta
399.20 - so it's a fairly delta neutral you can
402.00 - make as much as
403.40 - $1,500 on a 320 pin here but what do you
407.00 - really want Tesla to do you want Tesla
409.04 - to go up immediately if not sooner as
411.16 - you can see here um this credit Will
413.84 - contract that's what you want what's my
416.04 - goal on here like it always is around a
418.52 - buck buck and a half two bucks something
420.36 - like that if listen if this G goes down
422.48 - by a dollar in the next couple of days I
424.56 - would I would take it off but those
426.44 - playing in an IRA account this buying
429.40 - power effect is going to be closer to 30
431.20 - some OD thousand so what would I do in
433.60 - that case I might go down to something
435.88 - like I don't know the the 220 puts um if
439.32 - you buy the 220 puts you'll change your
442.04 - your buying power ever so slightly here
444.16 - you go I'll take it off for a moment uh
446.96 - it's $8,300 well uh pretty much makes it
450.40 - the same oh because it's a margin
451.60 - account gotcha um you could change you
453.48 - could change your buying power uh by a
455.96 - multiple of of four or five times
458.64 - instead of being 30,000 it would be
460.56 - closer to $88,000 of course you do give
462.92 - up a little bit of that credit but you
464.52 - know what you freed up a lot of buying
467.16 - power by making that uh by making that I
470.24 - don't know what do you want to call it
471.72 - uh a wide uh ratio wide butterfly broken
477.80 - wing butterfly I guess you can call it
479.80 - that here's Tesla rallying well I hope
481.64 - you were able to watch this trade when I
483.36 - put it on in the follow page so that
485.88 - that you could have seen it in real time
487.60 - and not when you're uh watching the
489.36 - trade right now let me get to the follow
491.12 - page here I'm so sorry there we go um
494.12 - you'll notice here I put on my I took
496.00 - off here's where I took off my other
497.16 - trade Tesla right away when Tesla was up
499.44 - around
500.52 - $47 got lucky because this trade had a
502.80 - little bit of uh uh long Delta to it
506.16 - here here you got it the puts are down
507.88 - $14 calls are on only up I explained
510.84 - everything to have to stay mechanical
512.52 - sometimes you get lucky you'll see all
513.88 - the trades I do Marvell give me a little
515.84 - bit of fits today had to roll up the
517.16 - untested side gold continues to Rally
519.40 - had to roll up the untested side staying
520.96 - mechanical TSM uh even though I put on a
523.92 - bullish trade on there on Tuesday it's
526.00 - gone too far too quickly had to roll up
527.96 - the the puts and then here uh I made my
530.72 - trade right at 10 o'clock soon as we got
532.52 - off the uh the show I did an
535.16 - omnidirectional post earnings earnings
537.16 - have come out already they came out last
538.56 - night slight bullish because you want
540.48 - the stock to go higher even though you
542.08 - can make your max money at $320 which
545.28 - would be $1,500 plus the credit you
547.48 - receive wide put ratio spread again this
551.48 - trade has a 90 87% probably a success
555.80 - $12 a day in Theta Decay wow it's really
559.04 - uh coming off here now that the stock is
561.08 - rallying a little bit well hope you
562.60 - quote it Max profit $1,700 because it's
565.28 - $1,500 plus whatever credit you receive
