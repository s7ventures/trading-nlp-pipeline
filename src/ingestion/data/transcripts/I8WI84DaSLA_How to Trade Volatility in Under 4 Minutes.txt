0.08 - implied volatility and strike distance
2.16 - so we've discussed that selling options
3.84 - when IB is higher can lead to better
5.32 - performance we know this we're going to
7.28 - take a look backwards you know we're
9.20 - going to look at the frequency and level
10.68 - of implied volatility by examining the
12.28 - distribution of the vix over the past 20
15.28 - years because we know as a premium
17.88 - seller we collect richer premiums when
19.76 - implied volatility is elevated so if we
23.04 - categorize trades based on vix into four
25.96 - groups with an equal number of
27.64 - occurrences the vix levels would be
29.08 - divided as follows this is equal number
31.36 - of occurrences less than 13 13 to 16 16
34.48 - to 22 and then greater than 22 all right
37.08 - next we want to examine how the
38.44 - volatility expansion or contraction
41.16 - impacts strike price colle selection and
43.72 - as a result performance so we tested 16
46.80 - Delta strangles with 45 days to go and
49.28 - managed all the positions at 21dt and
51.68 - here's what we learned as the vix
53.28 - increases the distances between the
55.40 - strikes and the underlying price for the
56.80 - same Delta options expand rapidly when
58.64 - the vix is above 22 which was the high
60.44 - end of this range the distances for both
62.84 - the put in the call side more than
64.60 - double compared to when the vix is 13
67.12 - also the credit received as a percentage
69.60 - of the stock price increases
71.48 - significantly pushing the strikes even
73.60 - further so what what happens here um and
78.24 - again you you can see the credit as a
80.16 - percenter price you know when the vix is
82.60 - high now right now the vix is let's call
84.92 - it 20ish just under 20 sure just under
89.40 - 20 be in that 16 to 22 range which is 7%
93.96 - away on the call side and I'm sorry 7
97.92 - away on the put side and six away on the
99.44 - call or five away on the call side
100.88 - that's still pretty good yeah sure sure
102.88 - okay and the credit received is a big
104.48 - number right now this is where you want
105.92 - to be this is kind of like the sweet
107.72 - spot in this 16 to 22 maybe over 22 is
110.72 - even a little sweeter but you don't want
112.32 - like over 35 or 40 gets really tough in
115.12 - terms of performance uncertainty higher
117.20 - uncertainty and higher volatility and
119.12 - high markets particularly when the vix
121.48 - is between 12 I'm I'm sorry between 16
123.96 - and 22 it results in slightly lower win
126.96 - rates however all the win rates are
128.72 - great for premium sellers clearly wider
131.72 - strikes in high IV environments lead to
133.52 - much better performance in terms of RLC
135.56 - so what happens here is you can see that
137.44 - we get down to that 16 to 22 which is
139.28 - second from the bottom the win rate 76%
142.12 - which seems like okay that's not great
144.16 - because there's more more of those
145.88 - stocks are in play but the average
147.72 - return on capital is quite High and the
149.44 - credit percent of price remains high so
152.56 - you get so you get paid for the extra
154.24 - risk you get paid for the yeah the win
156.64 - rate drops a little bit but but the
158.40 - return on Capital goes up and the credit
160.28 - as a percent of the price goes up it's
161.84 - just a lot more stuff to do a lot a lot
164.44 - more adjustments to be made just a lot
166.40 - easier to manage the portfolio so a
168.84 - bunch of different takeaways First
170.60 - Option premium is significantly higher
172.16 - in markets with elevated IV leading to
174.40 - wider distances between the strikes and
176.04 - the underlying price that's good because
177.88 - you don't want to get in a situation
179.60 - where where the strike selection is too
182.36 - close or the strike selection is too
184.20 - near where the stock is trading makes it
186.00 - really hard and the benefits uh premium
189.00 - Sellers as the realized success rate and
192.76 - return on Capital are greatly improved
194.72 - even though the theoretical pop Remains
197.00 - the Same at the time of order entry
199.44 - pretty nice I mean good refresher on
201.48 - really basically what you're looking at
202.88 - here is when you have higher implied
204.60 - volatility once again you know everybody
206.96 - will say you know you should think about
208.60 - shying away
210.36 - um from that because you have more risk
212.08 - but really that risk is rewarded by a
214.36 - return on Capital and still a high win
217.64 - rate is that yeah in the tasty world we
220.00 - we kind of go counter to everything else
221.80 - and the higher the implied volatility
223.56 - the better the environment for trading
